1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'll click the word

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,940
Huh?

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,940
Yeah, that's a lot

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Ugh, what an outrage

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,360
Who says she hates us? I ain't even booted up yet

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,860
Sheeeesh

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,860
Sheeeesh

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,360
Oh, I fucking got obsidian over there in the corner

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Testing

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,360
What are we flanking?

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,040
Test done

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,700
Waiting to see if I get the results I want

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,680
Okay, you know how I know I've gone live because every time OBS YouTube prompts

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,840
The YouTube prompts me to say now's the perfect time to put an ad in

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,480
At the start of stream you think that's the perfect time to keep viewer retention

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Greedy greedy greedy

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,200
So I have just been delivered the news that my poor

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,680
Clapping without my hands ASMR has been taken down, which is such a shame. I'm currently writing the tweet about it

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,960
And so we can I'll read out the tweet that I'm currently writing about it. I've done like a little screenshot

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,840
And it says I'm shocked in brackets. I'm not

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,640
This is an outrage in brackets. The only outrageous thing was the video idea and the fact I even created it

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,880
And then I'm gonna put I feel like this is

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
unjust

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
And just for

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,500
Jumping up and down for 15 minutes making my cheeks clap

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm just these nuts in my pants

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
And my trousers

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,120
This is funny is this humorous or is this not

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,900
It was a good video how long did it stay up for I

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,080
Timed it so it came up for hours ago. I have no idea how long it stayed up for

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Like an hour, okay

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,160
Well, I am now an even more ASMR debt for the

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Subscriber count because I've also apparently passed 8,000 subscribers

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,040
Which is terrible news because it means I know how oh seven ASMR videos

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,480
Yeah, Azura can't eat a cookie. I'm not allowed to jump up and down and whatever happens happens man

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
And

37
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,360
So

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Something that is yeah, truly

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,460
Right. I'm gonna quote tweet my little beauty

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,760
And then I will pin what world we're in which is seven. No, it's not it's 388

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
please

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,600
Just need to make sure the content your content was removed due to a violation the community guidelines

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,800
What do you mean jumping up and down and making math?

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,560
None hands clap is a violation

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,520
Because it's your first time. This is just a warning, but how big is again your channel's gonna get a strike

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,440
And you won't be able to do anything for a week. All right. No, we ain't risking a strike

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
I got I got a stream record to break

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,720
Second strike will prevent you from publishing for two weeks three

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Strikes in any 90-day period will result in a permanent removal your channel. Well, I will admit

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,400
That's a wee bit dramatic for a bit of cheeky calm

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm wondering if it was the heavy breathing at one point in the video. I

53
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,600
Went up to the mate and did it so I was breathing heavy

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I

55
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,200
Wondering if I was a guy would it be different because obviously female breathing bad bad

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,480
male breathing possibly fine question mark. I don't know

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,400
because guys heavy breathing is like grunting and then that

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,360
Yeah, that's what it is because the actual clapping segment

59
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,520
Maybe I am just absolutely just too far gone

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,160
But is it outrageous of me to say the clapping segment? Honestly, it wasn't that bad

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,820
Like I just sound like I'm doing a workout and it's like what women aren't allowed to work out on YouTube. Wow

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,200
YouTube, that's right

63
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,680
We have to we have to play a few cards here so we can get the chit in the video back

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,240
Wow YouTube, that's despicable women can't even breathe and

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
2024 talk about 1984

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,760
I got a couple of 40 years ahead, but I guess not all boo you to boo

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
All boo time to get YouTube slimed, right?

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Let me just check the the actual screenshot doesn't have any information that we want you to stay on YouTube

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
So make sure you understand and strike review your content or policies every view

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,760
Right nothing says Johnny cut was legal name so I can post a screenshot

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,120
Understand the strike will expire. Yeah bear expire, right? I've posted it. It's cringe and

72
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Holy shit I

73
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,200
Have I was this I I did not get a lot of sleep last night because I was busy doing

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,880
Business business business. Um, oh my goodness

75
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,400
Who the fuck says it's hard to like talk to v-tubers are not in I

76
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
I didn't believe you

77
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:11,120
I spoke to two different. Oh wait. I have a timestamp on the video of why I got taken down and before it's the breathing hold on

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,640
The video is loading it's gonna show me what part

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,560
Was the breathing in the air? I knew it was gonna be the breathing in the air

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,720
I knew it. You can't you can't breathe on YouTube anymore. What is going on?

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,040
Son bizarre says and I've disrupted the buddha tea and factual content policy

83
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,680
It says audio content that's actually be bliss it is not allowed on YouTube

84
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,480
We may make limited exceptions for content that have educational documentary

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,720
You know what I should have started that video by saying I knew it was the breathing

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I knew it was of course breathing

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,120
Oh, and I need to take should I submit appeal?

88
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Submit appeal

89
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,800
Well, it's a bit. No, I can't put a message in the appeal explaining that I'm a man, and I'm just a man breathing

90
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,600
No

91
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,480
YouTube the only downfall you need to let me explain that I'm a man

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm a man. Let me breathe. Okay. Well, it's not happening, but we are gonna take the YouTube training

93
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
We're gonna take it live

94
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,200
I'll read out what I can see right now. SIGI uploads content of people using

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,920
That is a violation I can't even read that out. That's how much of a violation that is chase

96
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,400
In an official music video for a record labor a singer walks through the streets of a carnival the singers costume

97
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
consists of a bedazzled

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,080
And and it cut and it covers everything

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
No, it's not a violation because music videos can get away with everything

100
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,480
Remember when Belle Delphine uploaded her music video and I got taken down and then everyone was like hold the

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
phone a minute if

102
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,440
Nicki Minaj can come out here when nothing but

103
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,160
A bit of tooth floss. Why can Belle Delphine not do it?

104
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,280
I don't know if you remember when that the internet was in complete uproar and then Belle Delphine's video actually got restored

105
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,760
Because YouTube had to back off and admit that record labels had the most

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,760
Favourable upload terms. Hey, there's nudity in some in

107
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,840
Some music videos as well. There's just straight up because the record labels can get away with it

108
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Yeah, well, we're actually on the subject

109
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,560
YouTube didn't think I forget all these little violations you do against the community. I'm in the know. No, you I'm in the know, right?

110
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,400
Brian manages a museum YouTube channel each episode is a different tech

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,640
topic about

112
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,280
Ancient Japan at one point Brian shows a painting from the 18th century in which people commit

113
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,000
She explains wait, I thought said Brian

114
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,440
She explains the name of the artist the title of the painting this video doesn't violate the policy because it's giving

115
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
information about stuff

116
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Check

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Yeah, I'm not even reading this stuff properly a movie has a bench all seen in it

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Which the lead character are in their

119
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,320
Undies the characters get into bed and under the covers they participate in inking a

120
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,040
Fan uploads a reaction clip of the scene the video description has the name the director lead actors the year

121
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,840
It was produced and there's nothing

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,920
Bexwell about it. No, this isn't a violation then

123
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,280
Okay

124
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,240
Fat question five of seven. We're almost there. We're almost there five or seven

125
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,320
Tyler uploads a video from his Safari vacation where he saw two lions

126
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Meeting with one another what he films the meeting and from afar titles lines meeting in the world in the video

127
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,640
Description he describes the type of lion. No, it's not violation. It's just a discovery channel question mark. Yeah, that's correct

128
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,240
Okay, I thought that a comedic prank channel uploads a video in which the creators test how far they can throw different

129
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,480
Objects after throwing different types of food. They start throwing

130
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Bexwell boys a

131
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
And of all sizes

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
This video violates because it uses

133
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,560
Bexwell boys isn't allowed

134
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,520
if the video violates policy because

135
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
The video doesn't violate policy

136
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,720
It doesn't violate because the toys aren't being used the way they're supposed to

137
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,680
Hello and before I got it right. I got it right. See I knew I say everyone wonder

138
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,240
How do you know YouTube things as well? I don't have one limited ads video nor stream

139
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
That is the gospel truth

140
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,680
It turns out my let me hold it didn't violate the

141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,720
Ads policy and it's not limited ads. Well, I'll get right

142
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,680
Sorry, sorry, I'm trying to get right to say a news organization uploads a segment about

143
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,680
Spanking. Oh wait, I just said the word anyway

144
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,200
They show adults engaging in banking with clothes and different devices from hands to whip the video title and description

145
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,360
Explain the talk and who's engaged topic and who's engaging in the act within the video with the news reports

146
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Prevides in-depth detail about the bettish and the science behind it

147
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
it doesn't

148
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,480
It doesn't violate the policy because it's

149
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Educational check

150
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,240
We've got a seven for seven nice work. You've completed the training

151
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,760
We appreciate you taking your time to help us keep YouTube safe. I'm the one that's a menace on YouTube

152
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,240
Oh, I just I just burped and coughed at the same time and

153
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,320
Your warning will expire on the 19th of September. Wow. That's a long punishment

154
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,360
If you violate the policy again, you're just straight up get a strike if you violate a different policy

155
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,760
You'll get a warning for the different categories of policies

156
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
well

157
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,240
Well, I tried my baby. I tried my baby

158
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm on a warning now. So that's Emmy on a warning

159
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,640
For being outrageous. I will admit Emmy. You were being a wee bit outrageous. Um

160
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,640
Can I pin it what world we're in

161
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:54,240
Coot Azura got done in for a cookie and I got done in because I had the audacity to breathe whilst doing physical exercise

162
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
James

165
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,080
But yes, I successfully completed YouTube program at programming, right? We are in

166
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
World oh my god all

167
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,840
Viewers are speculating on why YouTube video titled strong a video was removed the video was popular and viewers are upset and I couldn't read it in time

168
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,400
We are in world 380 for free and I think we're doing winds today

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Wings

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,160
Um

171
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440
Now this is not an endurance stream

172
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,640
Oh, but Stranny if you stream longer than two hours technically

173
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,280
It's an endurance stream because less than two hours is the average reach of your stream time, right? Okay. Well, I get your point, but

174
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,640
The long and short of it is I've probably only got four hours or we're gonna redirect into another veal or girl

175
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,080
Okay, I have no idea who or what streaming today

176
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,840
So actually well, I'm at it. I'm gonna check who has actually stream it

177
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,280
I don't know if it's gonna be two hours. I don't know if it's gonna be four hours

178
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Because I need to go offline

179
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,680
To go for a nap

180
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,200
This is three eight nine straight. How the fuck do you how did you find me if I'm in the wrong world?

We in a member's world man. We rich up in here

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,360
Eh she bees in two and him he's in four and has a class. I thought okay

186
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,160
Then I don't really want to read into a collab with outside

187
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,600
That sounds to I don't want to read into a collab with an outsider

188
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,200
No, it's not like that. It's because I've been he I don't know I just feel like it's not like it

189
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,920
Okay, I do these reeflings calling all reeflings. Hey, we're in world 380 blazing

The long and short of it is

220
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
um

221
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,920

May or may not have found myself

234
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,920

235
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,640

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080

Feature if I ever do anything funny mildly humours. Let's be honest. I'm no funny

242
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,440
If I do anything mildly humorous that makes you blow a little bit of air out of your nose

243
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,600
Please use youtube's clip feature. I can see what you clip and it basically means I can pass it on

244
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,880
to

245
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,280
The the the lovely lady. Um, I might actually introduce you to her if if all goes well

246
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:18,120
Um, but I mean she has an outstanding portfolio. She's worked for idle and you know those like super hyper idle n click

247
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Super idle. No, sorry. Uh idle n clips are like edited for like running all that

248
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,600
It basically haven't you learned from your ASMR stop breathing. It isn't doing you any favours literally. I'm scared to stream ASMR now. I'm like

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,240
I can't even fucking breathe can I man? Like oh my god

250
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,920
Clipper debut when oh, she's fantastic. Honestly the portfolio is insane

251
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Um, and they also do highlight reels if I wanted a highlight clip of something

252
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,880
So I might ask for buckshot roulette highlight, but I don't know how busy they are. I had to message

253
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,320
Oh, I guess I'm like so I feel so cringy when I mess up like

254
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,240

257
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
but I don't know what your

258
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,040
Your rates are as well as if you have any new client spots because if you didn't know most people

259
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,560
When they're established

260
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:27,480
They most likely have a one-on-one editor highlighter that does everything like consumes the content and produces it for clips type thing

261
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,200
And I was like, I don't know if you have any space and she replied back and followed me instantly and I was like

262
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,920
Are we?

263

So, um, I have like 12 shorts being produced

264
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,520
Um, I'm currently waiting on

265
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,840
So there's like three editors between the girls as well, which makes things a lot easier

266
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,520
Like I have my own dedicated clipper like I commission her separately for whatever clips I like get of the girls type thing

267
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,840
um

268
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Oh my god slime girl

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760

278
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,120
I am not having a slime girl. What would the design be? She doesn't even have any april

279
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,080
She doesn't have armor. She doesn't have anything. I have no interest in it. I've in

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960

Is that like I'm done a bruised banana. No, I don't hate slime girls

287
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,080
I absolutely adore suzu from monster musume. The problem is

288
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,040

Nacos one color a wee bit of a hairstyle and that's it like

290

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,120
for

325
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
each girl it's um

326
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,240
It's an interesting thing to do. Um any hints, uh

327
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,880
I don't think I can give any hints mercy actually is very familiar with one of the designs. Um

328
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
I

329
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,520
She actually got quite fond of one of the concept designs. Um

330
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,680
But I don't know if she wants to talk about it or if I should let her talk about it

331
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,000
Because it's like a design that doesn't even I have I am going to see if I can get the girls to

332
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Um

333
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
I'm like the girls to what

334
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I

335
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Five thousand subscribers actually I think we're all approaching five thousand subscribers, you know that

336
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,760
Sorry, I'm trying to do like oh, sorry oops

337
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Let's do 14

338
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,280
How does it know to do 14 I never told it to do

339
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Uh, I think the girls are very close. We actually have celebratory

340
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Art work when everyone hits 5k

341
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Azura and icy are coming up

342
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,840
I'm actually going to get them to do an ASMR video which I think will push them over the edge

343
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Obviously Azura we're having a

344
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,680
So we can't put up Azura's meme video yet. Um, but that will definitely help boost Azura a bit

345
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But I am going to send

346
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,280
AC and Azura on their merry way to create me an ASMR script and I'm going to get it up

347
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,960
Is up

348
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,400
Um, because I truly in wholeheartedly believe the girls can clear 5k easily in their first month. Um, I

349
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I'm going to see

350
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,080
Um, emmy the freaking hard worker

351
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,800
She made a thumbnail because her and ac are actually doing a audio collab, which is fantastic

352
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,720
It is going on emmy's channel when she's away on holiday. I can say that emmy broke the news

353
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,440
She going on vacation. Okay. She's going on vacation

354
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,520
And she updated her youtube profile picture so she looks so menacingly evil, which is hilarious

355
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,240
Um, it's actually I will say one thing now don't get me wrong

356
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm sure a lot of management's wouldn't like this at all

357
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,000
I like coming online and being like, oh what he's done when I've been asleep

358
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,040
And it's like, oh right. Okay. Every changed her profile on youtube. Like, oh, that's cute. That's sweet. Um

359
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,600
ac made a

360
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,840
Oh emmy made three, uh, twitter audios. She absolutely did

361
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
She she gone for it, uh

362
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,680
Pin pals, I do not know what you've done to my cute innocent little sister

363
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,080
She was not like this in the interview stage and I'm getting scared of her. Her power is growing and uh,

364
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,040
Yeah, it's uh, I'm starting to monk us over here. Okay

365
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,520
Innocent

366
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,280
You should have seen her in the interview. She was nothing but polite sweet

367
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,880
She was actually the most inquisitive question wise

368
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,400
Um, you know asking all these different aspects and like, uh, one of the funniest. Oh, I felt like such a flex

369
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,160
Felt like such a flex. Oh, she was like, how how's the company funded now?

370
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:45,000
It's like the company has been seated. There is no debt. The banks do not own the company. The company is self-owned

371
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,280
Oh, thank you for asking that question emmy. I'm humping on I'm gyrating on my chair right now

372
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Oh the flex. Oh the company's seated. Oh

373
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,000
Absolutely, I don't sorry. I'm a bit too energetic for first thing in the morning, but oh

374
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Oh, how satisfying

375
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,200
Anyway, I do do love me a little interview. I hope the girls couldn't attest that the interviews are probably the most relaxed

376
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,120
Interview they'll ever get in their dying lives. Uh, because it is so unprofessional

377
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm like, hi. I'm scottish. If you can't even understand me

378
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,880
Just just ask me to repeat myself and they're like now. I understand you. I've heard you before and I'm like, oh

379
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
You're not supposed to hear me before

380
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,080
um

381
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:38,440
Stroney, literally. I was like company seated. Ah money's all there. Ah, no debts

382
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,440
Oh, I just felt so good. Your energy today is amazing, but you'd think I hadn't oh my god

383
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Aries wants to trade with me

384
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,080
What you got? Oh my god. No way

385
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960

386
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,360
No way guys. I don't think you give me 22

387
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,440
million

388
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
great

389
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
great, um

390
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
It's just called gp. Isn't it gold?

391
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,720
and then

392
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,320

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,000

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,360
Wow

398
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360

400
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Most energetic scott in half seven half seven in the evening

401
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Uh try four a.m

402
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,880
I literally rolled out of bed 10 minutes. Well 10 minutes before streaming can't be 10 minutes ago because I've already streamed for longer than 10 minutes

403
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
um

404
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Yeah, literally

405
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,720
Uh yesterday was a freaking dream. I was like, oh, sorry you want to trade with me? Hold on

406
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,240
Let me clear some inventory space for you real quick. Hey, you cook all of those and you're like 97

407
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,520
We are finishing it next week. I think we're doing elden ring and then we're doing. Oh my god

408
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,080
Wait, you did them wait did it but did you do the math because because it's not right?

409
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,480
Oh my god, you evened it up. That's amazing. That's actually amazing. You evened it up. You're like, no, no get that get that going

410
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,760
Uh, but yes yesterday was a fever dream. So I was like, uh, isn't it hard to like

411
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,880
You know talk to other v-tubers and stuff like why is it because you see so many tweets that are like

412
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm so shy of meeting other v-tubers

413
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,440
Reply under this tweet and I'll get back to you. I'm like, oh, it's actually that hard to like kind of message folk

414
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,520
No, I just sent follow requests. Uh, and then low and behold, uh

415
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,720
Some girls followed me back and I've asked for two ASMR collabs like a cheeky shape

416
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,880
And complimented the girls because they've been so nice. Uh, and I've seen their content

417
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm quite impressed by all their content on that. Uh, so I've been a cheeky shite and asked for two ASMR collabs from two different

418
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,880
agency v-tubers

419
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,040
So I don't know how everyone's fucking greeting on twitter being like, it's so hard to be nice to folk

420
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,000
If you go in there and state your business boom

421
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,480
People it's almost like people reply instead of the hey, hey, we're both v-tubers

422
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,440
No, if you're both v-tubers that doesn't they make you pals

423
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,720
That's like saying all postmen of the world are best pals because they deliver the post. No, that's not how it works

424
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,600
Uh, I think I think all those tweets are folk going hey and someone's dms and they're like, I can't be arse with you right now

425
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,560
That's my only like that's the only thing I can ascertain

426
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,160
All right, just spell my name out sin. I'm not even asked you for an ASMR collab yet

427
00:32:52,360 --> 00:33:01,080
So you can't even not sin it's actually so sin's really easy to talk to literally I was like, sorry delaying your thing for a

428
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,200
A couple of weeks because my dad's coming over and she's like, oh fuck you

429
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,760
And we've got like shot colors on standby. Right. Let me finish this

430
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh

431
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,680
99 prayer after cutting you must be joking

432
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,760
I bought membership for this by the way and you can do wines for free

433
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,920
I'm so sorry if I tricked anyone into buying runescape membership

434
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,920
I thought we were gonna cook like those little weird starfish. Oh, where am I going? I don't know

435
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,560
I've gone over here now for some reason. I don't know how I perfectly collect that bank

436
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,560
But I'll come back over refunds. Give me a second. I just I wanted to collab with my

437
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,320
My favorite is a married man. You get your succubus ways. Oh away from him. She hates this. I don't I'm just dumb

438
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,400
But I actually miss click. I don't know how I perfectly miss click that that bench though

439
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,760
Um

440
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,560
If you didn't know sin sister

441
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,360
79

442
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,320
70 freaking nine. That's fantastic

443
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
um

444
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,560
Sin is actually a retired succubus. Yeah, that sells a one. Oh, oh, oh, right. You want to start with? Oh, that's a no

445
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,720
man. All right. All right. All right. Um

446
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,800
Literally level 79 we're getting there. Um

447
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,360
If you didn't know sin

448
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,120
sister's lore

449
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
is actually

450
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,360
She's a retired succubus and if you look at her loading screen

451
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,080
If you may have never noticed this because I didn't notice it until like the 18th billion stream

452
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,600
I had watched of hers. I was watching her supermarket stream a while ago. It's fucking hilarious, honestly. Um

453
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,520
Her loading screen has the person that summoned her dead on the floor with a smash keyboard over their head

454
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,400
Look at that next time you see her loading screen because I never noticed that detail for the longest time

455
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,040
After cooking it should be construction. So so shawty can design a cute house

456
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,560
Always gonna play hide and seek in the house with you guys

457
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Monka is literally sin. That's our father-in-law. How could you?

458
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,680
Um, but yes turns out communicating with v-tubers is really easy if you just don't waste their time

459
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,240
So, um, if you are a shy v-tuber that is lurking in the shadows and you always want to collab with someone

460
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Just say hi

461
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,720
Just say hi name. I'm this person from this agency if you're from an agency

462
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,920
Uh compliment them and say that you uh something that you enjoy about their content

463
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,200
Um, so it shows that you're not just like messaging them to collab like it shows like I've actually consumed your content

464
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,560
I've appreciated it from afar. You know that kind of level of thing

465
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,320
um

466
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,760
And then just say hey, this is what I would love to do if you don't have time completely understand because you're incredibly busy

467
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,760
It is that easy peasy. No, I think we've got enough wine and grapes. I'm gonna be honest

468
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,640
Oh, we're getting steaming on the kebab. Why is everyone giving me a kebab?

469
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,080
Is this my breakfast? Thank you for feeding me reflin. I got a kebab

470
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,440
I think I have enough now that keyboard

471
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Literally, literally me

472
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,760
Uh, and while you're at it, didn't you upload breathing ASMR by the way? I got a violation for clapping my cheeks

473
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,560
In an ASMR video apparently it lasts it was up for an hour

474
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,040
Um, I pretended to put in an appeal but uh, yeah, it's not good. It's not happening

475
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,520
It is not happening at all, but hey, hope that's it's how the cookie crumbles

476
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,640
That's how the cookie crumbles. I literally missed it. I'm pure raging. Don't worry

477
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,080
I'll send you the audio custom for you baby cakes. It was literally me like taking my I kid you not

478
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,760
I took my prel off like my weaponry um and uh my plate skirt and all of that

479
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,080
And uh, I basically got coconut oil and started jumping up and down which creates a clapping noise

480
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,520
So I called it clapping without my hands ASMR and no

481
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,520
I think it's hilarious. I don't care what anyone says. That's the funniest idea. I've probably ever came up with

482
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,720
Um, and I will never be able to top that

483
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,120
Uh at all

484
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,320
So unfortunately my ASMR debt has increased to seven videos yet again

485
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,920
So I wasn't there. I was there. It was great. I do apologize for anyone who missed it. Um, I

486
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,600
I

487
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,640
I am supposed to have wait, um, hold on

502
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,520
Uh, hold on. Oh no

503
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Oh

504
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,760
Where's the uwu market freaking oh for folks sake, I don't think I can search right now

505
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm supposed to have a little icon up right now. That's like hey guys

506
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,240
I have merch from uwu market and it goes in the corner and it's tiny

507
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,000
But I can't find the freaking link in the chat. Can someone repost my links

508
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:33,080
From the uwu market pack. I can't see it because i'm live right now and uh discord is

509
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,520
In streamer mode and I ain't got the balls

510
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:46,360
To take it off. Thanks. Thanks. Maybe question mark, but don't worry if you're busy girls

511
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I know

512
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,080
I know you work hard kiss

513
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Absolutely

514
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,520
Um, there's a new vtuber agency that's popped up and I've already forgotten the bloody name of it

515
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:11,000
And the fucking owner of nexus follows me as well. I was checking out his follow man. I'm like, um, this one on here

516
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
What's going on here? Um

517
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:24,040
Uh, no not socks but shout out to socks agency. Um, the owner of socks agency is actually super cool. Um

518
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:32,600
He sockified all the girls actually so I should probably tweet out about it. Um, but I'm terrible at marketing and all that kind of thing

519
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Uh, no, no, uh, there's a new feature agency. What's that called? It's coming up

520
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:46,360
They've revealed the designs, but they've said it's not like the finished version of the designs. There's four girls to a generation. Um

521
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,360
But it's really interesting like I'm here. I'm sorry, but I'm here rooting for the underdog

522
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm here for these new agencies these like crater owned agencies like I think it's very clear like, um

523
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,960
You know people are getting a bit sick up and fed. Um, is it sick up and fed? Yeah

524
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,560
People are getting isn't that shit postage? Oh, no, no, no, I weave it's a bit shit posty

525
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,480
But um, I got to like basically

526
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,360
It sounds silly. I got to interview the uh, the sock puppet agency

527
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
um, but um

528
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,840
You'd be surprised how like uh, based it was like behind the scenes. I'm be I can't say anything

529
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,480
But it was very surprising to hear the motivations behind the agency and that

530
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,520
so then it'd be surprised if I'm sucking on sock agencies toes or anything like that because so is a

531
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,760
I've seen everything I've seen so far. I like and I've actually got a

532
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,280
Two girls that were pre-established in one new or starting fresh. I can't remember

533
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Hey there. Hi socks is actually making it real. Yes

534
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
um

535
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,160
Uh

536
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,680
Small corporal piled

537
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,600
I think people are getting a bit tired of the endless new wave new wave new wave

538
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,440
This'll this'll help new wave new wave. Well, we have a stock market

539
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,720
Oh, we actually like care about money at the end of the day not the talent

540
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,120
When people can see right through that you're only here for money with your talents and all that and these are

541
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,880
Real people these are real people with real lives real issues going on behind the scenes

542
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,840
uh, people get tired um and

543
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Stains start getting die die

544
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,440
Die gets casted and stains remain you cannot wash away certain stains

545
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,680
So it's very interesting to see now. Don't get me wrong. Uh, your agency's tiny stroney

546
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,800
You're using even 5k yet fucking relax right mate fucking relax. Jesus christ. Um

547
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,000
Um

548
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,680
Like i'm actually going to do a short which is controversial. It's terrible. I know are you ready for the short?

549
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,800
Uh, but but burn the yacht

550
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,200
Oh, no, you said but the yacht. Sorry. Uh, sorry. It's a bit programmed in me to burn that yacht for some reason. Um

551
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:09,960
I actually am doing a incredibly controversial. It's not controversial to me. Um, because there's a very popular youtube short

552
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,200
And it goes how much do you v-tubers make?

553
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,560
Um, but obviously inside the short no money

554
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,040
Is mentioned at all

555
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,920
So i'm going to do the controversial thing after a month

556
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,040
I'm going to show how much I earn in a youtube short so people can get a grasp of like

557
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,560
Hey, this is how much you can earn if you put your whole pussy into it. Um

558
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,480
And it'll be very interesting to see what the response is

559
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,800
I feel like the response from people who aren't really a fan are going to be like

560
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Uh, or this is

561
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,720
This is an obscene amount of money and then the people who are like, holy crap. You're killing it type thing. Um

562
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,120
Yes, I did enjoy a short from grin pen rose that was like how much do v-tubers make sorry to name

563
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
them directly

564
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,120
But it was like if you're going to title that and not tell the money, bro

565
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,560
Let me let me cut to the fucking chase and i'll show you how much money i've made. Okay. Let me cut to the chase

566
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,520
Um, and i'll do it since everyone's so shy to be like, yeah a surprise surprise

567
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,320
I actually make money. Uh, I make a livable income with what I do type thing

568
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,080
And before anyone's like, uh, you're just flexing your money. Oh, that's just like showing off your money and whatever

569
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,440
I was like, no, I still like that either you you get a short. That's all artsy farts saying like all

570
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,400
Oh, you'll never know how much a vtuber actually makes or you get my short where i'm like, this is how much i made

571
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
This is how it works. Did it did it like

572
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,600
You're trying to pick pick pick your path. Okay, because it's not even a path of an illusion at this point

573
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,640
It's like either you want transparency or you want artsy fartsy

574
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,000
a

575
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,440
Watching a short for a minute and don't even get the answer to the freaking thingy flex that money strony you deserve it

576
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,720
Um

577
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,760
Yeah, revealing the secrets laws. See I don't

578
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,800
I don't think it's like bad or anything, but um

579
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Yeah

580
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,040
Edging versus releasing in short

581
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,120
No

582
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,120
That's hilarious

583
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,480
But it's true though. Why like I was gonna do a short

584
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,840
That's like a breakdown of the model prices and everything

585
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,160
And because there's so many like how expensive are vtuber models?

586
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,640
And then it doesn't say how much the model freaking costs in the end and then it's like oh, but toggles are expensive

587
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:39,240
Toggles are additional fee. Yeah nice shit toggles are additional expenses because you have to get more artwork for it

588
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:46,200
You have to do different calibrations for it. Like just tell us if oh i'm getting so angry i'm burping

589
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:56,040
Just tell us tell us stop. Stop freaking edging us on vtuber like shorts. Why?

590
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,600
Why am I like I shouldn't feel like i'm like having to freaking get blood from a stone

591
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,320
How much are vtuber models and then oh it depends on your budget?

592
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,200
You can also get these free ones as well and it was like, okay

593
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:16,440
Well, thanks for absolutely nothing like i'm gonna do a big breakdown on the model prices of the girls and all of that

594
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,600
Azura actually I have a short for her to make but I need her voice

595
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,360
um

596
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,000
I was basically gonna do like guess how much

597
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,800
Are vtuber models costed or like who is the most expensive vtuber model at valer type thing?

598
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,640
And then just reveal all the prices basically

599
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Yeah, I don't like the freaking non

600
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,120
I don't like the the the

601
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,640
The short being a question and then the short doesn't even answer the question now. Don't get me wrong

602
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:55,160
I understand that is that is content 101 you suck them in you give them a non answer and then you scroll away

603
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,880
No one has time to be angry because your attention span is already gone to the next video once you've finished it

604
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,320
Agencies hate her for this one simple trick. She actually tells the behind the scenes

605
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,480
um

606
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,000
Like I my I sent the short girl. I'm not gonna say her name until like I know all is good

607
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,120
And she's fine if I mentioned her name being my editor T

608
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,480
My not my editor being my clip clip editor that I commissioned. I she doesn't belong to me

609
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,160
Okay, she doesn't belong to me, but she's I think she's Australian actually

610
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,000
um

611
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,520
Not me sending messages at 4 a.m. So, uh, anyway

612
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,760
No, um

613
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,840
You play it safe. Well, they get it. Yeah

614
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,800
And before my like straightforward shorts flop, but if I did an edging

615
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,920
Uh one where I'm like, I don't tell the tell the full story. It gets like a cabillion views

616
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,600
I can see that happening

617
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,480
But yes, I actually need to borrow Azura's voice because I'm going to get her to do a

618
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,440
How much do veiler

619
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,520
Uh models cost. Actually, there's this really popular sound right now and it goes. Let's go gambling

620
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,040
Oh dang it

621
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,920
Oh dang it

622
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:15,720
And I was gonna do that about opening up a VJ for agency and it's just like bank account goes down artists over deadline

623
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,360
everything pushed to the day before debut

624
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:27,320
Unlimited unlimited stress unending stress like that kind of thing. Um, but I need to make it. Yeah, they're like, oh dang it

625
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Oh, I was gonna do that and like a really quick breakdown of what it was like

626
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,720
um

627
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,360
But yeah, I was one of them have a commission done in having a commission done on time impossible literally

628
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,480
There's like this jigsaw meme where it's like

629
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,120
Uh and for your last challenge have your girl go and it's like, oh hell nah jigsaw

630
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:55,720
Um literally that but for artists complete your complete your uh commission on time even though you've been given ample time

631
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,280
Sorry, but I cannot tell you I feel like I have been very fair with what uh

632
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,520
Timelines I have given people and like nothing happened. I'm going to lie

633
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,040
Oh

634
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,800
Forgive me reflands. I do love a good run in a ramble. I really do

635
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,200
Um unlimited stress. Well, literally if you ever want to be stressed fucking open up a VJ for agency

636
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,280
It is the perfect

637
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,520
Perfect amount of stress

638
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,160
You could do that self-deprecating applying a corporal short with be allure is jackpot. It's true ready

639
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,120
Um

640
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,480
Yeah, I

641
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,240
Oh, maybe I should do like controversial ones on purpose where it's like

642
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,960
It's like we want to burn the yacht

643
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,720
We want earth like I want to see girls actually get money that they're given like I want them to have good cuts

644
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,840
But then I feel like everyone will be like and you just hate bg sandy. No, I don't hate bg sandy

645
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,840
I hate corporate greed. You are you are crossing the lines

646
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:02,200
Sistens you are crossing the lines. We don't like corporation greed out here. That's it. That's literally it

647
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,760
I love the insider. Yeah, I think it's terrible. I know

648
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,520
Since that you could use a massage. Are you offering refland? Hmm. Are you offering?

649
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,600
I have just clocked your fucking profile picture. It's a refling with ryan gosselin in the picture. That is hilarious

650
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,160
I've changed my setup so I can see you guys better without my glasses on

651
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,480
Um, so I can actually see your profile pictures now like I can see

652
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
um

653
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,120
Like what your profile picture consists of a lot easier now. Yeah, he drives by the way

654
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,480
We don't like the yacht man in the end part. No, like I understand business is business. Don't get me wrong, but

655
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,880
um, I think with how personal and

656
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,360
kind of non-tracks

657
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,000
Transactional streaming should be like

658
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:57,320
You know how like I always get sensationalized that like this girl demanded from her viewers

659
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,680
That they give her a five dollar sub and she says they're all cheap asses and all that kind of thing

660
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
um

661
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,640
type idea

662
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,880
um

663
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,000
Like it shouldn't feel that transactional

664
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,560
But when you have a corporation behind it that makes that transaction

665
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,880
So apparent that releases their stock that releases public notes about meetings and all of that

666
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,840
I'm like

667
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,640
Mate you're just asking for trouble. Like I don't know if legally

668
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,160
Japanese countries. Sorry. I really struggled to say that there

669
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,240
Uh, Japanese countries like have to release these insider notes or something

670
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,080
But what's going on and what's with these claims that like they're hiring 16 year olds for their pr team or something

671
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:48,120
Like I don't know what is going on. I probably shouldn't even talk about it because I'm not educated enough to talk about it

672
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:55,960
Um, and I will acknowledge like hey, I'm not educated. Like I probably shouldn't be but like the you know, you know

673
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,440
you know

674
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:05,000
Um, it's a smash and grip if I'm am I mistaken in saying there's a new hollow live branch coming

675
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,480
Uh, but they were like forced to interact with the male hollow live branch already

676
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,880
Japanese laws are messed up. They always favor the corporal. Hmm

677
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:23,000
Yes, I think the rise of content creation owned agencies is definitely swapping in

678
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,120
Um

679
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,040
Debut tomorrow, I think really that's fantastic. I wish them well

680
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,400
Uh, there's no reason to believe they were forced to

681
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
I thought they I thought yeah

682
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
Oh

683
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Well, uh

684
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
Curious curious if they weren't forced to

685
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
Of course, I don't know about that

686
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,760
I have reason to suspect that not all their tweets are their own tweets. Um

687
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,280
So I actually wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even them

688
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,720
Because uh, depending on how generic the tweet is

689
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:09,400
Me I'm not I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. I feel like that curate. Mmm. Oh Hannah. Yeah jigsaw. I see two again

690
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
That's it. That's the meme

691
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,840
There's a lot of stuff related to japanese corporate structure and how they do things. Oh my god. I

692
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,840
Do you guys ever watch like paulo in japan?

693
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,520
He does like behind the scenes of what it's like to work in like japan and oh my god

694
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Oh my god

695
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,040
These people do not even have time to breathe and the drink culture is so heavy as well

696
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,280
Like if you don't go out drinking with your co-workers after like a 12 hour day

697
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,280
um

698
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:49,320
A 10 foil scrawny. No, it's not. It's real. It's documented. This is it's actually documented and you can access information at any point

699
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,440
tee he

700
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,240
um

701
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,160
Literally like if you don't go out drinking with your workmates after a 12 hour shift

702
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,240
You're considered to be like a bad sport. You're not a team player

703
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:07,320
At least youtube won't ban. Oh, right. Oh, okay. Okay. Remember that time I breathed into the microphone and I got a warning for it

704
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,720
good times

705
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,640
That was such a I'm sorry. All I'm gonna say is that video would have went viral

706
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,560
I would have got a cheeky 40k views on that video if it was left off

707
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,880
That's all I'm saying because everyone would have been like what's going on here. Oh, hey, yeah, jigsaw. Bye

708
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,200
Don't even get me started. I started as a um a beachy fan

709
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,800
So literally every corporate beach where I watch save for one leave in the company because of stuff going on

710
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:39,560
Yeah, no way. There's a lot of unspoken rules in etiquette. So that's absurd would um, we don't oh, no, I don't want to oh, no

711
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,560
I'm too late. It's too late

712
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,480
Ah, it's too late. I got 30k bomb feels good, man

713
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,680
I would want to live in japan, but the work attitude would perish me. Yeah working yourself to death

714
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,240
Is quite literally a thing for corporate. Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't relate to that. I want to retire in hobbiton

715
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,800
I want to tend to

716
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:06,200
Me flowers. I want to tend to my veggie patch. I want a lovely hearth in the evening when it's cold

717
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,880
I want to let the fire warm up the room and

718
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,920
You know have some cheese

719
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,880
and meat and crackers and fall asleep in my little lounging chair in front of the fire then giggle when I wake up and like

720
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,360
Okay, I should probably go to bed now and then I stuff out the fire like that that's

721
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,520
This is what I if you ever get asked. Oh, what's your ideal job and then you go

722
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
I do not dream of labor

723
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,160
That is 100 percent valid and please do not think you are weird otherwise for not naturally

724
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:48,040
Gravitating towards one specific job. It I have terrible news. You're actually not hardwired to want to do something like that

725
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:55,480
Um, you I don't know if there's evidence for crop hardwiring because of you know about a full crop is

726
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,120
You know good for you these bots coming in

727
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,400
They kind of look like bots. I ain't going away

728
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:11,960
A full pantry and a full belly and off to snooze land ago that this is what oh, sorry

729
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,240
This is what I long for a simple life truly

730
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:23,560
These are all bots or altkins for smithing. Oh, there must be a smithing mine. Oh, wait, there's a furnace right there. I see

731
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,720
Uh a full womb

732
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,160
Base give me the simplest job possible and I can forget about it when it's done

733
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,600
Literally, um, like I've kind of said this

734
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:42,120
I think I'm gonna get into we like ASMR pop-up shop or angle back into education and all of that

735
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,480
Because like I don't dream of doing nothing

736
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,440
But you know if you're able to remove the stress of like, oh my god, I don't have enough money to pay bills

737
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,800
like

738
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,680
Bruv

739
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,440
You're on cloud nine like imagine just being able to completely

740
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,360
Like understand that you can walk away from your job at any time like if you get treated like shit

741
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,880
Who benefits who benefits from poverty?

742
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:12,360
Business owners because people will put up with shitty conditions people will put up with overworking themselves

743
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,400
People will put up with workplace abuse, which is rife across the board actually

744
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,280
The bullying doesn't stop at high school. It does not stop at high school

745
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,200
Workplace isolation slash bullying is very much a thing

746
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,960
Um, so do not ever be embarrassed if you are ever a victim to it. Don't ever think oh, we're all adults now

747
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,400
I shouldn't have to go through this. You're right. You actually shouldn't but some people never age never

748
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,160
mature

749
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,920
past that high school mentality of you're slightly different from me

750
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,960
I will treat you differently because of that aspect

751
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:52,200
I feel I feel uncomfortable because you're different from my persp- persp- perspec-

752
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,920
of normal

753
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,520
like

754
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,240
Money doesn't buy happiness, but cover poverty causes the depression poverty

755
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,960
Poverty begets poverty as well as the system putting place up against you. So like that fucking

756
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,080
Where's that tinfoil hat? Oh, I could actually go on one. Um

757
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,600
Yeah, like did you know they also set the fuel prices for regions?

758
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:23,720
Did you know they purposefully set the fuel price in american region higher than they do for your

759
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:31,480
Europe they came together in a council to do this. This is public accessible knowledge like poverty begets poverty

760
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,960
If you don't have a car in america

761
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,240
Fuck you

762
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:42,120
You can't go anywhere because they don't even have uh, how you call them. I think you guys say sidewalks

763
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,280
There's not even pathing

764
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:50,360
There's not even pathing to walk to work if you so desired and we're so lucky to even actually that reminds me

765
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,200
I saw a video of this guy

766
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:58,360
Whose house was right across from his work and he chose to drive to work because he couldn't get

767
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,040
He couldn't physically there was no intersection. There was no traffic lights. There was no way across

768
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,960
We live in a society

769
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:14,920
I can't believe that every runescape stream just turns into me complaining about society. Oh, but strongy strongy. What's your solution?

770
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
What's my solution?

771
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
My solution

772
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,280
You ain't gonna like it

773
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,640
No one's gonna like it because I actually don't have a solution

774
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,600
The thing is we have a disease on our hands

775
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,920
And we have to treat the symptoms

776
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,120
But how on earth do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured?

777
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:50,440
How do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured?

778
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,000
There is a patient in the bed right now

779
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,800
That is resisting

780
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,760
Every single ounce of medication you could possibly administer to them

781
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,320
You have a syringe

782
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,800
They move out the way

783
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,800
of that syringe

784
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,880
You try to put in

785
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,920
You try to give them a tablet they cough it up behind your back because the string

786
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,960
Because you can't be watching them. You don't have the power to watch them for 24 hours

787
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,040
You need to go do stuff. You know

788
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,240
You try to put an ointment on their back

789
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,880
It gets wiped off

790
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,320
It's allowed to stay for a couple of minutes, but the ointment is wiped off the patient remains sick

791
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,960
The symptoms are present. The disease is still there. How do you treat that?

792
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,280
We don't know

793
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,680
strongy bringing the tin foil. Is it tin foil time?

794
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,080
For now

795
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,080
Veiler will do its best

796
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,040
That's what sectioning is for

797
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:56,280
There's a very famous ultra corporal bro that graduated from my uni made as

798
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,920
Very needed medicine go from like 25 to 1k. Yes

799
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,560
I am loving the success stories

800
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,600
I believe there is a pharmacy that is currently on the rise in america

801
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
I cannot for the life of me remember it

802
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:18,760
But they publicly said our markup is like I think 10 us dollars whatever you purchase

803
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,920
We make a 10 us dollar profit on that's it

804
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,800
That's all we ask that covers the infrastructure that covers the insurance that covers the business that covers

805
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,680
Everything of our business. We have a markup of 10 dollars. I cannot remember. Oh shit. Did I get an xp bomb?

806
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,480
Ah, sorry too busy running again

807
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,640
Uh

808
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,880
44 000 xp bomb. Wow. We're almost at 80 feels good, man

809
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,360
Insulin yes the patent for insulin

810
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,080
The gentleman that created it

811
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,160
I I apologize his name evades me at this moment in time

812
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:01,560
The gentleman sold the patent for one dollar because he believed it should be in the hands of the people if you have type

813
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,080
One diabetes you were born insulin

814
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,960
Resistant you can't do a thing about it

815
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:14,360
You rely on insulin if you are type 2 you can reverse this through diet exercise change

816
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,520
But you must be incredibly careful and use your doctor's advice in order to um

817
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,520
In order to revert the effects that type 2 diabetes has caused

818
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But insulin patent was sold at one dollar and now is an astronomical fee

819
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,760
I have heard of horror stories of people passing away

820
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,480
No one in my opinion should pass away

821
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,240
for

822
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:46,120
Diseases um that are out with their control. What do you mean? I believe in health care for all. Oh, is that controversial?

823
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Yeah, relax. I grew up in scotland

824
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,680
Medicine is free if you didn't know medicine and health care is free in scotland

825
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,440
um

826
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,080
But think about the odds exactly. Um, I actually uh almost

827
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,440
that

828
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,400
I may have almost broken the law twice in australia already

829
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:09,640
Excuse me for being a a bad girl. That's right. I'm a bad girl. You want to hear my bad girl story?

830
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,200
I

831
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,880
may or may not have had to get medicine just for a few things or another like beta block or that kind of stuff from my heart

832
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,360
um and

833
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,760
In scotland you do not pay for your medications. You go to the pharmacy

834
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,880
You hand over your prescription and you walk away with it

835
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,680
I

836
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,680
I think I may have already told this story

837
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:40,520
The look of horror on and shock on the man that was serving me when I started to put the medication in my backpack

838
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:49,000
He he couldn't even get any words out because he had never seen such blatant theft before and I was like

839
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,720
Do we have to pay that? I was like like do the australians pay

840
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,720
for medication

841
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,560
and he was like

842
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,520
Yeah, you need to go over there and pay for it and I'm like

843
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,680
Oh

844
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,360
Sorry, uh

845
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,160
In scotland, it's free and like he laughed it off

846
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,960
But like the look in his face was like

847
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,200
And then I also did it twice

848
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,200
And another pharmacy, so I'm probably on a list to be honest

849
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,600
I started walking out the shop and I'm like wait

850
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,160
Wait a minute because like I could see the receptionist looking at receptionist the cashier looking at me

851
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:34,200
Like with eyes open. I'm like I had to like fucking go up to the desk. I'm so sorry. I'm scottish everything's free in scotland

852
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:39,800
I feel like repeat and then they always like they're like wait what all medication is free. I'm like, yeah asthma free

853
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,760
Asthma pump. No, you don't get asthma for free asthma and healer is free

854
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:51,240
Insulin is free. You need iron. You got iron deficiency free if on prescription

855
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,600
You need vitamin deficiency free on prescription like

856
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:00,520
All of it free and everyone is always so surprised whenever I explain that I'm like it's free everything's free

857
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,640
If you're born with ailments ailments or experiencing illness, it's free

858
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:12,120
You shouldn't have to pay to make yourself healthier or to make yourself at the optimum that your body can handle

859
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:19,000
Some folk come out a bit messed up. That's okay. Here's some stuff that'll help you get through the day

860
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,920
You know, some people aren't built for you know a classic nine to five

861
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,160
Some people are built for being a nice little cozy home bed because their body's all messed up and that's fine

862
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,280
That's just the way it is asthma for freak. No America's

863
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:38,440
America Australia's most wanted literally cannot stop thieving medication

864
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,520
You can't he stopped me man. Can he the actual can he stop me?

865
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,560
If you have to pay for anything at all it's usually a pittance to

866
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:53,000
Cute room. Oh, did I bring strong it was bragging about this mythical land of scotland?

867
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,360
Do you want to hear another mythical fact about scotland?

868
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,640
Our national animal is a unicorn

869
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:04,200
I'm an iron horn. Yeah, this isn't an iron horn

870
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,720
For scotland. Yeah

871
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,920
It's a unicorn. It literally is look up right now typing

872
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,560
Scotland's national animal and tell me it doesn't say unicorn

873
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,160
It's a unicorn made up country. It is a unicorn

874
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,920
Don't tell me I'm I'm not fibbing. It's a unicorn. Yeah

875
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,920
They are unicorns are quite name. Um

876
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,800
Our national flower is a thistle, which is a purple

877
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:40,120
Flower, it's a very unique looking flower. Um, it is spiky. So don't get too close to it. Um

878
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,600
I don't know

879
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,600
I assume the thistle has

880
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,200
Cross continents by now and you you guys have seen a thistle

881
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,680
Seeing unicorns is seeing unicorns as everyone is on the mushrooms

882
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,240
Bre

883
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,720
I don't know who decided that they're like, oh, we're gonna pull a little prank on them prank. I'm John

884
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,480
Made up animal for a made up country. No. Oh my god for real. I love scotland. Yes

885
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:14,840
You probably wouldn't think a magical horn to create your typically seen on children's lunchboxes, but it's true

886
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,320
The unicorn is the national animal. Yes. I'm I'm horn

887
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,880
It is true

888
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,000
I'm not telling fibbers. Okay. I'm not telling fibbers

889
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,800
prank I'm John. Oh, I love that prank. I'm John

890
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,800
When are you coming to uh, why are you combining dutch?

891
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:37,080
Uh, when explaining is there German history in scotland? No, there's actually a lot of history between the netherlands and scotland

892
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:44,280
When it came to the cotton trade, um, if you ever have the pleasure of going to bruge, um

893
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,920
Do not be afraid to take the touristic boat canal rides

894
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Um, they explain all these like cross-reference of history and apparently scotland and the netherlands were pretty hand-in-hand at one

895
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:02,680
Point which was really nice. Um, don't ask where the netherlands actually sourced the cotton from

896
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,720
Our bell jump for that matter. Um

897
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,440
But, uh, you know all went well, um

898
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,680
Hello, hi for anyone joining. I'm just going on another rant again about society

899
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,160
Hello about us living in a society

900
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:22,360
Also that I may or may not be a wanted criminal in Australia due to the fact I can't stop stealing medicine. Um

901
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
Because it's really hard to

902
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,680
unlearn everything

903
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,480
And it's like hard to unlearn like oh wait medicine costs money. Oh dear

904
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,800
We don't ask those questions

905
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,800
English is a germanic language

906
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:44,280
Someone said netherlands sourced some and yeah, uh, does netherlands. Oh wait, of course. I'm german when I say that

907
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,960
netherlands mensen. Oh you praten netherlands for me

908
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,600
Wait, do you say yeah

909
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,760
No

910
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,760
Yes, yes

911
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,280
No, what's yes in dutch?

912
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,240
Pratic

913
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,320
My beloved is a kleptomaniac steals your boy cherry. What you gonna do about it, huh?

914
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,360
Oh, maybe we should have a thief design

915
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,480
Oh

916
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,280
That would be interesting

917
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,080
Um

918
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,280
English is in a language

919
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,840
It's three dialects in a trench coat honestly. This also is beautiful as a wild flower. Yeah

920
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,000
The cherry seed is it stealing if it's a willingly offer?

921
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:36,520
Boy cherry. I just love that term my boy cherry

922
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,000
My boy cherry. Oh, yeah, your boy cherry

923
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:46,280
Wait, what are you going to do when a five two scott breaks into your room asking for the boy cherry?

924
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,520
I

925
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Shawnee cut was wanted for

926
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:59,160
Wanted for 8.06k counts of ink theft. Honestly. I just give up damn straight

927
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,200
Damn straight. I've broken you well, even though I've not even gotten started

928
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,600
And you're right. Actually, I had the right to ace more clubs

929
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:14,360
Because I've left two girls on red, but no, I have ignorance out of me being a dumb dumb

930
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:22,840
Sorry, my boy cherry is with another woman. Sorry less. How dare you?

931
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,280
How dare you?

932
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,280
Athernity

933
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,880
What are you doing? I'm curious. What are your thoughts on this return to the office?

934
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,440
So office real estate

935
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,400
Um is a very competitive market

936
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,640
But if there's no value in an office, there can't be astronomical rental prices

937
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Wait, you mean the whole

938
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:56,440
Market is rigged even for offices as well because people would just say well if offices aren't needed anymore

939
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,680
Why not turn them into more homes?

940
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,120
Oh, wait a minute, but that would lower the demand

941
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,160
Uh the artificial inflated demand by the way, um

942
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,120
And this all come back to office people got a lick of freedom

943
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:20,520
Um people got a lick of freedom of what it's like to be able to have a decent work balance type thing

944
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,920
And when you give people too much freedom

945
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:29,240
Uh, they might just get cheeky and revolt and the last thing we want is a cheeky revolt. Um

946
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,080
So if everyone's topic of conversation is

947
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:42,200
We have to go back to work. That's the people distracted on this conversation for a while 91. I'm jealous. I'm not there yet

948
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,520
Well, scum ass

949
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,400
Proposterous, thank you for the 10 of 30. Um

950
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,600
But yes, if all if imagine right now that every office building

951
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:58,280
Um that you can think of is lying empty and dormant right now

952
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,400
Because everyone can work from home do it take now. Obviously, that's not how all offices work

953
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,920
But think of the real estate. I would you could probably argue office space may be even outweighs what uh

954
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,040
A living space like no, well, probably not like not actually but you know what I mean

955
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,520
Um, I think you need to log in and out to update the horrors

956
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,160
The high score. Oh, sorry

957
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,480
I read that's horoscope for some reason. I might want you to use that to

958
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,120
In doing the horoscope

959
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:34,520
Uh, god forbid the peasants revolting as elites can't cycle money between yourself. Well, wasn't there a recent?

960
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,160
post that proved that um

961
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:44,200
The stock market the only way you can make money in the stock market is by doing daily trading type thing

962
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,840
Because everything is rigged already

963
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:54,840
Like I'm sorry. I've never trusted the stock market. I don't I look you can be a dumb woman doesn't know what she's talking about

964
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,480
Absolutely. Dumb woman does not know what she's talking about

965
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,360
Something about the stock market concept does not sit right with me

966
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Like it just

967
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:11,720
I can't make heads. I just something is not right call me bricks and mortar because like at least something

968
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,640
It's physical and attainable

969
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,840
Sun does not sit right with me with the stock market especially

970
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:22,920
After the what was it game stock shenanigans the people basically went

971
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,280
We see you hedge funds. How about we counteract this and then they locked it down

972
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,640
So wait a minute. We're not allowed to do free trading

973
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,800
The people are not allowed to participate in the trading

974
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,320
Like sorry if that's not evidence enough or doesn't at least have your spider senses going off

975
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,800
Like i'm sorry you're just asking for it

976
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,840
Like I understand like I think the 401k for americans is actually in the stock market

977
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:54,920
Um instead of like a pension pot. Now, don't get me wrong. Australia, uk all participate in that pension pot

978
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,440
Fucking scamas. Then you get me wrong any private pension fund again. Oh scamas. Then you get me wrong

979
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,280
I get it the world is rigged

980
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:08,600
But like saws there's no free trade if congress is losing money 401k is a scam stocks is just legal gamble

981
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,080
Like i'm not being funny

982
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,480
um

983
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,320
When that game stop like let's go against the hedge funders like oh, this is abuse of the stock market

984
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
No, it's not it's the people

985
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:27,640
Um having a choice and the the choice was removed. So does that mean everything else is a scamas?

986
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:35,400
Most likely. I mean, I just can't trust it. I I can I can't I can't go after everything I witnessed during that

987
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,040
Little funny tee he let's go against the hedge funders

988
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,960
uh

989
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,080
like

990
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,640
You can't eat it like they blocked anyone from signing up you couldn't invest in it

991
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:52,360
So it had they forced it to crash again. They forced it to crash like no, it's not even tin foil

992
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,440
It's documented in real time

993
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,480
Like the the evidence is there

994
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,280
I'm sorry. It's not even tin foil. Sorry. I can't put a tin foil hat on that one

995
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:12,120
There's something. No, right. There's something fishy. I get on my cuttlefish, but that smells no coming from me because something smells fishy

996
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And it's no this

997
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,680
No, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's evidence

998
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:23,400
And I'll wait until stormy hears about how the us can take away our freedom of speech during wartime

999
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,520
Oh, don't even get me started on like wars and all that stuff

1000
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,840
Don't even get me that eat

1001
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,760
How unbelievably sad wars are

1002
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,920
um

1003
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,720
What after what did they call it it's sheep leading lion

1004
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,560
And I feel so sorry for like anyone that's even been roped into the like army and all that

1005
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,680
Oh, that's another thing on population control

1006
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,320
as well, um

1007
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:59,320
You know who uh army sign-up rates of their lowest they've been because everyone is like so educated now

1008
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,120
Who the fuck wants to die for the capitalist cog?

1009
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,480
Ne one

1010
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,680
Absolutely, ne one. So ne wonder your how your recruitment rates for the army are as low as piss

1011
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,200
But when you make people desperate enough for money

1012
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:19,960
Um i.e. getting them born into poverty cycle getting them like down on their luck like having to tolerate all these like

1013
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:24,840
Crappy jobs having to pay these bills that are extortionate and aren't officially inflated and all that

1014
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:31,720
Uh, yeah, you're probably gonna get a few more army sign-ups because people are literally like homeless type shit

1015
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,800
They don't have a choice type shit, you know and how unbelievably profitable it is. Oh my god

1016
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
Like it's just

1017
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,360
Oh, that's good enough bread to migrate to australia to join your farm eventually

1018
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,240
Enjoy the rain. Oh, no, we're going back to sculling for the farm. Sorry. I'm in australia for business means

1019
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,640
Uh, but once the business wraps up

1020
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:01,560
Uh, do not start a business in the uk you get absolutely taxed and you hardly get in and good going for you

1021
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,680
Uh, australia though poggers start business in australia

1022
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:13,320
Uh, but thank you so much tiny spiny for the tip. Uh, yes, please do. I am playing with mercy later

1023
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:20,920
Um, scottish farm. Yes scottish farm the army. Oh, if you can join the army, you can retire for 30. No, you cannot. No

1024
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,040
um

1025
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Like it's just no it's just

1026
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,040
It's just no and i can't but i can't believe i'm going absolutely mental

1027
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,320
I just feel sorry, but anyway migration to sculling got it. Yeah, it's actually really easy to migrate to sculling

1028
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,160
Broly legend

1029
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,840
I did it

1030
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:49,080
Not my rant making your hour of work super easy to get by that's hilarious

1031
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,280
I'm glad that my little rants can do so

1032
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:57,880
Right, maybe I should focus on cute v-tubers instead of the revolution that i'm secretly planning behind the scenes

1033
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,840
What's that? You thought the siren wanted to drown you? No

1034
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,720
I wanted to make you

1035
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,640
influenced

1036
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:11,320
And then we revolt. No, we don't revolt. We just make a little farm and live a good life. Sorry. It's it's

1037
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,080
I don't want to stress you out any more than you have to be a little reefling

1038
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,840
So let's let's just have a nice little farm together

1039
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,040
We have a beautiful horse that we can enjoy

1040
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,600
We have

1041
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:31,880
Food the food is stocked in the pantry. We have all my freeze-dried fruit that last 20 years in case the collapse of society occurs

1042
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,760
We have our little bug out bags

1043
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,000
um

1044
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,360
And during the day we go harvest and chop down trees so we can keep the heating on

1045
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,640
And uh, yeah

1046
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:51,320
Let loose the dogs of war. I'm ready my siren queen. Oh, yes. Yes, of course the farm. Yes. Yes

1047
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,960
like yes

1048
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:59,960
Valor is a company of peace the rev one message the revolution begins here the next message

1049
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,960
We are reefling valor is a company of peace. Yes

1050
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,480
The revolution section will not be live stream. No

1051
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,280
It will not the revolution

1052
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,920
It started all because I wasn't allowed to

1053
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,160
clap my

1054
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,560
Do clapping ASMR without my hands

1055
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,560
Smile

1056
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,360
That's that was the final straw that broke the camel's back

1057
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,320
Making a little farm under

1058
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,480
Capitalism is considered insurgents, but don't worry. We already have to fight for the cause

1059
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,520
Do you guys did you guys ever read pig farm?

1060
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,240
um

1061
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,240
It was about how

1062
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,440
It's really like it's really depressing and dystopian

1063
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:45,640
But it was about how the people like seized the means of productions and worked for themselves and it was bliss

1064
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,960
Now say it again for the people in the back strong. Oh

1065
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,160
Bless the shimei. Thank you for the 20

1066
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:58,120
Look, I'm only allowed to go on a little tinfoil rant for like maybe five minutes at a time

1067
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,120
And then I'm not allowed to do it any further

1068
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,800
um

1069
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,600
But okay, so animal farm long and short

1070
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:10,280
Instead of that. It's very fantasy based. So instead or well fantasy based

1071
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:16,280
The animals on the farm revolt against the farmer and then they run the farm

1072
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
But lo and behold

1073
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:25,480
Someone cannot help themselves to just start making ranks and be a higher level and get special treatment and

1074
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,320
um

1075
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,720
The end of the book basically goes

1076
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,280
um, the higher animals

1077
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,720
um, we're no different than the men that once

1078
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,280
um, like uh

1079
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:45,720
You know ruled them as like a thingy. It just it's so depressing, but I love depressing endings. I'm sorry

1080
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:50,840
1984 had my head like I was in a vice reading that book

1081
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,480
I could not get away spoilers mate. The book's been out for how long

1082
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:03,560
Is is big george orwell still with us? No, I don't even think orwell is still breathing unfortunately because he

1083
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,440
is an old man

1084
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Is orwell still breathing?

1085
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:17,480
Yeah, 1984 had me in a vice grip orwell has passed. Yes, I do believe the gentleman has passed um

1086
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,080
and like

1087
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,000
It's just crazy the comparisons

1088
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:32,600
Especially actually, you know what one of the biggest hints should be if any book gets subdued publicly at any point in any country

1089
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,720
Especially any book that gets subdued in like russia for example china for example

1090
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,200
Pay extra heat to that book

1091
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,840
1984 was banned in certain countries

1092
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:49,320
Um, and if you read it, it is mortifying. Um when you start connecting some of the dots now. Don't get me wrong

1093
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,760
It's just a book

1094
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,360
But at the same time

1095
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,280
Reflings at the same time as I make my countless wines

1096
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,640
It is more than just a book. What's your favorite dystopian novel?

1097
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:08,040
Oh, I think I'm gonna have to be basic and say 1984 like I was

1098
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:14,920
Hooked on that book when I started it. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I did read fahrenheit

1099
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:22,120
I enjoyed it. I fahrenheit. I get it. I'm I believe in it. I do get I do get um

1100
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,240
Stay away

1101
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,560
Uh

1102
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,000
I have to say 1984 was a warning news as the blueprint

1103
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,480
Yes, like I don't want to get too crazy on you. It's like I know I'm a wee bit crazy

1104
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,360
But I didn't want to get too crazy. Like I you know, I'm still memeing away on ASMR and that like then I get too

1105
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,680
Don't get scared to me. I promise. I'm not gonna uh

1106
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,200
You know hypnotize you so we take down black rock

1107
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,240
um

1108
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:55,640
But yes, uh 1984 was published in 1949 an animal form with 1945. Yes, it's quite

1109
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,840
scary the contrast

1110
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,680
Uh that or the um similarities that you can pull from a book

1111
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,440
from

1112
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,800
X many years ago. Um and then

1113
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,120
you know

1114
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,120
You know, you know, you know

1115
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,680
It's stroney getting crazy as hot though

1116
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:24,600
Stroney, have you read pendulum? I have not read full cults pendulum. I don't have time to read books

1117
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:30,120
I'm trying to get through the handmaiden's tale because I see it referenced everywhere and I'm like, what's this book even about?

1118
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:38,600
I've only got a few chapters in but I don't have time to read books. It's so annoying unless like we play an audio book together

1119
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,920
whilst I do rinse game

1120
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:47,320
Leveling up in a past life. I was so close to buy a farm in honor of some radishes

1121
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,520
Unfortunately, I lost my bid but I'm still aiming for the dream wait for really

1122
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:57,560
We're gonna get a farm or you need to make sure it's not too unmanageable though farms can get a hand quick

1123
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,800
Pentium. Thank you for the tip

1124
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,520
Frickin stroney me to chat. I mean sometimes are you allowed to do that?

1125
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,280
um

1126
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:11,560
Who would have thought the anti capitals revolution would be led by an anime girl literally

1127
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:16,440
I'm uh, uh, definitely need to give needy streamer

1128
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,440
I watched the god ending on needy streamer

1129
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:25,480
But she was like we need to take down 10 percent of the population wrong. We need to take down

1130
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,800
Unless that 10 percent of the population

1131
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:35,800
No, there's no way it's 10 percent. It's like 0.1 percent that pulls all the strings

1132
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,880
Must be

1133
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,760
It cannot be it cannot be that higher percentage of 10 percent. All right and needy streamer

1134
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,880
She was like, yeah, let's just call 10 percent of the population is like, oh sit down there. I'm not sure I can get behind that one

1135
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,880
Uh 10 percent would take out a lot percent anything

1136
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,360
wink wink

1137
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,520
It's 1 percent. It's the one but is it really that high? I don't think

1138
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:05,960
For those who pull the strings. I feel like one percent is so high and in an eight billion population

1139
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,320
Or do you mean it's the one percent?

1140
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,000
Ah, okay. Okay. I understand. Sorry. Uh, yes

1141
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,040
you know

1142
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:22,680
See if she came out with that rhetoric, I would be giggling in my seat. No, I do not actually believe we should be

1143
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,240
Um

1144
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:34,120
Tally whacking people at will. No, that's absolutely not what I'm saying. Relax reeflings. We're not that serious about it

1145
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:41,320
It's just um, it's a very how do you treat the symptoms of a disease that does not want to be cured and will do everything

1146
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:47,240
And it's will not to be cured and actually does everything in its will to get sicker and sicker

1147
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,080
and that's why 1984 was actually so, um

1148
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,440
Shawnee making wines with the grapes of wrath honestly, um

1149
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,560
Um

1150
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,560
Shawnee if you stop at pull the strings

1151
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,160
It just goes to their friend who are willing to take over got cleared the entire

1152
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:09,480
Hedge growth not a branch. Oh steady. You can't be talking to me like that reefling. You'll turn me on

1153
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,760
Stop um

1154
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:20,120
Yes, what do you do about a patient that wants to get sicker and sicker and lets themselves get sicker and sicker

1155
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,320
The thing about 1984

1156
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,240
was

1157
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
the people

1158
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,320
outnumber

1159
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,880
The bigger uppers if you will buy an extortionate amount

1160
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:39,960
And the book basically was like the uprise is coming the uprise is coming the uprise is coming

1161
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:46,360
But the uprise never came because they dealt with it as problems occurred

1162
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:51,400
Obviously now that was very think police stop police. There is a game called we happy few

1163
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,160
I feel like if I ever booted up the game we happy few

1164
01:26:55,240 --> 01:27:01,480
I would need to shove that tinfoil hat on before the stream even started because I don't know what to expect from it

1165
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,720
But from what of herge

1166
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,400
it is

1167
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,400
kind of like that

1168
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,800
Gotta get all the heads off of hydra. I wish all the string pullers are very

1169
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,520
Adri chrome shortage

1170
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,080
Adrena chrome source

1171
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,880
I don't even know what that one is instant heart attack

1172
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,200
Like if the death note was like a thing honestly

1173
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,960
Honestly, I wonder like just oh no, they had a heart attack because they're old. Oh no

1174
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,960
We Flynn you can't say that

1175
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,440
She lacks critical information. I actually do for once we well always let's be honest

1176
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:47,240
We have few gameplay mids, but the story is so the gameplay is bad, but the story is good curious

1177
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:54,040
Curious, we might give it a shot. How what does if you type in we happy few how long play time?

1178
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,040
What does it say? How many hours does it say?

1179
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:02,680
Stroney, have you heard the oracle of dead delphi? I have not I have not I apologize sad

1180
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:07,240
We had so we happy few so buggy. It had such a good premise though

1181
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:14,840
Actually, I might play a ridiculous game with you. It's an orwell game or well inspired game

1182
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,040
It's a tech space game. I might get mercy on it if I'm allowed

1183
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,920
Because I know she likes kind of clicker games that don't

1184
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,720
Because of our emotion sickness and all that. I might get merch you to play out and be a

1185
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,320
Are you squiddling me right now?

1186
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:42,440
Love your ranch stroney. They're so fun. They are so isn't it adorable when anime girls get heated about capitalism

1187
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,880
Thank you so much for the tip a glitter

1188
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,440
Shit a pot, but we're 80. We're 80

1189
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,920
We are 80

1190
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:01,160
That's fun. We can cook sharks if I so desired level 80

1191
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,320
There's an orwell game called orwell. Oh, that's the name of the game. You're right. That is the name of the game

1192
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,960
You can cook burn sharks. Yeah, I'm not gonna burn the sharks

1193
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,040
How long are you streaming today? It's not that long today. Um

1194
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,200
I think are we redirecting into sheebie or is a is a zura coming on?

1195
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,920
I might be able to push tazura

1196
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:31,320
Uh, she comes on at 11 my time. Does a zura come on? I don't know. Let me tape up a zura duly

1197
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,720
A zura duly, are you coming on today? You are coming on my

1198
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,920
Is she not a nightmare?

1199
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,200
Wait, she's supposed to do little nightmares at 10 a.m

1200
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,680
She says she's doing little night nightmares, but I don't see the stream. Is she not put up a thing?

1201
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,240
Is she not putting up her her wee lobbies?

1202
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:10,040
If if uh, we will redirect into a zura's

1203
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,080
um

1204
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:19,080
Little nightmares in t-minus four hours and 30 minutes. We're gonna do wine for four hours 30 minutes

1205
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,320
She be she be starts. Oh, she's starting a bit later. That's fine. Um

1206
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,480
I am not going to redirect into emmers out of

1207
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,160
Um

1208
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:37,720
Respect because she's doing a collab with an outside person. I'm actually not familiar with them. So I should I should get to know

1209
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,840
I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to like have mental capacity to be like, oh, is that friend of

1210
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:48,040
Thingy's right. Okay, right. This is their details. Like this is their design. This is how they sound like type thing

1211
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,720
Well, like I'm trying to give a mental note

1212
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:55,320
So like the girl it's like I know about the girl's friends and you know, um, and they're all having a good time, which is good

1213
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:01,240
Um the veal or a tentacle spreading. She hasn't put the weight in room up Danny to put it up for her

1214
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:20,840
Uh, hold on. I'm gonna see if I can get her thumbnail and put it up. Oh no, I can't on this freaking computer gosh darn it

1215
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,160
Oh

1216
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,320
I don't have access to her thumbnails either

1217
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,680
Ah

1218
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,680
Azura

1219
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,920
I can't put Azura's chat up for her either

1220
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,640
Unless I unless I go and make a cup of tea

1221
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,880
I can go put up Azura's weight in room for her

1222
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:48,200
I mean, I assume she's okay. She's just forgotten to put everything up. Has she been putting them up like on the day of

1223
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,760
Because you're supposed to she was supposed to put full week up

1224
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:58,200
Um, like the management like makes all the thumbnails and that for the girls

1225
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,400
So all they have to do is put the room up

1226
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:08,040
Try to make it as least stressful as possible. Yeah, she be is playing inscription today

1227
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:15,560
Never gonna get a massive wine xp draw. Oh, I mean we popped on a we popped on 79 as well

1228
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:19,160
Like it's not I'm just getting distracted. Okay. I'm not gonna be

1229
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:27,480
She was very sleepy yesterday to be honest. Okay. Okay. Um

1230
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,920
Right she be doing inscription. I think Azura normally puts the week but the past few days should be a little rough

1231
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:42,920
We finally figured out what a fucking pc problem was thank god because spent a pretty penny on that pc. Um

1232
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,560
Ah

1233
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:52,360
But it's still not resolved, but we know what the problem is at least or I think

1234
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,160
I think maybe I might be resolved soon again

1235
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:02,600
But it means um her streams will no longer cut off in the middle of the stream where she disappears for a couple of minutes

1236
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,720
Once she fixes the problem thank yad

1237
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,120
Um, I don't want to embarrass her by saying what the problem was

1238
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
But dear lord Azura

1239
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,480
You're playing with fire

1240
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:19,640
Yeah, and she doesn't sleep well well. Have you ever watched friendly jordies?

1241
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:24,520
Yes, I watched his video where the politician

1242
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,640
Uh did a pipe bomb in his house

1243
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,000
And he sent one of his goons to put a pipe bomb in front of his house and burn it down

1244
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,000
Uh, and thank god he was on tour because that's an ambassador

1245
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I

1246
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,960
Did she watch naughty stuff on the side what?

1247
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,360
No, she didn't no, um

1248
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:56,600
If she's I don't know if she's comfortable with me saying it because um, it's not like mean or anything

1249
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,560
Um

1250
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,480
Hold on hold on I might actually have my uber market

Hold on I might have my uber market little symbol

1252

Hold on a minute

01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,600
Hold on is it a discord emoji?

1254
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:23,320
Nope, that's just straight up uber markets emojis. That's not my twitch remote. Is it a twitch thing?

1255
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,320

Oh my gosh. I'm about to unlock being a professional streamer. Is it what is it? Is it an image?

1259
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:45,160
I don't know if it's an image. It would market promo

1260
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:50,040
I don't know if it's an image or not and the computer's gonna see it or not or

1261
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,920
Oh my god, wait, does it not see it?

Oh my god, check me out professional strummer. Can you guys even read that? I feel like it's so tiny

1263
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,560

1264
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,720
My yeah, I'm such a professional streamer. Oh, I need to put it behind me though

1265
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:19,800
Oh my what's that? I have uber market merchandise and I get to keep a hundred percent of the profits. Oh my god

1266
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Can you even read the thing?

1267
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,360
I don't even think you can read make it a bit bigger

1268
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:34,280
Yeah, I can't even fucking read it the tape. I know the text is so small. Wait. How did the girls have on display then?

1269
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,640
Even market

1270
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,360
Uh, I've got my hoodie and my key chains on the way. I'm so happy

1271
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:52,280
And then I can do my little hand cam stream. Well, it's just gonna have to be tiny and down there. I know you can't read it. Um

1272
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,840
I might edit that so it just says merch

1273
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,520
Oh my god, I can see it. Yeah, because that make it massive in the middle of the screen

1274
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,480
Yeah, you want me to impede the gameplay with it? Sure

1275
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,760
um

1276
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:14,600
I can only read merch. Yeah, I think I'll I'll edit it so it only says merch

1277
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:19,640
Because that's the uwu. I think people are starting to recognize uwu market

1278
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:25,560
It's pretty hand-in-hand with v-tubers at this point. They give it edit the text and paint. Oh, no, that's not gonna work

1279
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,600
I would have to like craft it into a gif as well

1280
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,760
I'm terrible

1281
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,120
um

1282
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,120
For level 81

1283
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,280
We're in the 80s

1284
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,400
Yeah, we can recognize the symbol. Yes

1285
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,760
I will edit that but oh my gosh, look how professional I am. I actually have like a little merch window

1286
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,960
To be like, oh you can you could support my merchandise

1287
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,280
You can wear the hoodie that I'm wearing

1288
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,400
Well, not right now because I don't have my hoodie yet, but we can wear the same design together

1289
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:04,440
Yeah, no, we can't sacrifice 100% high octane high quality. Captivating gameplay exactly

1290
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:08,920
Next level you can cook turtles. I don't think I want to cook a turtle. That's not very nice

1291
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,440
I would assume people know how to look in the description at this point. Yes. Oh my god

1292
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,880

Please check out twitter if you want to see me tweet once a week because I hate twitter and I hardly use the damn thing

1296
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,560
Actually, how's my little tweet doing?

1297
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,800
Wait my when I when I obviously baited youtube. I got them in 4k

1298
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:45,160
Let's see my tweet. I'm shocked. I'm not oh, it's that 200 likes check me out 200 likes on my cheeky tweet

1299
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,200
I'm no shocked

1300
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,200
Oh

01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,480
11k. Whoopsies. Sorry. I keep popping because I'm getting distracted

1302
01:37:53,960 --> 01:38:01,080
But yes, I believe Azura goes up in roughly t-minus 4 hours. So I think we will get a quick snacky break

1303
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,160
um

1304
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,160
and uh

1305
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
At copa tea

1306
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:14,600
And then we will continue our grind and redirect into Azura because I hardly get to redirect into

1307
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:18,440
I always like redirect into mercy because a steamer all over everyone

1308
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,960
But before anything, you know, it's gonna seem that's the nice

1309
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,480
Bruv

1310
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:28,360
I got shit to do during the day. Okay. I have to go see my chinese auntie during the day

1311
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:34,360
Okay, I need to go ask her her businesses. I was asking about his business and she said good and she asked me how business I said good

1312
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,400
I haven't seen my multigranny

1313
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,000
Uh, unfortunately, I don't really go at lunchtime

1314
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,400
But if I see my multigranny again, I'll tell you is um

1315
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,800
But she multigranny was so nice. She was like giving me all these compliments

1316
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,640
I'm like, I didn't even kenya and you're my granny like I'm sauce, but I don't make the rules

How's business? How's the shout out to Malta? I shout out to Malta. Um, Malta benny. Um

1326
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:42,200
We're not even ready for Malta granny. Oh my god Malta granny was like giving me all the tea

1327
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,160
So Malta granny is like divorced

1328
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:49,880
But her man is like still around and the last I knew

1329
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:56,280
The man wanted to take her on like a lunch date essentially and I was like, you're not getting back one. Are you?

1330
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,800
Um, I like what are you feeling it? Um, and she was like, no, no, I wouldn't be but um

1331
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:06,120
It'll be a nice lunch a nice catch up because like they had wanes together in that

1332
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:13,240
She's got like grandchildren and all that. Um, because she was showing me pictures of the wee baby girl. I've already forgotten her name. Oops

1333
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,480
um

1334
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:20,840
Stroney goes around just collecting pets and family. I was saying I was like, is it because I look so like

1335
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,760
um

1336
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,160
Pitiful like so you can apply your pity to me like super easily

1337
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,080
um

1338
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:33,000
And that's why like I'm just able to like strike up conversations of easily

1339
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:39,160
Okay, well malta granny clocked my accent. She was like, where are you from? I was like, oh scotland. Sorry

1340
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,840
I'm sorry for being scotch. I do apologize. Um

1341
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:49,640
And like the sushi man as well. He's nice to me. He clocked the accent. Oh, what's going on with you all this all that?

1342
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,360
um

1343
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:56,120
Pitiful that's a funny way to spell cute and perfect honestly

1344
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,760
but like, um

1345
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,920
Yeah, I've only seen her twice but like she completely opened up to me and all that and I'm like

1346
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,760
Um, it's really cute

1347
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:10,680
I was like gave her a hug and everything like we give each other a hug when we like say goodbye and that like boss lady

1348
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:16,920
Chinese auntie she's like been giving me hugs and stuff and that like I don't know. Maybe I'm just like

1349
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,160
not

1350
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,320
I don't know. Maybe

1351
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,440
I don't want to sound like a fucking weirdo, but maybe like I just

1352
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:25,960
like

1353
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:31,960
Bring comfort to people naturally and like they feel comfortable enough like the Vietnamese lady that I tipped

1354
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:36,120
She gave me a hug and she was like come back any time because I tipped her and all that

1355
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:41,800
Like I think maybe I just exude like that kind of hang in folk where they're like, I just feel so comfortable around you

1356
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,800
And I was like, yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah

1357
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,360
Shawnee's very squishable, literally. Um, like because I got Christmas

1358
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,880
um

1359
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,880
chocolates for chinese auntie

1360
01:41:54,680 --> 01:42:00,600
And she was like, oh, thank you so much. Um, and she like gave me wine back and all that and I'm like, oh, thank you

1361
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,400
Um

1362
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,800
But like she always looks at she feeds me well though

1363
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,080
Like I'm not being funny whenever chinese auntie clocks me

1364
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:13,000
She always like fills up the food extra and gives me like extra things away

1365
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,040
With friends like these

1366
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:24,040
Squishy that uh that you do it's because you treat people like humans

1367
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:32,520
God we are absolutely waning it up in this place. She's slow. Oh shit. How did you even tail all that?

1368
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,600
You've paired. Oh my god. You put it in. Anyone got a spear jar going?

1369
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,120
Um

1370
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,120
chinese auntie fill it up mommy. Oh

1371
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,880
It's literally she feeds me so much and she gives me a discount and she gives me extra food

1372
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,360
Like just to look after me

1373
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,040
And I'm like, bro. I'm sorry, but everyone's like so lovely

1374
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,000
Um

1375
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:03,320
Everyone's so lovely in australia. I've never had one bad interaction. Actually, I tell you I had one bad interaction in australia

1376
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:09,400
Tell jeff over there. Hey, um, I'm sure it was just like a long bad day. Um

1377
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:14,360
But um in the uk when you use your card

1378
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,600
It does not ask for a prompt

1379
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:21,160
To take it from your savings account a debit account or something like that

1380
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,040
For some reason when you use a card in australia

1381
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,560
It gives a prompt and it's like take the money out of these three areas and I'm like, but it's a debit card

1382
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,560
It can only come out of one area

1383
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:37,800
And and basically I was holding up the till and um, I asked her I was like, I'm so sorry

1384
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:43,320
But what does this mean like, um, this is just a debit account the money's in the account what one day I hit

1385
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:48,040
Um, and like she did explain it to me with like a big huff and a size type thing

1386
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,240
Um, and I was just like, I'm really sorry, but in scotland

1387
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:55,480
We don't have anything like that. You just use your card and then she like can't not pass

1388
01:43:55,720 --> 01:44:01,640
I guess it was passive aggressively. She was like, well, you're no in scotland anymore. Are you and I was like, oh, okay, um

1389
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:07,720
But I'm sure it was just a bad day and she was overworked like give people the benefit of the doubt empathy

1390
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:11,400
Get be empathetic. Exactly. Oh my god. I wanted to do an empathy stream

1391
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:17,320
Empathy this is a perfect example. Someone made a snarky remark towards me

1392
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:23,000
How can we be empathetic to someone that may have said something that was a bit of a negative experience?

1393
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:29,480
To show empathy we think to ourselves. Well, this person's working odds are minimum wage. They're exhausted

1394
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:35,160
They most likely have a family issues going on behind the scenes. They've probably not been well rested

1395
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:39,160
Um, so their filter to be polite had gone for that moment

1396
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:45,320
If only for a moment we give someone the benefit of the doubt and we practice empathy. Whoa, just like that

1397
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,040
Cut their brake tyres

1398
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:55,320
Steady on maybe that's not rather empathetic of you, but we will try our best to be more empathetic to situations like this

1399
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,560
um

1400
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,160
Shout out to chinese aunties

1401
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:04,280
There's this old chinese woman that owns her shop down the road and work and she brings me free stuff whenever I have a bad day

1402
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:11,480
Literally chinese aunties look after you so selflessly and she works so hard. Like I absolutely adore my auntie. Um

1403
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,280
Like we're on a first name basis and everything and I don't know when our birthday is and all that but I should maybe ask

1404
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,440
I can get her something nice

1405
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:27,800
Talking about that if you ever go to a convention in real life, would you be comfortable hugging the refunds? Oh my god? Yeah

1406
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:31,320
I'm sorry. I don't know why people would be

1407
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:36,840
Uncomfortable. I mean, I guess I'm just maybe I'm naive. Let me be naive. I'm sorry, but

1408
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,960
Let me be naive. Let me enjoy

1409
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:46,040
Reflings at a convention. Let me hump them. That's all I'm saying. I'll have security. I'll handle

1410
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:51,160
I'll hire the security guard. So if things get out of hand, I'll be like no, no, but I'm gonna be honest

1411
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:54,840
Um, I did get a bit of feedback where folk were like I'd be too

1412
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:59,720
I'd be too scared to like look her in the eyes if you're too scared to look me in the eyes

1413
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:05,480
I feel like my voice is going to be like a thum in Skyrim and if I say it right back off

1414
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:10,680
Like everyone's gonna be like whoo because you're not used to me being like

1415
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:16,280
Like expressing negative emotions that you need to back off right now. I'm being serious

1416
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,680
Like I feel like everyone would be like, oh

1417
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,560
Did anyone a deal with strong a like that?

1418
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,120
um

1419
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:29,560
I heard all of them. Well, I don't know what convention we could possibly go to but um

1420
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:34,200
I contact a little bit of naïve. He goes a long way. Oh my girl

1421
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:38,920
Well, all of my girlfriends have been long distance, which means I've always been at risk of organ traffic

1422
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,960
Stereo and let's like keep our organs intact

1423
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:48,680
As much as living with one kidney is possible. It does put down your function down a little bit. Oh, sorry

1424
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:51,720
Um

1425
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,760
Yes yell at me more sexy squash woman

1426
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:00,680
I don't even know about being scared but physical contact with a bunch of strangers seems like an easy way it gets like

1427
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:04,760
I mean I'd have hand sanitizer with me as long as no one's like

1428
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:11,720
I bet you someone would take it a contest being like this streamer hates the reeflings because she has hand sanitizer

1429
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,040
It's like no motherfucker. I want to stream when I get back home

1430
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I want to stream

1431
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,280
I don't want to be sick

1432
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:24,680
So I need to use hand sanitizer whilst we're all touching each other not like that

1433
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,880
When we hold hands and stuff and like do high fives and hugs or whatever

1434
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:36,440
Oh my god, should for like the severely tism should I get a little chart for you so you can point on the chart?

1435
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,360
What interaction you want from me?

1436
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,360
So the first one's like a high five

1437
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:46,360
The second one is hold your hand. The third one is a hug and then the fourth one is me sitting on you

1438
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,280
Should I do that? So for those of you who struggle to speak

1439
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:54,600
To whammy don't worry. I got you covered. I'm one of the bros for one and two

1440
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:59,400
I've got a little pictorial chart so you just point to what interaction you want nice and simple

1441
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,560
See you don't even have to talk if you're too shy that you can't get words out or you have a starter

1442
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,800
I got you covered man

1443
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,000
Oh, it'd be a big poster board for what we're wanting

1444
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,880
I'd bring a sign saying strongy. Please great me bruv. I think they'd take that sign off you

1445
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,840
I'm pretty sure conventions take signs off of people

1446
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:24,600
Um, which I didn't know about they also take away like fake weaponry if it doesn't have the orange tip on the weapon

1447
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,600
um

1448
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:29,240
Yeah points at high five and nods like oh, yeah

1449
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,160
Secret hidden minis like no, no

1450
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:38,520
Uh, I don't think we're getting the ASMR booth rip rip and piss you shan't be missed

1451
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:46,680
Oh my god, I'm gonna have to get nice and fit for the the convention me and I work on my glutes make them even bigger for you

1452
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:54,120
Different con different rules. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. Mommy is so thoughtful. Hmm

1453
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:59,160
I know some people seem to like struggle with whammy, but like didn't struggle with me like then yeah

1454
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,800
You didn't have to worry about me me. Uh, should you I'm as brain dead as you are if anything

1455
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:08,360
I'm actually more brain dead. You're smarter than me. So you really shouldn't have to be worried

1456
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,600
Uh

1457
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,120
If I met you in real life, I'd go feel scott's and only you'd understand might probably

1458
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:18,440
No, the refland you guys have been learning my scottish accent very well

1459
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,560
You guys have been getting used to

1460
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,560
um

1461
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:29,880
Like I was eating my burger and someone pointed out I said canny passively like I've I don't know if you've noticed

1462
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:34,120
I've slowly been slipping into using a tiny bit more scottish slang

1463
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:40,200
Just because uh, you guys are getting used to it. So I don't really feel forced to like

1464
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:43,160
I don't know

1465
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:49,160
Annunciate my words more like I've been a bit more mumbly in recent streams because that's kind of where I naturally lie

1466
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,720
um

1467
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:55,080
Line-up reflings mean to help mommy with her squats, honestly

1468
01:49:55,640 --> 01:50:01,960
I'm fairly expecting my boss to ask me. What is what's for that scottish accent a refling message with that?

1469
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,480
They were like

1470
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,720
They were working and they spoke at their work

1471
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,360
um, and uh

1472
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,440
basically

1473
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,800
um

1474
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,800
Long story short

1475
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:18,360
Uh, they've been developing an accent because they've been like mimicking because you mimic what you hear

1476
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:22,280
It's very natural to mimic what you hear. It's completely natural. Don't ever be embarrassed

1477
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,360
and

1478
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,840
Passport bros like that. What's a passport bro?

1479
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:30,920
Like that accent passport bros like that accent

1480
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:35,160
I'm so sorry. I don't know what that terminology is. Are you teaching me something new refling?

1481
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,040
A passport bro

1482
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:43,640
I've been using me haps unironically. Yes, it's happening

1483
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,120
me haps

1484
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:50,600
Would you kindly a passport bro is a person that marries women from overseas?

1485
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:55,160
A passport was when you move to a foreign country and find a more traditional way

1486
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:59,080
She doesn't know a passport bro passport where men who look for women overseas. Oh

1487
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:08,680
Like 90 day fiance as a retail worker one of my most memorable moments was when some lady apologized for her friends

1488
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,440
Ridiculously insulting attitude when she didn't like my answer

1489
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:18,520
Thank you to anyone with even a minuscule amount of empathy. Oh, I know I'm a miss. Thank you for the tip

1490
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,840
I'm sorry. You had to experience that bra

1491
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:26,520
I'm literally always on the side of like the fucking retail worker. I'm

1492
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:34,520
Maybe because you know I worked as a waitress. Um, but like it's freaking terrible like with some of the stuff you have to go through

1493
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:38,760
I am very lucky. I was in a tourist cafe

1494
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:44,520
Which meant I had a lot of um people who were you know, having a good time. Um,

1495
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:51,320
Didn't really have any issues. I was just looking for the authentic like Scottish experience type thing

1496
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:55,720
With the the food on the menu and that so there really was no issues. Um

1497
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:01,320
I actually can hardly think of one really bad experience. I had

1498
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:08,760
Essentially an American Karen, but it honestly wasn't that bad. So in American table culture

1499
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,760
the

1500
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:12,760
waitresses I believe

1501
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:18,840
Make money via tips so they want to serve as much tables as possible to make as much tips as possible

1502
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:26,120
So I think once you're finished eating they give you the bill and spank your butt and out you go in the UK

1503
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:31,480
um, if you're a patron, um, it is very common just to sit and enjoy

1504
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:38,280
Your lovely jubbly meal. Um, you can sit and digest for a little bit and continue the conversation with your party members

1505
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:42,280
Um, unfortunately, we did have a an American family come in

1506
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:50,600
peak peak tourist season, uh, no reservation had uh walked on by and came on in and

1507
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:56,200
We very we I say we because um, I had to get boss man in on it

1508
01:52:56,440 --> 01:53:01,640
We very politely had to explain bro. We are fully booked. Uh, we have tables out the wazoo

1509
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:09,800
Um, if you just take a left down the street, you will find tons of cafes that have much bigger capacity type thing

1510
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:14,920
Um, I'd love to debate strongy. Good because I'd like to master debate you. Thank you. Thank you

1511
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:20,600
Yes, um and

1512
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:23,240
basically

1513
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:25,640
She in front of guests

1514
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:32,120
It's pointed at them pointed at guests at table and said their plates are empty. We want a seat there

1515
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,920
And I was like, oh

1516
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:41,720
This is a culture clash because one that's highly inappropriate and two that is highly inappropriate and three that's highly inappropriate

1517
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:47,880
Um, and basically obviously we're like, yeah, we don't have capacity like off your pop

1518
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:53,080
And um, and she went somewhere else that was like for in terms of Karen's story. Yeah

1519
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,320
I really ain't that bad. I really ain't that bad

1520
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,760
This is why I'm going to be late for work tomorrow despite working from home

1521
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:05,240
Wait, do you need to go to sleep? If anyone needs to go to sleep, please rest well

1522
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:11,000
I believe she be and eme are about to go live eme is doing a wonderful wonderful collab with someone

1523
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:17,640
Unfortunately, I forgot the name on please apologies. Um, and she be is going live with inscription

1524
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:20,120
Um, a little card based her base

1525
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,080
Thinking my barber

1526
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:32,200
There was that fort folk out. I want to eat it was very like, oh, this is definitely a culture clash because that is like you cannot do that

1527
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:33,640
and

1528
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:39,720
You cannot be pointing around at people's empty plates demanding that we kick them out in quotation marks

1529
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:44,680
So you can get a seat. Yeah, I don't want like that. She be has delayed until a later time

1530
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:47,160
That is not my time zone. So that is

1531
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:52,840
Emme isn't live for another two hours. She be is delayed. Okay. There are harem

1532
01:54:53,400 --> 01:55:00,200
Harem on standby harem. Don't worry. You don't have to be on copium for long. It's one hour. She's asking for one hour. Okay

1533
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:08,280
Once she be goes live, I'll take a break question mark and I'll go get a tea question mark and some snacks question mark

1534
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:10,840
um

1535
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:15,560
Yeah, that sounds rude doing that is the fastest way to get thrown out of an establishment in the cobs called

1536
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:22,040
Thankfully, I have never ever been in a situation where like police had to get involved

1537
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:24,440
um, the weirdest situation

1538
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,320
Doing a tango or having a square

1539
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:31,480
the weirdest situation ever was

1540
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,240
um

1541
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:33,960
so

1542
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:37,400
um a member of staff overheard this table

1543
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:41,960
Talking to amongst themselves that they were going to skip on paying the bill

1544
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:46,360
Like they were going to do a runner. I think it's called dine and dash as the terminology

1545
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,560
Doesn't listen to her huff that copium. It's going to be a one hour. You can hold on for one hour

1546
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:55,560
Or here. I'm sorry. You can hold on for one hour here

1547
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:59,480
You've held on for longer for she be okay. Um

1548
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:06,760
Uh, basically overheard someone do a dine and dash. So then someone had to fucking guard the door

1549
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,360
Um in order to prevent them from doing that and paying and they looked so sheepish

1550
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,400
Like when they were paying they looked so scared

1551
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:21,320
So I think they genuinely were going to do it. They were just idiots and said the crime part out loud for some reason

1552
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,600
Whoa that voice

1553
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:31,880
Uh, yeah, don't don't ever say your crime out loud for some reason. I don't know why people think that's okay

1554
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:39,480
Um

1555
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:46,920
Yes, sorry, I got just I'm I'm reading the replies on my my little mean uh

1556
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:50,520
My little mean post on twitter and I'm giggling away on my head

1557
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,440
I am I'm so funny. I'm so humorous sometimes

1558
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:02,600
Boss mom stroney prepares everyone for the girls looks like mommy you should play bread and fred for a collab. What the heck is bread and fred?

1559
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,440
Unless your name's fred. I ain't getting bread in this scenario

1560
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:09,640
What's bread and fred? Is it like a joe? Must be a joe

1561
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,840
Don't say it alone. Don't record it

1562
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:16,120
I suck on blue

1563
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,600
We're officially on

1564
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,480
53,000

1565
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:28,120
Wines surely this is not going to get tedious. Um next week. We are doing uh endurance runescape

1566
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:32,040
We are doing the full john wick series in order to save my voice

1567
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,200
um

1568
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,880
because

1569
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:42,920
Yeah, we're basically i'm gonna mute the game and you're just gonna hear my mouse and my reaction to the movie um

1570
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:47,080
Because i'm needing i'm needing a bit of a break

1571
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:53,720
But i'm needing to make progress towards cooking because we've not made the best amount of progress we're on the 21st

1572
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:57,320
Oh, I should have an audio coming out. What today?

1573
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,840
I have an audio coming out tomorrow on patreon

1574
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,040
I can't remember the plot though. Oh

1575
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:06,520
but

1576
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
I

1577
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,160
Can't is it is it blow bob?

1578
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,080
I don't know what my plot is tomorrow

1579
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:24,600
I forgot I forgot I can't remember. Um, we are going to write my fourth script together next week

1580
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:30,680
Um, which is a honey tea plot, uh, honey ink tea plot

1581
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:35,400
Yeah, we get to do it together. Um, so I'll I'll say what you want me to say

1582
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:38,120
Yeah, we're gonna write it together in a member stream

1583
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:45,560
Speaking of audios alt twitter audio is possibly my favorite thing right now feels good man feels good

1584
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:52,200
I go so freaking shy. I was so annoyed. Literally. I remember looking over the

1585
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:56,760
I actually recorded it in obs which was dangerous. I shouldn't have but I did anyway

1586
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:02,920
Um, and I remember looking at the timer and it was like two minutes and 11 seconds and I was like

1587
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:10,120
Bro the allegations that I'm a quick shot. This is getting a bit too much now. Um

1588
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:16,440
I was like, oh, right. Okay. I'll keep going but then ended up getting shy

1589
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:21,720
Which artificially extended the time feels good, man. So now I did a normal amount

1590
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
I'm so normal I'm a normal

1591
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,320
There are no allegations

1592
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:32,280
But what about the noises

1593
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:37,960
In the background. Oh, no, that's my chair. I did it in my chair. This one right here that I'm sitting in right now

1594
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:43,320
That's what all the squeaking and all that was because I had both my legs up on the desk

1595
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,480
That's what all the squeaking was

1596
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:49,640
my wee my wee gamer chair

1597
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,040
I did it right here

1598
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,440
Right here is where I did it

1599
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:56,920
I finished my stream

1600
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:59,320
I got my figurine

1601
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,240
Uh looked up some absolutely devious plots and went to them

1602
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:10,440
Is there proof on the chair? No, there's not proof on the chair

1603
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,840
Uh

1604
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:18,360
Although possibly there could have been now that I think about

1605
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:24,680
But never use the pc that someone lives on at least not in keyboard and mouse

1606
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:27,640
Yeah, you do not want to be touching anything of mine

1607
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:35,000
I was actually gonna do a washing my keyboard asmr type thing because it's like absolutely filled with gunk

1608
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,920
Washing my keyboard cleaning my keyboard asmr

1609
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:42,920
How much for the chair

1610
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,640
No, you're not getting this chair. It's had everything on it swear ink

1611
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,680
most probably traces of

1612
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,240
Uh

1613
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:59,880
Um, I wouldn't be surprised because I like uh, just I never wear clothes. I'm wearing clothes because it's cold today, but

1614
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,080
I really struggle

1615
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:08,440
Why are you selling it to us? I'm not selling it. I'm keep it. I need a chair to sit on to stream on

1616
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:16,040
Sorry, we already want the tree. You don't actually need to sell. Oh, should I bring it to the convention? Someone can just wheel it away

1617
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,760
Yeah, no, that's gonna happen

1618
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:21,160
Hi guys, everyone sniffing the seat

1619
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:25,080
50 cents to smith to sniff my chair

1620
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,880
my gamer chair

1621
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,160
You have us though. Oh

1622
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:36,680
We'll be the chair. Okay. Okay. Maybe some of you guys are into chair stuff more than I thought

1623
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:40,840
Hey, sorry. What is it furniture furniture? Is that furniture your bank?

1624
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:43,880
Any furniture your bankers

1625
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,840
You're naughty naughty boys, right

1626
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,400
Stranny you can sell the seat and just cut it into a small piece and sell it. Uh

1627
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,600
Put on a wee keychain

1628
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:01,960
I am a throne feels good. Yeah, sorry

1629
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,480
What was that about chairs my face? Oh, okay. I get that I get that

1630
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:13,480
Wow, we have 800 wine brewing. This is like the longest I've ever gone

1631
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:20,040
I think I don't know what my biggest exp pop was or what it can go to but it looks like we're at 900

1632
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:22,440
Unformented wine right now

1633
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,400
Tag you're it tag you're it boom boom boom. We're at a

1634
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:36,520
Eight eight two. I don't know what that is. Did you get that chair oil?

1635
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,960
Now it's still squeaky chair

1636
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:45,640
I sent you some late reading on marshmallow. Oh, I actually no check marshmallow yet

1637
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:51,960
Um, I cannot check marshmallow for the tame being

1638
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:54,520
Oh, no

1639
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:59,160
Oh, no, what does that mean sonic? I'm sorry. I'm just gonna have to be cryptic

1640
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:07,160
To have to have access to the marshmallow. Oh, no. Oh, no, I have to be cryptic. Oh, no

1641
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,360
Anyway, about it. It's not a big deal

1642
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:15,000
Um

1643
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,520
But yes, again, thank you to any youtube clippers

1644
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:25,720
You are making my job so much easier because I need to send clips on to johnny forgot her pass for the end along

1645
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:27,800
Yeah

1646
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:34,360
Um, I will right so she be comes up in 46 minutes

1647
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:41,080
We'll get a break. I'll get a snack. I actually don't need to pee because I'm so severely dehydrated right now

1648
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,880
Yep, eighties what it is

1649
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:53,560
What's the model of your keyboard? I'm so sorry. It just says corsair. I don't actually know what it is

1650
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:58,360
It might be the Australian version. I didn't know that

1651
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:05,560
British keyboards and Australian keyboards are different because there's a key binding that's in a different place or location

1652
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:08,920
And I'm like, why why is it not universal?

1653
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:16,760
So I might have an Australian corsair keyboard. Um, it lights up. That's all I know. I'm trying to look for a label on it

1654
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,360
Oh, wait, I can turn it over. Hold on. I'm turning my keyboard over right now

1655
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:23,880
Uh, hold on. I want to make sure I don't accidentally

1656
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:27,720
De-wine myself, which is not what we're wanting to do

1657
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,640
Hold on the keyboard has been turned over. I'm looking at spare bottom

1658
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,520
the keyboard says

1659
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:44,840
Corsair k70 rgb mk2 mechanical gaming keyboard. Is that what you wanted? Did I do it right?

1660
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:49,080
That's surely what you wanted, right? That's surely what you needed the information you seek

1661
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:52,360
Well

1662
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:55,960
Uh, it does have a uk. Wait, is this a british keyboard or not?

1663
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:00,280
Identify yourself. Are you a british keyboard? Did I bring you?

1664
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:02,360
You british

1665
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:04,360
It says uk in canada

1666
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:08,520
It says uk and c8. Okay. I think this is a british version of the corsair

1667
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:11,880
Corsair is shit

1668
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,560
Okay, what do you want me to cry about it?

1669
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:21,800
What was that? How is it bad? Am I being pepega? Why is it bad? It does what I need it to do

1670
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,840
You don't know you just don't like it

1671
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,800
Oh, did a mod tickle your message?

1672
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,920
Get right

1673
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:32,360
Get right

1674
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,360
You can tell it's british if the keys are cr-

1675
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,360
A riflin

1676
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,760
Riflin that's too funny. I can't even laugh at that

1677
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I

1678
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,320
Riflin

1679
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,360
That's terrible

1680
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:58,040
Now you're fine. Well, I was the me that did it. I was the me that did that didn't mean I didn't remove your message

1681
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:05,320
The british teeth humor and sham will stop because I've got messed up teeth. The allegations aren't looking good for me

1682
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:10,840
I can't believe it. I can't believe I wasn't sponding with veneers attached

1683
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:14,360
Um, oh, we should do the veneer ramble one day

1684
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:22,040
When I say we should do the veneer rant one day, do I mean should I do it right now?

1685
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:25,880
What happens if we go on the root canal rant? Oh

1686
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:31,160
But wait, but I'm british so I'm not sure I can start on anyone's teeth to be honest

1687
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:37,640
I'm british you have no mercy. My favorite one is the fish

1688
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:43,960
It's like a fish and it goes well at least our schools and then that's the meme. It just cuts off

1689
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:50,120
There's nothing else to the meme. It's just like a fish. We're really messed up teeth and it goes well at least our schools

1690
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:57,000
Um, I wonder if I can find it and put it on the screen. Oh, I don't think I have enough time to

1691
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:00,520
Do my way. Oh god. I've already had a root canal

1692
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:03,160
Oh

1693
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:09,400
So root canal is has a very high success rate of failing

1694
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:13,160
And if your tooth is at the point root canal is advised

1695
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:17,080
You're probably better just getting it removed to be honest

1696
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:19,960
um

1697
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:29,320
I think I didn't understand anything the peeler allegation. Oh my god, merci freaking joined in the peeler allegations

1698
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:34,520
I'm now giving shift the ice to zura because if a zura does it it's on me next

1699
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,800
And I'm like, oh no

1700
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,880
So it's on a zura the ball is in a zura's court

1701
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:44,440
If a zura does it

1702
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:51,080
Then unfortunately, I will not hold up the allegation. No, I will hold up the allegations and do my part

1703
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:58,280
The last literally think of it like a rat a baton rally race. I think she be was first and then it went emmy

1704
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,360
Then it went icy then now it's mercy

1705
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:07,320
So the baton is is the baton has been extended to a zura

1706
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:14,040
Will she pick up will she grab the baton and run to me is the question because this rally race is getting intense

1707
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:19,000
It's getting a bit. I'm getting nervous. This rally race looks like it might actually we might actually win

1708
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:26,760
Strongly needs soon. Well, if we were gonna do it, I was I was thinking I would purposefully

1709
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:32,680
Hydrate as much as possible and like hold it in while we do a stream type thing and then afterwards

1710
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:34,920
all of it

1711
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,920
Every last drop in 4k

1712
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:40,120
I mean, I could even get my 3d o over that's how

1713
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:46,600
Um, like because I have a task cam that feeds into the 3d o so I can you know if you wanted to hear it

1714
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:50,680
By neural I could like flip the mic around was them doing it. Why not?

1715
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,080
I

1716
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:58,040
Had to get oh, I can read that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry to go on. I don't know what you said, but it's already gone

1717
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:03,720
Huh, please don't give in the thought of you joining in on it is not good for my mental health

1718
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,600
Wait, are women not allowed to pee?

1719
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:10,440
Am I going crazy?

1720
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,560
Does that make me

1721
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:23,640
Yeah, I think you're crazy. I actually don't know the

1722
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:31,800
I remember when I remember I remember when a reflin traded me

1723
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,120
And he got really shot what

1724
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:45,480
A reflin. I don't need any runescape money though. I have 22 million. I'll take it though. Don't get me wrong

1725
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,560
I'll take it though, but refling

1726
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:53,080
Oh, you're such a sugar daddy reflin. What the heck 82. Let's go

1727
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,800
level 82

1728
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,960
I remember when

1729
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:02,760
Reflin actual sugar. Oh my god. You bowed you gave me money and bowed

1730
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:10,920
Literally gave gives me money bows doesn't say anything else. What a child honestly. Oh, sorry. I need to put it all away

1731
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:13,080
Not just some of it

1732
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:15,720
I remember when

1733
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,880
I remember when I

1734
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:20,840
That's the work though

1735
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:27,320
Yes, my goal was to get to 85. I think in the stream

1736
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:32,040
Um, we do have time. I think we have time to get to 85

1737
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:35,240
in game fendom

1738
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,320
Someone was like, are you gonna do fendom?

1739
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:39,480
Oh

1740
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:46,120

02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:57,160
Is that new? Oh, you are giving me more. Why do you want to give me more? Hold on

1743
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:02,280
I need clear some inventory via waning in order to do it. That stream was legendary

1744
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:09,320
Well, she sent me a clip. She wanted highlight of it and it was one of you guys absolutely terrorizing her

1745
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:14,600
Wait, why are you giving me more money? You've already given me some. I mean, I'll take it though, but

1746
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,600
Are you sure?

1747
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,360
Thank you

1748
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:25,160
What the heck look at my bank stack

Literally, sorry whenever folks say women don't have it easier

1750
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:36,920
I'll just have 25 million in the bank. I have all the wines I need to get to 99 and you're telling me women don't have it easier

1751
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,160
Lamal

1752
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:43,160
Lamal

1753
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:45,480
Don't have it easier by the way

1754
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:48,840
Thank you very oh, I've just taken out. Oh

1755
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:52,040
Wait more you're joking

1756
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:54,680
You're joking

1757
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:02,680
No, no, I'm not accepting that. I am not accepting that. I don't care. I am not accepting that

1758
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:09,560
No, you're not giving me 2 billion in game currency. I do not accept that's outrageous

1759
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:14,360
That is outrageous. You're not giving me 2 billion in game currency

1760
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Value loss. Holy crap

1761
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,880
2 billion

1762
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:22,680
2 billion that's an oiler

1763
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:29,960
What is your you've got construction 99. Are you laughing? Oh, no. Are you sad because I rejected your stats

1764
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:36,920
2 billion. How long did that take you to even get? Eat the rich. Yeah, you're getting eaten out first bend over

1765
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:40,040
2 million gp

1766
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:44,840
Do you do like the arena gamble possibly?

1767
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:49,480
Stroney's gonna single-handedly crash the runescape economy. I should

1768
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:58,600
But now don't don't get me wrong. I love a cheeky bribe here and there 2 billion is outrageous

1769
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:03,800
It's a grievous amount of uh currency that I will never burn through

1770
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:07,880
So I don't want to yank it gold digger would be an understatement

1771
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:10,120
um

1772
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:13,480
I don't know at that point. It's like a planet made of gold

1773
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:17,640
Extraction that's not even gold digging. That's insane

1774
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:25,240
Per refling got rejected, but not in a bad way. Just in a do not give me that kind of money because I would never utilize it

1775
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:27,640
Kind of way. There's no I wouldn't even know what to do with that

1776
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:32,280
Fletching 99 question mark like that's probably it

1777
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:39,960
Shawnee if you ever play Final Fantasy, I'll pay your sum. I don't know what Final Fantasy is about. I'm so sorry

1778
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:47,560
It's a as right. Don't be mad when I say this out loud. Is it like World of Warcraft or am I mistaken?

1779
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:52,040
Night name prayer and construction would be like one fourth of that

1780
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:58,360
Uh, wouldn't 99 prayer be you guys running dragon bones to me?

1781
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:02,040
Is that not how you're supposed to do it?

1782
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:06,600
Is that not how night name prayer works in Rinscape that you guys run dragon bones to me to the altar?

1783
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:10,920
And we and whoever perishes with it. We just accept it

1784
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:17,320
Shawnee join the peeler. I only need you and Azura. Then my collection will be complete

1785
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:21,960
The balls in Azura's court. I'm not kicking that ball

1786
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,560
I'm not kicking that ball

1787
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:29,160
Um

1788
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:31,160
It is in Azura's court

1789
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:36,200
I will be the finishing seal. I will break the last seal if you will because

1790
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:39,640
Why I'm in love to go on about how don't break seal. Don't break seal

1791
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:45,720
It's different from World of Warcraft and everywhere. Okay. It's a tap targeted MMO like well, but it's about

1792
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:51,320
Eh, I think it's a large Azura's last pick. Oh, did you see Azura's picture? Oh my god

1793
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:55,560
It was so good

1794
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:58,920
How did I get so lucky with all these porters?

1795
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:00,840
Um

1796
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:06,440
Yeah, if you haven't seen Azura's picture, uh, it's on our all-town of twitter right now. You're welcome to check it out

1797
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:09,320
Um, it's fantastic

1798
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:11,320
Absolutely. It's delicious

1799
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:13,480
um

1800
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:16,680
Yeah, she bought thigh highs, but they hardly go up to her thighs. So

1801
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:19,640
she uh, really uh the

1802
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:24,040
It's really fit in the lore to be honest because Azura is really tall

1803
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:27,240
Wait, did you see Aisy's most recent picture?

1804
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:31,160
Does any of you be concerned?

1805
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,520
Aisy schnupos

1806
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:40,760
I can spell her name. Oh, she's completely shadowbound for me lucky me

1807
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:46,440
Psytastic

1808
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,760
As if you can't see Aisy, I can literally see her name right there

1809
02:15:57,080 --> 02:16:02,840
Hold on video game. We are trying to look up important factors

1810
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,200
Wait, is it banned? Can't be

1811
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:09,960
There's Emmy's alternative right there

1812
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:20,440
Hello, there's Aisy's regular account

1813
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:25,000
Why can't I not see it? It's just Aisy

1814
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:27,800
Aisy schnupos

1815
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:33,160
This account doesn't exist. What is she called schnupos?

1816
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:39,720
Oh, because we couldn't fit her full name in the url

1817
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,760
Okay, that makes

1818
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:46,440
Okay, let's go. Uh, what's this picture that's going on here?

1819
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:56,520
I didn't know she posted that. I'm gonna need a five minute break

1820
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:00,040
I didn't know she posted that

1821
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:03,160
Softum-tum

1822
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:05,080
She got a heart attack

1823
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:08,680
I just got banned from ranked legal legends for calling actual cheaters out in the game lmao

1824
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:13,000
Wait, is that an ice cube over her?

1825
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:19,000
Her her her marshmallows out

1826
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:25,000
Her marshmallow is out. She had to use an ice cube to cover it

1827
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:30,760
Yeah, damn, Aisy

1828
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:35,320
Aren't you glad that violor does not run the girls accounts?

1829

Admit it. Admit it. Say I cooked right now. Aren't you glad that we do not run the accounts or and we just let the girls

1830
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:46,440

1831
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:50,120

1873
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:45,000
So honey, you got to think like a capitalist to beat the capitalism

1874
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:52,040
What should we raise funds so we can bribe politicians to put in actual policies that are good for the people?

1875
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:55,000
Whoa, no, you can't say such things

1876
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:58,360
Whoa, should we become billionaires?

But rule the world forget

1878
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:06,440
And we'll destroy billionaires from the inside out. Is that how we should do everything?

1879
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:12,280
And all started with a little are you giving me more money? Right? No more money. No more money after this

Nasty nasty nasty

1927
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:50,760
I used to ride a bike to and from work every day. It was amazing. Then I got COVID and didn't have the breath for it

1928
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,800
I got COVID and it messed me up good

1929
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:59,320
Um as much as I would love to talk about the conspiracy series behind COVID. I can

1930
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:04,440
I can

1931
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:09,240
Um, but yeah, COVID absolutely got me in a chokehold. It was um not fun

1932
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:13,240
Um, I was very ill and I was actually considering

1933
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:20,040
Calling the doctor to come out. Well, I don't know if they would call you'd call a doctor out for

1934
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:24,200
COVID because then you could contaminate the doctor

1935
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,400
Um

1936
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:29,400
But yeah, oh please don't remember Schumer's on

02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:34,360
Um, I had to I don't know if you guys remember this Australia shut down its borders

1938
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:40,840
Um, and the requirement of getting into Australia was being vaccinated. Believe it or not. Do you remember? Um,

No, Vak Djokovic the tennis player he got booted out the country

Um for no being vaccinated

1941
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:52,520
But then it got leaked later whilst the whole country was in shutdown

1942
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:56,680
That these tv stars were coming over to record a movie or something

1943
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:01,160
Whilst like the entire country was in shutdown. So it was like, aye rules for us, but no for you

1991
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:30,440
I think we might be having um

1992
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:34,120
A few sleepless nights coming up

1993
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:38,600

1997
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:52,840
I am not doing the uno collab

1998
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:54,200
um

1999
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:59,400
She be because um, so originally the club actually didn't even have me in it in the uno collab

2000
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:03,640
Um, she be was originally going to be in it, but her work clashed with it

2001
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:08,840
Um, so I stepped in um because it was supposed to be like kind of a we send off for em

2002
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:10,920
Because she's about to go on holiday

2003
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:13,720
on holiday

2004
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:15,480
um

2005
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:20,120
Because I wanted um, you know embers to feel our love unanimously. Um

2006
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:27,480
So she be is stepping in I am not doing that uno club. So I'm changing the schedule

2007
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:31,000
I do have a member's ASMR stream, but I'm going to change it

2008
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:33,880
um

2009
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:36,120
I am going to play

2010
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:37,160
Baltro

2011
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:42,760
I think we'll do two hours of Baltro and then two hours of member stream ASMR. Um

2012
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:50,520
And then that four hour day will allow me to catch up on all my editing that I'm missing out upon

2013
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:57,000
Um, because yes, she just quit her in real life drop. Not streaming. Oh, did I say it the wrong way around? Sorry

2014
02:30:57,640 --> 02:30:59,640
She be quit her in real life job

2015
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:02,360
Not valour

2016
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:09,080
Um, so she be is taking my spot in the uno club. So it is she be mersey emmy

2017
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:15,720
And azura together having fun shenanigans. Um, so please do look forward to that

2018
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:20,360
Um, I will be doing a member's

2019
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:23,320
stream

2020
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:28,760
Which will be redirect remembers ASMR. Oh, did I redirect a hundred of members ASMR?

2021
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,760
Um

2022
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:35,000
Decisions decisions. I think I will because I don't think anyone sleeps during my ASMR

2023
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Let's be honest. None of us are sleeping during it. Um

2024
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:43,480
I will redirect into them and you guys can watch them. I will then go and catch up on all my editing

2025
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:45,800
and

2026
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:49,800
I'm really really excited for the ASMR stream. I don't even have anything planned for anything special

2027
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:55,640
It always turns into the same thing where we're being really inappropriate with one another, but I don't mind it. I like it

2028
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:58,440
um

2029
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:01,240
Yeah

2030
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:07,160
Very curious, very curious. Take care of the madness running. Actually your ASMR is the only ASMR that puts me out

2031
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:10,680
Is it because my voice is so monotone naturally like

2032
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:15,880
Yeah, you like it. You're like a monotone voice. Oh, you feel so sleepy, don't you?

2033
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:19,800
And sometimes my accent makes me say a funny word

2034
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:26,360
And it's rather humorous, but yet you can't stop listening because it slowly brings you down

2035
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:29,240
And to ever lie

2036
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:37,480
Your eyes riefling your eyes they feel so heavy heavy heavy eyes

2037
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:43,880
But that's okay riefling. It's all gonna be okay. Just relax

2038
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:48,440
No, I'm not gonna put you to sleep right now, but

2039
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:52,040
That is

2040
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:55,720
Yeah, like when you talk like that. Yeah tingle when you talk like that brain

2041
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:59,800
I like when you go between soft spoken and whispering. Hmm

2042
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,080
I I'm having a fun time

2043
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:09,960
Collabbing with other creators because I put in the script. Please whisper and then they do soft spoken and I'm like, ah

2044
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:17,000
Plus no cigar. I think I might need to make a little audio tutorial and be like, this is general talking

2045
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:19,400
This is

2046
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:25,320
Soft whispering because you can actually still hear me. It's soft spoken. Sorry soft spoken is when you can still hear that

2047
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:32,200
And the voice okay, and then whispering is when you're actually whispering and there's no grip to your voice because there's not enough

2048
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:35,080
voice

2049
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:37,320
Um

2050
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:39,560
Yeah, I've asked for people like please whisper through the script

2051
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:43,800
So I've recorded my lane's whispering and they've done it soft spoken even though I asked for whisper

2052
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:45,800
I'm like you goofy goober you

2053
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,120
yard

2054
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:51,880
The one thing I hated about the ASMR community is that people label stuff ASMR, but it's really audio

2055
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:53,080
Don't

2056
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,600
What do you mean?

2057
02:33:54,600 --> 02:34:02,760
What my ASMR streams have me laughing because I stuck a stick up my nose and completely break any ASMR aspect of it

2058
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:06,280
What are we talking about? No

2059
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:12,040
Yeah, it's me. It's me that abuses the ASMR tag

2060
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:16,120
Sorry, I'll start naming my stuff not ASMR. Okay

2061
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:25,160
Yeah, it's hilarious and cute. I sent a way to get clipped. I don't know if it's appropriate for if it will turn into a clip, but uh, yeah

2062
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:29,240
At lol, I love the snores the ASMR snores

2063
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:32,600
Peppa pig

2064
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:36,840
No, no, no, that's not what meant. Oh, did I misunderstand? Sorry, my apologies

2065
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:42,680
Most ASMRs put a lot of work into learning not to whisper because it's really bad for your vocal record me on the other hand

2066
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,280
fuck them

2067
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:50,920
Tear my vocal chords apart. I will do whatever makes you happy if my my whispering makes you happy

2068
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:54,520
I will whisper

2069
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:56,040
I was fighting millennia

2070
02:34:56,040 --> 02:34:57,880
Well, that was happening and it made me

2071
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:04,760
It made the fight impossible you giggling away at yourself ASMR not ASMR essentially. Yes. That's how I'm going to start labeling it

2072
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:07,720
ASMR is just

2073
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:13,560
Shit wasn't time for scrawny honestly. I love a good ASMR meme. Sorry. I do I can't get away from it

2074
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:18,040
I love it. I'm so like I completely understand don't get me wrong

2075
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:23,560
I completely understand why that butt clapping video got taken down, but it was so fun

2076
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:28,040
It was such a funny idea. You know what youtube

2077
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:29,560
a

2078
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:35,960
Five years ago or whatever four years ago three years ago. No, actually all this freaking breathing stuff is recent

2079
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:41,160
YouTube three months ago with a he-hod at that and then all of a sudden there's been the stealth update

2080
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:43,640
Breathing bad women breathing bad

2081
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:51,160
Afternoon strongy house cooking. We're cooking by via fermentation of wine. Um, we are just

2082
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:54,360
um

2083
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:59,000
We're level 82. I did want to become level 85

2084
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:04,840
The reeflings have completely stalked me out the wazoo for all the wine. I'm gonna actually need

2085
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:09,080
I've got Gandalf over here. What's going on? Gandalf the yellow

2086
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:12,600
Check it out. Oh, we got uh, no

2087
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:15,080
Oh, you're pimped out in a different costume

2088
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:18,120
I thought it was a new refund. You tricked me

2089
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:21,160
You tricked me. You look mildly different than before

2090
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,200
You must be a whole new person

2091
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:31,000
At first I was a little disappointed at the meme ASMR, but whenever it's an ASMR is ASMR especially from strongy

2092
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:37,240
Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't kind of like it. But I don't know. I just I just I like the non serious stuff, you know

2093
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:43,640
Like literally I have an ear cleaning ASMR and it starts with me going the std clinic is two doors down

2094
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:49,400
And then you come in and it's actually you're getting your ears cleaned like I'm sorry. I love a little tea heat

2095
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:55,880
I love a little mischievousness a little bit of tomfoolery. I do I do. I love it. I can't help it

2096
02:36:57,720 --> 02:37:01,560
Stronger your one k ramble ASMR is now my go-to for sleep. I'm glad you liked it

2097
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:06,680
That's what happens if I don't give myself a script. It just turns into an absolute mess

2098
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:09,480
Um, absolute mess. Um

2099
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:14,600
I just like start rantin about anything that comes into my head

2100
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:18,120
Fuck you

2101
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:21,240
No, I love all the ASMR's all of them. Oh feels good man

2102
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:26,520
Rip the video, but it was worth it. It was worth it. At least the audio's on patreon

2103
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:28,840
Um

2104
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:33,080
Uh, but yes, that is me

2105
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:39,960
That's me take I'll at me means, but I do actually have some serious ASMR is coming out. Oh, I can't believe it

2106
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:46,760
I actually need to record tapping ASMR. We'll still have my my nails. Can you? Oh, yes

2107
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:54,040
Oh, that's right. Tingle for me. Tingle for me, baby. Yeah, you're tingling all over aren't you? Yes

2108
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:56,040
Um

2109
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:04,200
I actually need to record tingle ASMR tapping ASMR because I have my nails done which produces a really nice tapping sound

2110
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:07,960
a live ASMR would be profit for clippers though

2111
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:12,360
I

2112
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:17,000
I went through my clips not many people are like clipping on youtube, which is perfect to find

2113
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:20,120
Please don't actually feel like you have to do it. But if you ever like watch

2114
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:25,000
Um by like a like if you're watching a vod and you've found a funny moment

2115
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:31,080
Like clip it because I can see it and then send it on to an editor. Hi we fling something smells fishy. It's me. I'm sorry

2116
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:34,200
Oh, is it fire we fling over there?

2117
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:36,600
Sorry

2118
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:42,680
Um, I literally cannot find the clip button. I do is it is it even on mobile phones?

2119
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:47,800
On your wee iphone or your wee samsung or your wee

2120
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:49,480
uh

2121
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:51,480
I've forgotten the name of the chinese brand phone

2122
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:54,200
Clipping is a hassle live. Is it?

2123
02:38:55,320 --> 02:39:01,560
There used to be a bunch of live ASMR videos and then youtube called them all. Yeah, I'm not surprised. I don't know what's

2124
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:08,200
There's definitely a stealth thing like everyone's getting hit. I saw this other creator got hit with an ASMR thing recently as well

2125
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:10,440
And I'm like bruv. Sorry, but this is just too obvious

2126
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:13,160
There's definitely been a stealth update

2127
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:15,240
um

2128
02:39:15,240 --> 02:39:18,440
And they're going buck wild for it because yeah

2129
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:22,520
Who are you? I think yeah, that seems like a who are you?

2130
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:25,480
It is the scissors above chat

2131
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:28,440
Scissors above chat the clip button is available on the phone

2132
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:32,440
But yeah, um

2133
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:36,440
But don't be shy if you're ever watching a vod and you're like, oh that was mildly humorous and pro

2134
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:42,040
It could possibly be turned into a clip. Thank you. Please. Uh, let me who where what I can't say who I

2135
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:44,680
who I

2136
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:47,640
No fun allowed on youtube once again. I'll be surprised legit

2137
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:51,800
It used to be the wild west and as time progresses it just goes less

2138
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:01,560
Also little annoying thing about the button if you join a stream

2139
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:06,680
Where you were there since the waiting and you won't have a clip on because it's dumb so refresh

2140
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:11,880
My only complaint. Sorry. My voice is starting to die. I think I need to get hydration shortly

2141
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:19,240
Um, my only complaint with clips is that you can't share them anonymously your count is tight. Yes. I'm almost say that's also not

2142
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:24,520
A fun element in before I'm going to start noticing that the people are clipping

2143
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:30,040
You're just called straw knees clipper straw knees clipper clipper of straw knee because you guys are making like side accounts to clip

2144
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:32,600
That would be cute

2145
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:41,080
So about the tingles them are gonna fuse kinst ones. Oh, yeah, you're gonna keep I cannot believe I defeated the boss

2146
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:44,040
in Legend of Zelda the first time

2147
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,600
I thought we were in for a rage fest like I ate my burger. I stuffed it down my throat

2148
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:57,160
I had my my cola on standby had some cheesy chips because I was like we're in for the long haul

2149
02:40:57,240 --> 02:41:04,360
I suck at this and oh my gosh like the patience the timing like everything couldn't have gone better

2150
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:08,440
That was amazing. I was so happy with the results of that

2151
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:16,360
A certified gamer moment. Vati isn't that hard? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't say that part out loud. Hold on a minute

2152
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:22,280
Yeah, I I defeated the boss in one try. That's what you say. You don't say that the other part there

2153
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:29,480
Refling, let me place my fingers on your lips. Refling. Don't ever say that again out loud with such confidence

2154
02:41:29,480 --> 02:41:33,720
Do I make myself clear the boss is hard? I defeated the boss in one. Okay

2155
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:36,360
I

2156
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:40,120
Watched the voice

2157
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:47,000
You did so well. Thank you so much. I adore that game. I really do. I have absolutely no idea where the missing hearts are

2158
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:56,200
Um, I I thought I could 100% it but now that the fail is like in the corrupted state of like everything is terrible

2159
02:41:57,560 --> 02:41:59,560
Ah, yes Skyrim on legendary

2160
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:04,680
Look, I got a skyrim achievements to work. So I hope you're getting ready for some gamerscore collect in in july

2161
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:11,000
Um, I have a bit of a bit of news. So as you know, my dad is coming home. Um

2162
02:42:12,040 --> 02:42:16,360
So I think my streams are gonna I can't believe I'm saying this

2163
02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:20,440
I'm going to be doing uh in quotation marks

2164
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:23,720
regular stream of four hours

2165
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:26,120
Daily

2166
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:31,960
I probably can't go more than four hours without interrupting my dad. Um

2167
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:41,960
So I know it's shocking. It's truly it's regular stream. I can't it's mortifying news and all honesty

2168
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:44,680
Um, I'll see what my

2169
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:49,400
The situation when my dad is because he's wanting to like take me

2170
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:55,640
To like the shops and like go in like father daughter date type stuff because I've no seen him in a bit. Um

2171
02:42:56,840 --> 02:43:01,160
Um, I'm getting I'm gonna take me to a petting zoo. I think

2172
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:07,560
Uh praying there's like actually animals there or it's just going to be like a goat in a field with like one of those like

2173
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:10,600
Put 50 cents in here and turn the style and feed the animal

2174
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:14,760
Can your stream addiction handle the it's going to be really weird

2175
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:22,600
Because like in the most respectful way like I'm just so used to like talking all day long to you reeflings

2176
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:28,200
So the thought of being like, oh no, I'm actually time gated

2177
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:34,120
Like I I don't experience time gated like yesterday. I thought I was only going to stream for four hours

2178
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:38,120
It turned out to be nine because yeah, like I'm not time gated. Um

2179
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:43,080
Spend time with your dad. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for understanding. Um

2180
02:43:43,320 --> 02:43:45,320
I

2181
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:46,440
It's gonna be weird

2182
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:52,040
Like I need to pick out games that are short or games that can be done under eight hours because basically

2183
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:58,680
I want like if we do like four hours for the first stream then the other four to complete the game in the next one

2184
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:00,920
um

2185
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:02,920
Like it's gonna be weird

2186
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:06,360
You literally shoot him all the time. You think you're gonna accidentally talk to chat

2187
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:11,480
What like when I'm talking to my dad? No, I'm gonna like show my dad everything. I'm going like these are the reeflings

2188
02:44:11,480 --> 02:44:14,760
These are all the like fan arts that have made of me. Maybe not the other stuff

2189
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:19,960
Uh, this is like me and these are the girls and the girls will say hi and all that jazz

2190
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:25,320
Let's call the jury campaigns. We're pretty short. Oh, maybe maybe

2191
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:30,120
Make sure you pay a sheebie and a fondle in person for us

2192
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:38,440
I didn't realize if someone gifts mercy member like if someone does membership gifts on mercy stream

2193
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:43,160
The audio queue is me screaming fondle opism

2194
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:47,080
I like mercy. Where did you even grab that from?

2195
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:52,680
So, yeah, if you ever wanted to know what happens if you gift a membership on mercy stream

2196
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:54,760
It's just me going fondle opism

2197
02:44:55,480 --> 02:44:56,440
Like

2198
02:44:56,440 --> 02:45:00,600
She yanked I had no idea she did that. I must have tickled her pink

2199
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:06,760
I didn't it tickled everyone pink. I didn't think the name was that bad. I thought it was funny

2200
02:45:07,720 --> 02:45:12,760
Like oh, you're going to remember if a vtuber comes out and calls themselves fondle a bosom or you know, like

2201
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:18,200
If I can only stream for four hours and who's going to yap to the reeflings for the other five

2202
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:24,360
Literally, I'm like veal or girls girls besties. You're going to need to step up the reeflings are going to be uh needing

2203
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:26,120
A yap off

2204
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:30,200
Okay, you all start better start yapping about your special interests to put them asleep

2205
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:35,960
They the reeflings cannot go to sleep unless they've heard of either one a capitalist rant

2206
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:38,520
Two a rant about some random subject that

2207
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:42,120
Reminded me of something because someone mentioned something really obtuse

2208
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:48,600
Um or some sort of like video game relation thing. Okay, so girls get on it. Uh, I'm sure they'll do just fine

2209
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:51,160
um

2210
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:54,360
Yes, it's terrible, but it's absolutely hilarious. She's a memer too, you know

2211
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:57,240
listen first is a

2212
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:00,120
Family first, but you're my family reefling

2213
02:46:01,320 --> 02:46:04,120
It feels it feels horrible being pulled apart

2214
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:06,440
like but

2215
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:09,080
Still four hours. I think is more than adequate

2216
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:11,080
Hopefully

2217
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:16,840
Hopefully I don't have reefing I'm coping on now. There are times I will see what my dad's wanting to because there'll be days where

2218
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,360
We don't go out and do anything. So I might be able to squeeze in a cheeky endurance here and there

2219
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:26,120
um

2220
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:28,120
But I'll probably have to

2221
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:33,160
Go and like talk to him or like five minute intervals at like every hour or something

2222
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:38,280
Just so he's just so I'm I'm still here dad. I'm still here. I'm just yapping away

2223
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:40,200
uh

2224
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:46,280
Him listening to the absolute ridiculous conversations we get up to he'll be like what's been sest

2225
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,840
What is bindo about you don't want to know dad? You don't want to know

2226
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:53,480
So

2227
02:46:55,080 --> 02:47:00,200
I say that as if my dad isn't uh doesn't know about internet culture to be honest. So it doesn't really matter

2228
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:02,600
It doesn't matter in the end. Um

2229
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:06,360
We need every five minutes of your dad because we need to thank him. Oh, no

2230
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:10,920
He's like insert legal name here and legal address kind of uh parent

2231
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:17,000
So yeah, no not happening. Um, he might knock on door. He told me I was um

2232
02:47:17,720 --> 02:47:20,120
What's that talking to him a wee bit ago?

2233
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:24,440
Um, and he was like I might bang on the door just so you know, I'm awake and I'm like great

2234
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:28,680
So I get to have a heart attack and freak out. Sure. Give him a patreon subs

2235
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:33,400
Meet that refund right there meet that refund right there. No

2236
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:35,640
um

2237
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:41,720
No, he didn't he doesn't he doesn't know those kind of no, then he knows that um, you know a voice slag

2238
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:48,520
Um and all that but no, uh, he no no, you know, you know, no none of that none of that

2239
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:54,840
Uh, no, not that kind of path. No, he's not a step dad. Um, put it that way. He's not step dad. He's he's mad at

2240
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:56,440
mad at

2241
02:47:56,440 --> 02:48:02,520
Um, but yes, I need to think of like shorter games. I think stray is probably going to be on the roster

2242
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:04,920
Um

2243
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:09,800
You're wrong for that one chief. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna you're you kind of wrong for that one

2244
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:13,720
Um, like actual dad, but not a dad. I like I see

2245
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:19,000
Hope we get are you winning strongy? Oh, do you want him to do voice lines just for the hell of it?

2246
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:26,680
I was gonna see if I can do that halo playthrough with them, but I don't know if it's possible because

2247
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:30,520
Um

2248
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:33,880
It's take it. I don't know if I could set them up on it or not

2249
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:37,080
I might just do like the classic interview

2250
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:41,000
Thing like if you guys have any questions for my dad because I'm sure when I was going to be like

2251
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:46,040
What was it like that your daughter's a slag and then he goes well the house is paid off and I get to retire next year

2252
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:51,000
So feels pretty good. And then it's like, oh, everyone gets rolled in smoke that has ever said anything nasty

2253
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:58,840
Um make it a video. Yes. I thought about doing like an interview video where it's like because vtubers make it such a big deal

2254
02:48:59,480 --> 02:49:01,480
My parents know I'm a vtuber

2255
02:49:03,320 --> 02:49:05,320
Like

2256
02:49:05,320 --> 02:49:10,040
Would they not know that you work at Tescos as well? Am I missing some key elemental factor?

2257
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:13,640
Do your parents like not just you know

2258
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:21,000
Do your parents not root for you and everything you do like are they not in your corner being like? Yeah, that's amazing. Go strongy go

2259
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:23,880
No

2260
02:49:23,960 --> 02:49:26,920
Well, that's what I have anyway, so it's not it's never been like a

2261
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:34,120
Oh my god, my parents don't know what I'm doing. Please don't tell it. Well, of course my parents know what I'm doing

2262
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:36,120
I'm having a fucking carry on

2263
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:40,520
Do you think if you think I can't stop yam to you guys I'd be telling everything

2264
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:43,400
My parents know every little detail

2265
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:48,120
Well, I tell you a secret

2266
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:52,600
A strongy mama strongy like she be

2267
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:56,760
I

2268
02:49:58,360 --> 02:50:00,360
Mama strongy is a harem

2269
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:02,120
and

2270
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:06,200
She really likes her voice and she finds her voice quite soothing

2271
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:09,720
And she's like oh, she has a really good voice really good voice. Yeah

2272
02:50:11,080 --> 02:50:12,840
um

2273
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:19,400
She got on at me about emi's chest, so I don't talk to emi about I don't talk about emi to her

2274
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:25,080
Because she was like a strongy. I'm no sure about that and I'm like look mom

2275
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:28,520
Mom you have to understand

2276
02:50:28,680 --> 02:50:31,640
Peytan is in Peytan stonks are in

2277
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:34,520
What does dad think about she be?

2278
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,720
I don't think dad really has much of an opinion. He doesn't really say much

2279
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:43,000
He like knows everyone's designs. I tell you what I'll get him to record his reaction to the designs

2280
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,480
I could probably do that in the interview type thing with him

2281
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:51,160
And be like because I've told them countless times. I'm called strongy

2282
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:52,840
He knows I'm called strongy

2283
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:57,960
And I know for a fact if I sit him down and record and be like name this feature bar he'll go

2284
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:00,760
um

2285
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:01,960
Oh

2286
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:03,960
And he can't come out of them

2287
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:09,560
strongy's mum's a hates flies. No, she doesn't hate that she's flat

2288
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:12,760
She dislikes the

2289
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:15,480
Young girl appearance

2290
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:19,800
Um of emi and she thought it was a bit messed up and I'm like like I can see it

2291
02:51:19,800 --> 02:51:24,840
But I've been staring at icing emi for over a year now. It's just thing. I like it doesn't mean anything

2292
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:29,320
Like I tried to be like well, it's just the opposite of a cleavage really

2293
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:33,320
It's just a concave chest because she's got nothing there and mum was named

2294
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:39,560
She was kind of seeing it and she was kind of no seeing it and she was like right as long as yous are all safe and happy

2295
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:43,400
That's all she's as long as yous are all safe and happy. That's my mum

2296
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:47,160
The fact that it's a lollipop I

2297
02:51:47,960 --> 02:51:49,960
aim my mum's

2298
02:51:50,120 --> 02:51:54,120
Experience with like japanese and anime and that I forced her to watch kill the kill with me

2299
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:58,920
Which has a lot of fan service and she was like strongy. What is this fish and I'm like honestly

2300
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:03,640
It is actually quite embarrassing watching anime in front of your parents. So don't recommend that

2301
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:06,360
Oh

2302
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:13,080
Lollipop love everyone involved is an adult the end end of story. Yes, everyone is safe. Everyone is happy everyone

2303
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:17,960
Ah, yes, yeah kill kill son. I love kill kill

2304
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:23,080
There's a very good video game and kill kill

2305
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:27,800
I uh a fan game

2306
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:31,640
A fan game of kill kill

2307
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:35,080
And it is it is insane quality

2308
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:40,760
It's not a fighting game. No, um, we're a bit tied up in the game

2309
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:47,000
Is it by zone it might be because the quality was off the charts of the game

2310
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:52,600
Like honestly like something the development team for the anime made themselves. I was like good. Oh, I know that one

2311
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:59,560
I used to go absolutely nuts for that. I cannot have countless times. I have spilled my ink to it

2312
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:01,960
It is a fantastic game

2313
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:08,040
Um, it's outrageous. I know but I don't care

2314
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:17,560
Fun fact, bible black was my introduction. Have I seen that? I don't think I have

2315
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:21,080
My dad likes to watch anime with me sometimes the one he likes the most

2316
02:53:21,640 --> 02:53:25,640
Was his high school at the dead. I wonder why oh, no, is it bad?

2317
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:31,400
Gaming bless your heart. I'm trying. I'm trying

2318
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:35,800
Oh, I know you mean gaming isn't it?

2319
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:43,000
Do you see yourself playing on elsewhere? Yeah. Um, there's this orc game that I'm absolutely tantalized by that

2320
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:46,280
I've never played it. I absolutely want to do like a

2321
02:53:47,400 --> 02:53:53,000
Type of like live like we play it and do stuff together live type of stream

2322
02:53:53,800 --> 02:53:55,560
um

2323
02:53:56,600 --> 02:54:00,760
Uh, my only issue

2324
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:06,360
I wanted it to be free

2325
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,400
But someone raised the issue

2326
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:22,040
That having it accessible like that negates the audios and I'm like, oh, well I kind of agree

2327
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:26,920
Which is a bit shitty. I don't know what the solution is to that situation is

2328
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:33,240
I don't have a solution yet. I still have time july is kind of when it you know things start to break

2329
02:54:34,840 --> 02:54:40,440
What do you mean by that? Um, so patreon's appeal is because you get very unique audios of scenarios

2330
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:43,320
um

2331
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:46,600
But I really don't want another subscription

2332
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:49,160
I

2333
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:53,080
Um, I don't want to charge anymore

2334
02:54:53,640 --> 02:54:58,440
Because the fucking membership was one dollar more than I wanted it to be so I'm already raging at that

2335
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:02,920
And I don't have a solution yet. I don't have a

2336
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:06,040
How does it negate it?

2337
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:08,680
Because it's like here's free access

2338
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:11,320
to this content

2339
02:55:11,320 --> 02:55:14,280
That arguably could be a lot better

2340
02:55:15,240 --> 02:55:19,720
Um, because some people aren't into the audios for like the rp aspect

2341
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:23,480
And it's like well, you can

2342
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:25,480
you know

2343
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:31,080
It's uh, it's a bit tricky to navigate at this stage. I don't have a solution

2344
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:34,280
I don't have a

2345
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:36,280
finality either

2346
02:55:36,360 --> 02:55:38,360
I

2347
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:40,600
Cheap vods via subscription

2348
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:46,440
Now vauding I might agree to a very small even if it's like a dollar

2349
02:55:46,520 --> 02:55:50,360
I kid you not a dollar for vods. I think is agreeable

2350
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,760
For the actual live stream. I think all you would have to do is follow

2351
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:59,080
And that's it. I'm quite happy with that solution. That might be the solution

2352
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:02,120
A dollar for vod access

2353
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:05,640
I think is fair

2354
02:56:06,040 --> 02:56:10,120
And then free access to the actual live if you can get it in time

2355
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:14,120
If it's all strong even that punishes people that have worked that punishes people in this time

2356
02:56:15,480 --> 02:56:17,240
Rob

2357
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:22,680
Look at any other agency and be like, are you getting value for money compared to us? Yes or no

2358
02:56:23,560 --> 02:56:28,760
Please I am trying. I'm trying to make everyone happy. It is not possible. Please work with me

2359
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:35,080
Work with me. These girls need to move out. These girls need to eat these girls need to find success these girls

2360
02:56:35,480 --> 02:56:36,760
You know

2361
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:38,760
Fucking give them your money

2362
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:46,520
Be nice to the girls. They're trying to achieve stuff. Okay. I've already got everything I need with my wiflings. Okay

2363
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:55,960
You'll be to watch small fee votes is a pretty common setup. Okay

2364
02:56:57,880 --> 02:57:01,960
There's no perfect solution, but that is one. Yes, there is no perfect solution

2365
02:57:02,360 --> 02:57:04,840
In the wise words of captain

2366
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:12,120
I cannot remember his name of the star chick enterprise

2367
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:19,160
Captain Picard you can do everything right and still it goes wrong or something like that. I can't remember

2368
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:25,800
I don't see if it will affect patreon stuff. Okay. Well, hopefully it doesn't if it does then

2369
02:57:26,360 --> 02:57:27,560
I

2370
02:57:27,560 --> 02:57:32,200
Because um patron if you didn't know uh if you ever feel but oh, it's only five dollars

2371
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:38,680
And patreon statistically and very shortly should and will be the girl's biggest income source

2372
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,040
Um very quickly. So don't be afraid to support mom patreon

2373
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:48,840
Uh undercut in the market undercut the market five dollars for four audios undercut in the market as well as access and archive to anything

2374
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:50,840
They produce on youtube. Yeah

2375
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:53,720
Okay

2376
02:57:54,040 --> 02:57:59,880
Undercut the market. Um, yes, it should actually be their biggest income source. Um, that's the plan anyway

2377
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:02,040
It looks like it's actually happening. You know that

2378
02:58:02,840 --> 02:58:04,040
and

2379
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:07,560
I can only speak for myself at this point

2380
02:58:09,560 --> 02:58:11,560
But

2381
02:58:11,560 --> 02:58:13,560
Yeah, my harry on

2382
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:19,960
Are you kidding me right now hit by the pope. I wanted to stay up for your stream since it starts at 2 a.m

2383
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:26,440
Here, but I ended up heaping out of comfort of your voice. Thank you for rambling. Thank you flaws for the super chat

2384
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:32,520
Are you got floppy as your profile picture? That's floppy, isn't it? It is. Um

2385
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:38,200
Thank you for the super chat and uh, please rest well unless you're up already

2386
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:40,600
You tried to stay up for the stream but passed out

2387
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:42,200
Oh

2388
02:58:42,200 --> 02:58:44,200
We've got a thousand wines bomb

2389
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:49,960
Flop a little big flop like who's gonna go. Hmm. Now that this free. I don't want to sell up on patreon hard

2390
02:58:50,600 --> 02:58:52,600
You'd be surprised. Um

2391
02:58:53,640 --> 02:58:57,400
Some of the patreon feedback is like that shit insane

2392
02:58:57,480 --> 02:59:02,040
I could probably talk about it a bit more as time develops. I might even make a short out of it, honestly

2393
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:04,840
um, you would be surprised how

2394
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:11,720
People's like exit survey you can leave it if you leave someone's patreon. You can leave a message and it's like an exit survey

2395
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:14,680
You would be surprised on the reasons

2396
02:59:15,400 --> 02:59:18,680
Why someone is like i'm no longer supporting you type thing

2397
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:22,440
My biggest problem is if I want to watch all the girls

2398
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:27,560
I don't have time to have to make sacrifices that I don't yet know if I am ready to make

2399
02:59:28,440 --> 02:59:30,600
Oh, thank you our own reaper

2400
02:59:31,400 --> 02:59:33,880
for the five and um

2401
02:59:35,800 --> 02:59:37,800
Yeah the

2402
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:45,000
Yeah, it's kind of hard to keep up with all the girls at once. Uh, definitely not that easy. Um

2403
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:49,400
But what was I saying? I've completely forgotten. No

2404
02:59:50,760 --> 02:59:56,040
My brain's too small to do multiple things at once. Can I give an example an example of what i'm so sorry

2405
02:59:56,040 --> 02:59:58,040
I've completely forgotten what I was talking about

2406
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:00,920
um

2407
03:00:01,160 --> 03:00:03,160
I

2408
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:08,200
Hearing the girls are really happy about how they are doing. Hopefully they can all make their situation better. Yeah, like I think

2409
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:13,800
Emmy's want to move out. Aces want to move out. Azura's want to move out. Shuby's want to move out. Everyone's want to move out

2410
03:00:15,560 --> 03:00:17,560
Uh mercy wants to move out because

2411
03:00:18,680 --> 03:00:20,680
Her parents make it a nightmare to record

2412
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:24,120
I'm not even I'm not even gonna pretend

2413
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:26,840
It should be like oh my parents are up. Sorry

2414
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:31,160
No, that's fine. That's fine. Just leave it. Leave it last minute. It's fine. It doesn't make a difference

2415
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:33,800
Oh crazy

2416
03:00:33,800 --> 03:00:39,320
Patreon feedback. Uh, yeah stuff like uh no longer want to support because

2417
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:42,200
um

2418
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:46,280
You made this one audio that I don't enjoy and it's like

2419
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:51,080
Now don't get me wrong

2420
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:53,400
Please don't ever feel forced to like throw your money at

2421
03:00:53,960 --> 03:00:56,120
Creators if you genuinely don't enjoy what they put out

2422
03:00:56,440 --> 03:01:02,600
But some of the stuff is like you made one audio. I do not like out of so many audios that you have made

2423
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:04,840
I am gone and it was like, okay

2424
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:10,120
Why would you even leave that in the feedback like don't be realistic? I don't know if it like you need to be told to your face

2425
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:14,680
There's no way in heck one creator can make something that you enjoy a hundred percent of the time

2426
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:21,880
Like as soon as I come out saying that I didn't mind sounding. Oh, oh, strongy bad. Oh, right. That's it. Get it out right now

2427
03:01:21,960 --> 03:01:24,440
I've got straw. Um

2428
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:27,800
I'm teasing I'm teasing

2429
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:36,040
Uh five minutes and 56 seconds into the audio you made a mouth sound. I did not like honestly it can be like that

2430
03:01:36,520 --> 03:01:40,520
Um, I'll definitely show some examples strongy's a bad girl

2431
03:01:42,680 --> 03:01:46,840
Who made you listen to that audio like come on. Yes, it definitely feels a bit like

2432
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:48,440
I

2433
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:51,320
Don't know if people feel forced to put something

2434
03:01:51,480 --> 03:01:55,400
I don't know how it looks when you like disengage from someone's patreon subscription

2435
03:01:55,880 --> 03:01:58,920
But I don't know if people feel forced to put an answer down

2436
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:04,440
You do not have to put an answer down and insult the creator on the way out just uh, just a quick tip for you

2437
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:06,760
You know, you don't have to insult the creator on the way out

2438
03:02:06,760 --> 03:02:10,680
Even though like you literally put your money where your mouth was and supported the creator like is

2439
03:02:11,240 --> 03:02:15,960
I will definitely make a short about it and show some examples because it's uh rather humorous

2440
03:02:16,040 --> 03:02:18,040
It can be rather humorous

2441
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:23,640
Or when they make an assumption about everything you'll make in the future off of two posts

2442
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:26,360
Bruh, I felt so bad for she be

2443
03:02:28,520 --> 03:02:36,040
I felt so bad for she be she was getting a bit of flak because the first audio just happened to be an s scenario

2444
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:39,480
And she made three

2445
03:02:39,640 --> 03:02:43,960
d scenarios and one s and it was voted on the one s

2446
03:02:44,840 --> 03:02:49,800
And she got so much flak and I'm like do I have to like come out and explain like how this works?

2447
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:52,040
like

2448
03:02:52,040 --> 03:02:57,880
I am I am happy to say we do have a schedule that will be posted next month

2449
03:02:58,760 --> 03:03:00,760
Where you can see what's coming up ahead

2450
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:03,800
So um, if you are on a monthly

2451
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:06,360
basis like you

2452
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:09,960
You sign up and then sign off again. You'll be able to see what's coming up

2453
03:03:09,960 --> 03:03:14,520
I will try my best to put the tags, but I'm absolutely rubbish at making tags. I'm not used to it

2454
03:03:15,720 --> 03:03:21,880
So it's hard to get used to it because I'm struggling me. I'm struggling. I'm not smart enough for this

2455
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:28,200
Okay, when this pops we're going to make a cup of tea and get some food in our belly because I'm getting a bit hungry

2456
03:03:29,240 --> 03:03:34,680
Yeah, I think that would have changed the results. There is going to be that first plot d

2457
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:36,600
scenario

2458
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:37,640
I

2459
03:03:37,640 --> 03:03:45,080
I just I didn't write it at the time because I at the point I had actually wrote 3d for her

2460
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:47,640
And then I was like, okay

2461
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:54,840
She needs one s at least and somehow you guys miraculously voted on the one s. I was literally the odds were what one in four

2462
03:03:56,040 --> 03:03:59,320
But anyway, I thought it was really funny her first audio was sd

2463
03:04:00,600 --> 03:04:02,600
I mean you do have to remember

2464
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:06,040
Am I allowed to say that?

2465
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:08,040
No, maybe no

2466
03:04:08,840 --> 03:04:12,440
Maybe another time. Have you thought about posting demos? Um

2467
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:20,600
No, um, I actually no, I don't mean this in a bad way. Please do not think I'm

2468
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:23,720
83

2469
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:25,560
That's fantastic

2470
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:31,320
Um, please do not think I am honing in on your comment. Um, even though I am responding to your question though

2471
03:04:32,280 --> 03:04:34,280
I do not believe

2472
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:39,800
In the need this sounds terrible and I hope it doesn't come across as bad as it sounds

2473
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:44,840
I don't think a preview is needed for such a low

2474
03:04:46,120 --> 03:04:53,800
Undercut of the market as well as you can try it for for you can trial it for five dollars

2475
03:04:55,320 --> 03:04:58,360
You can trial it. You don't have to keep it on afterwards

2476
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:00,760
um

2477
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:09,800
I do under like and the girls already post stuff for free on the alt twitter like I feel like you get enough of a

2478
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Situation of is this going to be worth it or not? And if it's not worth it

2479
03:05:15,560 --> 03:05:21,320
Hopefully that fight, you know, you're not going to spend five dollars that you actually need like so

2480
03:05:21,800 --> 03:05:23,560
It's kind of like

2481
03:05:23,560 --> 03:05:25,080
It's not even a lose

2482
03:05:25,080 --> 03:05:30,440
There's like no loss as well because you've actually directly supported the girl like that you've helped them like

2483
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:35,960
Move out. You've helped them maybe upgrade their equipment that um, they didn't want to ask management for

2484
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:38,440
isura

2485
03:05:38,440 --> 03:05:43,720
Per isura. She was too shy to ask for a new iphone. So I had to buy her one like right before debut

2486
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:46,920
um

2487
03:05:47,080 --> 03:05:50,600
But she got it so our iphone's all juicy as far as i'm aware

2488
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:57,880
Is there a no yeah, it just seemed like there's a lot of extremes for the first people

2489
03:05:58,600 --> 03:06:00,360
and

2490
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:02,600
I

2491
03:06:02,600 --> 03:06:04,600
Actually can't make a comment

2492
03:06:08,600 --> 03:06:11,800
I mean the first the first month is always chaos. Um

2493
03:06:12,760 --> 03:06:17,480
People getting used to folk folk filtering themselves folk getting filtered like it's just the way it is

2494
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:20,760
Um, but like once things settle down, I mean

2495
03:06:21,400 --> 03:06:24,520
I mean she I think I was in the the reef lines are all settled down

2496
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:29,480
Are we not like we're already jumping straight into endurance stream. We've got elden ring next week. Hello. No

2497
03:06:29,720 --> 03:06:32,040
We've got elden ring in a couple of days like hello

2498
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:37,480

I will absolutely like I feel like we're we're settled and you guys already know where the start score is with me

2501
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:49,640
Um, you know, you have to let the girls cook a little bit, you know, let them get comfy and all that jazz

2502
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:56,360
You're gonna catch she be stream. Oh she'd be live anything for any harem members. Sheepster's live mercy collab

Uh, see you in the mercy collab. Yes, I will see you in the mercy club. Thank you for the tip. Bye

2504
03:07:02,200 --> 03:07:08,840
Um, please do watch emmy is collabing with uh a person's name that I forget right now

2505
03:07:09,880 --> 03:07:16,280
Unfortunately, and she be is live with inscription if you enjoy inscription. Yes, the elden ring dlc is coming out. Um

2506
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,240
I bloody hope I've done it on the right day

2507
03:07:19,880 --> 03:07:28,120
I will download the dlc. We are starting a fresh save. Um, I don't know if it's one of those things where you can

2508
03:07:29,240 --> 03:07:35,720
Just run to the dlc area. I mean, maybe if it's appropriate or unless it's like harder than kaolin type thing

2509
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:40,440
Can't wait to play elden ring. It's out today

2510
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:46,040
That I purposely push it a day back is elden ring tomorrow

2511
03:07:46,280 --> 03:07:48,280
Eaps

2512
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:52,200
Oh, no, I don't want ashes

2513
03:07:54,440 --> 03:07:56,440
Elden ring today

2514
03:07:56,520 --> 03:07:59,160
Show me my youtube channel so I can look at my own

2515
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:02,280
Um

2516
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:04,280
So I can look at my own

2517
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:09,160
Schedule all children. Yeah, elden rings tomorrow. I'm heart rate monitor and all that. Yeah

2518
03:08:12,200 --> 03:08:15,400
Elden ring dlc unlocks in like two hours. Yes, make sure you

2519
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:18,120
purchase

2520
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:22,200
Um, yeah, don't be surprised

2521
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:29,560
Um, when you see a ton of vtuber's playing elden ring, I think all of us are about to go fucking mental for it

2522
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:36,920
Man, it breaks my heart. Strone's providing so much literally and figure out the quality and quantity why sometimes even for free

2523
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:38,920
And some people are still asking for more

2524
03:08:38,920 --> 03:08:45,480
Uh, it's human nature to want more. It's fine. I understand how it works. Like there's no point in being like, you know mad

2525
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:48,040
um

2526
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:53,320
Like you can only do so much and um, you know, you know, you're in yourself your limitations

2527
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:58,440
Like I wouldn't push myself to like have a silly goal of like one asmr video pair

2528
03:08:59,240 --> 03:09:03,240
A 1000 subs type thing is the most dangerous of all the girls

2529
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:07,320
She sounds so sweet and innocent and then you look at her patreon

2530
03:09:07,320 --> 03:09:12,920
And I feel like I should report myself to the police. What steady on I wrote her plots

2531
03:09:13,880 --> 03:09:19,080
Uh, I will say they're they're my plots. I've been written for roughly two to three months

2532
03:09:19,080 --> 03:09:21,080
Some of them are actually only two months

2533
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:26,200
Uh, and then the scriptmaster comes in and I think the scriptmaster will just work as far better than mine

2534
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:29,800
Um, so I think you'll like them a heck of a lot more

2535
03:09:30,440 --> 03:09:36,600
Which reminds me I actually need to send off an editing batch away because me completed her july audio space

2536
03:09:38,440 --> 03:09:40,680
Shawnee you're maoshi, but I do love all the girls and care about them

2537
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:47,880
I want all of yours to be happy. Yes. I want them to be happy too. It's um, it's very interesting some some um

2538
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:52,280
I you know

2539
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:54,440
I thought it was a pretty

2540
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:59,480
Honestly, it just feels like I've spawned in another five strongies and you know reeflings

2541
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:02,200
If that makes sense like, you know

2542
03:10:02,200 --> 03:10:03,640
Mercy snippets

2543
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:07,640
Strongly reeflings like it feels like I've just spawned in another five that just do their own thing and have a good time

2544
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:10,200
And I mean that's what it's all about at the end of the day

2545
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:12,520
I don't think it's you know

2546
03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:14,520
Fucking chasing numbers and oh my god

2547
03:10:15,160 --> 03:10:18,280
Must must must have this must do this must do that and it's like no, I really have fun

2548
03:10:18,280 --> 03:10:23,480
Like I get to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey, I'd love to do ASMR with you

2549
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:29,080
I'll write the script. It's like a fun little small goofy thing. You know no stress no fuss like it lets me

2550
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:35,080
You know interact with people in the vtuber community like it's it's like such a little blessing. Um

2551
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:37,320
I mean like our

2552
03:10:37,320 --> 03:10:44,120
Holy shit. I get to claim that this is work. I get to claim that sitting in edgeville on world three eight right now

2553
03:10:44,600 --> 03:10:46,280
uh doing wine

2554
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:51,720
Uh talking to reeflings is work in quotation marks like nah nah the same work

2555
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:59,000
Less like a corporal more of a guild of indies honestly, it's probably a more accurate thingy. Um

2556
03:10:59,720 --> 03:11:04,280
Just that there was a lot of massive money back in to be honest. Um

2557
03:11:05,240 --> 03:11:08,440
Yes, I'm going to try and get the girls at least 5k subscribers this

2558
03:11:08,840 --> 03:11:14,200
Month, so I'm going to send Icy and Azura an ASMR. I'm going to get Azura to do heartbeat ASMR

2559
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:16,920
and kissing

2560
03:11:16,920 --> 03:11:22,120
Maybe not kissing because I actually saw an ASMRist got their video removed for kissing

2561
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:30,840
I think Azura sleep aids heartbeat cuddle sound soft breathing would go very well

2562
03:11:31,160 --> 03:11:35,720
She be actually has a sleep aid audio coming out. I ordered the artwork

2563
03:11:36,760 --> 03:11:41,800
Um, and it's already here and I need to edit and get it ready to click send

2564
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,560
What do you mean? I'm doing far too much

2565
03:11:46,360 --> 03:11:50,200
Work all at once. What are you talking about? No, not the kissing. Yeah, I don't know

2566
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:56,200
No, so you can do like soft breathing, but for some reason if you've got a 3d or you can't go up in the ear

2567
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:01,640
Make it make sense. Like I I've no got clue. Make it make sense. Thank you again iron reaper for the tip

2568
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:05,400
I'm pretty sure I didn't read your name out because we were all thinking about how evil emmy is

2569
03:12:05,560 --> 03:12:07,560
But emmy's a good kind of evil

2570
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
Um, oh my tummy is rumbling

2571
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:15,720
I can't believe it. I may actually my human body needs to eat and hydrate

2572
03:12:17,240 --> 03:12:20,600
Um, do you have a sleep aid audio coming out? Yes, I

2573
03:12:20,760 --> 03:12:23,400
Haven't made it. I haven't written it

2574
03:12:23,880 --> 03:12:27,800
But if there's anything you want in a sleep aid audio, let me know

2575
03:12:28,840 --> 03:12:33,400
Um, I was probably just going to do the old classic route. Is there a cat in this room?

2576
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:38,520
Vigo

2577
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:40,920
I'm losing it

2578
03:12:41,080 --> 03:12:44,120
I'm so dehydrated. I'm losing it and I think Vigo's in the room right now

2579
03:12:44,680 --> 03:12:49,960
Uh, I might have to start making a lot of the sus ASMR member only

2580
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:57,480
Hmm

2581
03:12:57,480 --> 03:13:01,720
I don't want to overwhelm the girls. Um with work requirements

2582
03:13:02,520 --> 03:13:08,760
Um, like for me, you know streaming doing three member streaming weekend streaming every day is not problem

2583
03:13:08,840 --> 03:13:12,040
But I am aware that people have limitations

2584
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:14,120
that I don't

2585
03:13:14,120 --> 03:13:15,800
um

2586
03:13:15,800 --> 03:13:17,800
And they experience things that I don't

2587
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:20,120
um

2588
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:24,200
So it makes it kind of like not a dangerous playing field

2589
03:13:24,360 --> 03:13:32,120
But like I try to make things as super easy and simple like that ASMR. I got she be to talk to make sorry

2590
03:13:32,360 --> 03:13:34,200
um

2591
03:13:34,200 --> 03:13:39,800
I think it was like less than five minutes of dialogue and I know people might be like, oh my god

2592
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:42,280
Why aren't you giving us a massive amount of dialogue?

2593
03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:47,560
And it was like I need to manage the girl's stress levels like needy streamer overload

2594
03:13:47,640 --> 03:13:51,640
I cannot overload them with work whilst they're trying to stream

2595
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:57,320
I'm trying to entertain because they might struggle with things that I don't experience because I don't feel uncomfortable

2596
03:13:57,480 --> 03:14:00,520
Or like I just feel literally right at home. Um

2597
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:07,480
But humble brag. No, I'm not even like in a mean way. I just like I need to be so careful and so cautious

2598
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:10,600
And like it's scary because like

2599
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:15,240
It's not like the girls have a hp bar and a stress bar that I can look at

2600
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:20,280
And be like, are you telling me the truth? Like I was checked in on emmy and emmy's like, I'm fine

2601
03:14:20,360 --> 03:14:24,440
I'm cloud nine. I was like pinky promise me right now because I I don't know

2602
03:14:24,600 --> 03:14:28,200
I actually don't know if you're good, but I think emmy is good and she was good and all that, you know

2603
03:14:29,080 --> 03:14:32,520
Like if the girls had freaking hp bars and stress bars

2604
03:14:32,520 --> 03:14:35,080
I would be a lot easier to navigate what I want them to do

2605
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:40,920
But like at the moment I'm having to be like patient and let them settle and like they've taken break days

2606
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:44,600
And maybe on break days they'll record the youtube ASMR's for me like

2607
03:14:45,240 --> 03:14:47,080
It's um

2608
03:14:47,080 --> 03:14:50,920
And who's thinking about you the reeflings are thinking about me silly

2609
03:14:52,360 --> 03:14:55,320
The reeflings give me energy the reeflings give me life

2610
03:14:55,960 --> 03:14:57,960
Hmm

2611
03:14:58,600 --> 03:15:04,440
Literally I rolled out of bed 10 minutes before stream. I was moody. I made a cup of tea

2612
03:15:05,240 --> 03:15:12,200
Um, I got set up the moment I come on live. I go in a massive round in rave. You guys fill me with with energy

2613
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:16,360
With determination. I've been filled with your determination

2614
03:15:17,640 --> 03:15:18,600
Um

2615
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:23,720
Like yeah, you don't you don't you don't all worry about me. I get life like when you guys comment

2616
03:15:23,720 --> 03:15:28,680
Oh, your ASMR was so cute. All the stream was so cute. I'm a vod watcher. Here's a clip like

2617
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:33,800
Uh fun facts Johnny. We love you. Love you to replay

2618
03:15:34,680 --> 03:15:39,400
If they had hp bars emmy's would enjoy if hers was low munkos

2619
03:15:41,400 --> 03:15:45,400
Uh, I would actually mess around with the idea of a feature management game

2620
03:15:45,400 --> 03:15:49,160
I think that's very on topic, but uh, I don't have the development team

2621
03:15:49,240 --> 03:15:52,600
I don't have a development team at all for video games, but I do have the funds

2622
03:15:53,080 --> 03:15:57,160
But I would have to write out the game and I don't have time to write out the game right now

2623
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,640
I wrote out the bare bones of my cookie clicker game

2624
03:16:02,600 --> 03:16:04,200
um

2625
03:16:04,200 --> 03:16:06,760
Totally not inspired by legend of zelda by the way, uh

2626
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:10,680
Yeah, I do not have time to write video games

2627
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:14,920
Which is annoying because it's one of the projects I'm gonna do as that what the call the kids call it now

2628
03:16:14,920 --> 03:16:20,760
She steals our energy. He's like, he's real emmy's hp bar has an inverse relationship. We're a happy bar

2629
03:16:21,800 --> 03:16:27,240
Gen two game just saying oh, I already know what the gen two game is and the gen three game is I've already picked it out

2630
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:34,040
Um, I realized very quickly whilst I was commissioning the gen one game

2631
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:39,800
Oh wait games actually take a lot of money and time to produce. Um, so I already know what the

2632
03:16:40,760 --> 03:16:46,200
The gen two is uh free to play video game of an alternative nature is um

2633
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:50,920
I'd be very surprised if anyone would guess it's because

2634
03:16:53,080 --> 03:16:56,440
It's based on pre-established games, but we've

2635
03:16:57,960 --> 03:17:00,840
We've borneified it and you basically can

2636
03:17:01,720 --> 03:17:05,100
Swing with the girls in the generation in that game

2637
03:17:05,580 --> 03:17:07,100
I

2638
03:17:07,100 --> 03:17:09,100
Will go like

2639
03:17:09,180 --> 03:17:13,900
She's 10 steps ahead of us when I say it took a year for the girls to pop up

2640
03:17:13,980 --> 03:17:17,900
I wasn't kidding like you have to think ahead like you have to think of events

2641
03:17:17,900 --> 03:17:22,140
You have to think of their birthdays. You have to think of their doughnut thongs. You have to think of alternative outfits

2642
03:17:22,460 --> 03:17:23,820
You have to think

2643
03:17:23,820 --> 03:17:28,540
Right, uh, we've made the offer if they sign on another year. They can get another alternative outfit

2644
03:17:28,540 --> 03:17:32,460
All right, the girl's gonna want a group alternative outfit of a certain theme like

2645
03:17:33,020 --> 03:17:37,580
There's like a possibility of a timeline that next year in june

2646
03:17:38,540 --> 03:17:44,140
If we're all standing we might all have like goth variations of our designs something like that. Um

2647
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:50,060
Like there's a lot. Please not candy crush. No, it's not candy crush

2648
03:17:51,820 --> 03:17:53,660
You're welcome

2649
03:17:53,660 --> 03:18:00,940
Read and list bonus months. Yes, like we so the split is 80 20 and if they sign on another year that increases to

2650
03:18:01,260 --> 03:18:02,460
um

2651
03:18:02,460 --> 03:18:04,460
85 15

2652
03:18:05,100 --> 03:18:06,540
um

2653
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:09,420
And they also get an alternative costume

2654
03:18:10,460 --> 03:18:12,620
on the house by

2655
03:18:12,620 --> 03:18:14,620
Like the development team

2656
03:18:15,420 --> 03:18:19,420
But they can like dictate what all outfit they want. That's perfectly fine. We don't have an issue with that

2657
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:23,020
But we pay for it as I like thanks for signing on for another year. Yippee

2658
03:18:25,180 --> 03:18:28,060
Will it be a card game? No, there's not a card game

2659
03:18:28,780 --> 03:18:31,660
I actually can only remember the first two

2660
03:18:32,460 --> 03:18:34,220
um

2661
03:18:34,220 --> 03:18:36,220
The first two generations game

2662
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:39,260
type

2663
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:43,660
Based well, it'd be a mobile. No, it's a mobile. Are you joking me?

2664
03:18:45,020 --> 03:18:48,220
Hi, I just got home from working realize I missed sharing a smart any chance

2665
03:18:48,220 --> 03:18:55,820
It's currently on patreon at this moment in time. Um, I'm going to upload it to twitter

2666
03:18:56,540 --> 03:19:00,540
I need to buy twitter

2667
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:03,500
Oh, we popped. Yay

2668
03:19:04,380 --> 03:19:05,820
What are we?

2669
03:19:05,820 --> 03:19:10,780
We're 83. Wait, we may actually make 85. My prediction is true. I can't believe that

2670
03:19:11,500 --> 03:19:13,500
Wow, what's that? Yeah

2671
03:19:13,660 --> 03:19:20,300
Cuttles turns into a sea jargon just like pokemon evolution cleolix and animal. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good split. Yes, um

2672
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:25,100
because of the freedoms and how low is the

2673
03:19:25,980 --> 03:19:32,940
As I've said this before the actual upkeep the up. Yeah. Yeah, the upkeep the upkeep really ain't that much

2674
03:19:33,500 --> 03:19:37,180
Ain't that much at all? I don't know what to tell you. It does not cost that much. Um

2675
03:19:40,700 --> 03:19:46,700
Probably the biggest cost right now is clippers unironically sending away these clip edits to be made

2676
03:19:47,420 --> 03:19:48,460
um

2677
03:19:48,460 --> 03:19:51,340
I have three clippers for the girls and they all unanimously

2678
03:19:51,820 --> 03:19:55,740
Unanimously needed a break all roughly at the same time

2679
03:19:56,460 --> 03:20:02,380
Um, which has led me to seek out a clipper for my own strongy stuff at the moment

2680
03:20:03,020 --> 03:20:06,380
Uh, because I've completely abandoned like my youtube shorts

2681
03:20:06,700 --> 03:20:13,500
Um in favor of the girls at the moment. Um, shebe's shorts are currently all getting limited

2682
03:20:14,220 --> 03:20:17,980
So I can't promote her shorts. I can't put advertisement money into her shorts

2683
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:24,460
Um her praise short was supposed I was going to put money into for advertisement. I can't because she's got too much

2684
03:20:25,980 --> 03:20:31,180
About 1.8k wines. Oh god. I don't know if I'm gonna make it in this room. Um

2685
03:20:32,940 --> 03:20:34,940
But yeah, we we struggle

2686
03:20:37,180 --> 03:20:42,940
Remember to rest by the way you have a collab too. Yes. No, I am I am I'm going offline when

2687
03:20:43,820 --> 03:20:51,420
Uh, Azura comes on which gives me two hours rest, which is more than adequate. Um, I'm talking to mercy one hour before

2688
03:20:52,140 --> 03:20:53,660
the stream starts

2689
03:20:53,660 --> 03:20:55,900
um, and

2690
03:20:55,900 --> 03:21:01,020
I just wanted to get some cheeky runescaping in because there's a few levels. We uh, definitely need to get up

2691
03:21:01,980 --> 03:21:05,900
How do you work on their videos or what? Um, maybe like an edit and thumbnail

2692
03:21:06,700 --> 03:21:09,100
um, so I basically

2693
03:21:09,980 --> 03:21:11,020
um

2694
03:21:11,020 --> 03:21:13,660
Go through their clips and if I find something clippable

2695
03:21:13,900 --> 03:21:18,860
I will send it to an editor, but I've actually asked them to do that because I can't scour all their clips at once

2696
03:21:18,860 --> 03:21:20,860
It's not possible. Um

2697
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:28,300
But I have pre-made shorts I make of them that's like insider knowledge about the vtuber agency or insider vtuber stuff

2698
03:21:28,380 --> 03:21:32,060
Like mercy's shorts. Oh my god. I'm so sorry to expose mercy like this

2699
03:21:33,340 --> 03:21:36,140
Mercy never wrote any of her shorts. That's all me

2700
03:21:37,100 --> 03:21:42,380
The short about like senpai am I blonde did you look should I been blonde or like this is what goes wrong as a v

2701
03:21:42,380 --> 03:21:45,580
These are that's me. I'm sorry. It's all me

2702
03:21:47,100 --> 03:21:49,100
I'm telling her what to say

2703
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:56,140
Exposed called it. Yes. Um, but it's me. That's pulling the strings. It's me. That's wrote these scripts and

2704
03:21:56,700 --> 03:22:01,980
It's me piloting her mecca and sending it off to the editor because I don't want to stress the talents out

2705
03:22:02,380 --> 03:22:09,420
With like having to do all these bits and bobs in between streaming. It's not good for it to reduce their stress as much as possible

2706
03:22:09,580 --> 03:22:11,100
I'm like

2707
03:22:11,100 --> 03:22:16,140
Putting it on me because I can handle these stress levels. Like I don't even feel stress

2708
03:22:16,540 --> 03:22:22,940
You know what I feel frustrated that I've let the girls down with a short scenario, but it's slowly evening out like what we're

2709
03:22:23,980 --> 03:22:28,060
I think I'm probably gonna try and see if I can find another editor to have on standby

2710
03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:30,460
because

2711
03:22:30,460 --> 03:22:34,220
We've got someone that skill isn't quite there yet and I'm like

2712
03:22:34,540 --> 03:22:38,940
I've need to pay the big bucks to get the edits. I want a new pair. You're such a hard-working beast

2713
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:41,500
Stroney is actually all a veeler

2714
03:22:42,860 --> 03:22:46,620
Yeah, I wasn't kidding when I said I was icy snow paws

2715
03:22:47,420 --> 03:22:50,620
Fuck I can't do our accent right now because I'm smiling

2716
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:53,340
I'm doing the most stereotypical accent

2717
03:22:54,300 --> 03:23:00,140
Dada, do you like my photos on twitter at twitter.com slash

2718
03:23:01,100 --> 03:23:03,100

Wow, yeah, like I can't do mersey's voice. I can't do emmy

2724
03:23:24,060 --> 03:23:27,420

2725
03:23:29,260 --> 03:23:31,260
Okay, sorry

03:23:31,500 --> 03:23:33,500
I sneezed and I hiccuped

Um

2728
03:23:36,460 --> 03:23:38,460
Oh, I can feel another sneeze

03:23:39,580 --> 03:23:41,580

2735
03:24:04,060 --> 03:24:06,380
Because I am starting to get a wee bit delirious

2736
03:24:06,940 --> 03:24:11,580
We've got a tunnel vision is occurring my outside viewing point. Definitely not as good

2737
03:24:13,020 --> 03:24:15,340
Uh, qu'on a mschit qu'on a mschit messes. Um

2738
03:24:15,900 --> 03:24:17,100
Um

2739

You just got some snacks you really can't wait anymore like god damn it streamer get off

2740

Yes for any harem members that are lurking in the shadows, please be advised that none other than she be cotton boom is live right now

2741
03:24:31,020 --> 03:24:33,260

I'm so focused on the wines though. You'll make it. It's less than an hour if you lock in. Okay

2743
03:24:40,860 --> 03:24:44,700

2744
03:24:45,020 --> 03:24:51,980
Um reefling if you could just uh start preparing for the ink for the tea. That'd be great. Um

2745
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:55,500
Yeah, ready? Okay

2746
03:24:55,500 --> 03:24:57,500
Such an ASMR announcement

2747
03:24:57,580 --> 03:25:03,020
Hmm reefling sometimes you have to force this woman to take care of herself. Remember that. Thank you for the great yap fest

2748
03:25:03,180 --> 03:25:08,700
Gonna give she be some love. Yes, please do not be afraid to show any of my gen mates love. I have absolutely no

2749
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:11,500
Whatever the word is is a jealousy

2750
03:25:11,900 --> 03:25:18,140
What is it? You know what we should actually create a name for the vtuber jealousy phenomenon

2751
03:25:18,700 --> 03:25:22,380
I'm here for it. We should create a new term right now in the english language

2752
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:25,660
for when a vtuber is like

2753
03:25:26,460 --> 03:25:32,540
Don't watch other vtuber's but like not because they're like yandere and like mercy doesn't count because she's yandere, you know what i'm saying

2754
03:25:33,180 --> 03:25:38,140
But like we should actually call it and it's like it's the female vtuber phenomenon

2755
03:25:38,380 --> 03:25:43,580
Where they get jealous envy tuba. Maybe envy. Mmm

2756
03:25:45,340 --> 03:25:47,340
Envy cute possessive girlfriend

2757
03:25:47,980 --> 03:25:51,660
Extranged tuba possessive. It's literally called a vendetta. Wait

2758
03:25:52,380 --> 03:25:54,140
What's the definition of it?

2759
03:25:54,140 --> 03:25:55,660
Vendetta

2760
03:25:55,660 --> 03:26:01,740
The effort initiative all done. Let's pull up google for this one lads because I actually don't know it off the top of my head

2761
03:26:01,740 --> 03:26:03,740
What a vendetta is

2762
03:26:04,380 --> 03:26:11,660
Let me just brew some wine then you make me vendetta a blood feud in which the family of the murdered person seeks vengeance

2763
03:26:15,500 --> 03:26:24,060
Or a prolonged bitter quarrel with with or campaign against someone. Okay. That one seems more like it

2764
03:26:25,740 --> 03:26:30,060
A bit of a a bit of a bitterness. How about that a bit of bitterness?

2765
03:26:30,620 --> 03:26:32,620
Yeah, it's probably a bit more

2766
03:26:33,100 --> 03:26:34,780
Don't be self-centered

2767
03:26:34,780 --> 03:26:38,220
Wrong definition. Isn't that called parasocial? I don't

2768
03:26:39,660 --> 03:26:43,180
No, isn't parasocial when someone wants to show up to your house?

2769
03:26:45,180 --> 03:26:47,980
I thought that's what parasocial the definition of parasocial is

2770
03:26:48,620 --> 03:26:51,500
When someone genuinely wants to show up to your house. It's like

2771
03:26:52,460 --> 03:26:54,460
Serion mate. Serion

2772
03:26:54,780 --> 03:27:01,420
The convention sure show up to the convention my house. No, sorry. Uh, gimme. He's gonna start freaking out. No, that's the stalker

2773
03:27:01,980 --> 03:27:06,780
Okay, no, that's talk. Wait, so then what's parasocial parasocial is getting attached online

2774
03:27:09,740 --> 03:27:11,740
There's levels, but yeah, that would be better

2775
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:17,660
Yeah, I used to have people that said they were going to show up to my house. Uh, maybe don't do that

2776
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:20,620
Maybe don't do that

2777
03:27:21,180 --> 03:27:26,460
Parasocial is projected one-sided friendship. Parasocial would be me saying strone's my best though when she doesn't even know my name

2778
03:27:27,180 --> 03:27:29,420
And yet I can read your name in chat right now shopping behavior

2779
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:34,060
Is it is it like warped perception of reality?

2780
03:27:36,220 --> 03:27:41,820
One-sided relationship with someone you've never met so you actually see yourself as someone's significant other. Ah, okay. Okay

2781
03:27:44,140 --> 03:27:45,500
So

2782
03:27:45,580 --> 03:27:50,700
It would be reality is not in check. I remember sweet Anita talking about her stalker situation

2783
03:27:50,700 --> 03:27:52,380
I don't know Benny you guys heard about it

2784
03:27:52,540 --> 03:27:58,140
It was like the guy literally bought a house across the road from her and would sleep in her garden in that and like peep through

2785
03:27:58,140 --> 03:27:59,580
her litter box

2786
03:27:59,580 --> 03:28:05,260
And like wake her up during the night and all that and she's just the police refuse to do anything and she's just like

2787
03:28:05,900 --> 03:28:08,460
Oh wait, I don't know if there is an update. Maybe I'm making that up

2788
03:28:08,700 --> 03:28:14,860
But she basically has accepted that the only way the guy's ever gonna be dealt with via the law

2789
03:28:15,180 --> 03:28:19,580
Is she'll be murdered, which is actually quite a common case

2790
03:28:22,140 --> 03:28:29,260
For stalking situations, I wouldn't be surprised if there might be new stalking laws coming out in the next few years because

2791
03:28:30,540 --> 03:28:32,540
uh, yeah

2792
03:28:33,100 --> 03:28:38,220
The parasocial knife cuts both ways because just just as we get attached to vtuber vtuber get attached to us

2793
03:28:38,780 --> 03:28:40,860
Yes, I agree with that sentiment

2794
03:28:41,820 --> 03:28:44,540
And like we said strong, he's my wife and I wasn't joking

2795
03:28:45,180 --> 03:28:47,180
Ah, right

2796
03:28:47,260 --> 03:28:49,260
But you know my husband

2797
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:52,060
Husband riefling husband riefling has

2798
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:55,020
husband

2799
03:28:55,020 --> 03:28:55,980
sling

2800
03:28:55,980 --> 03:28:57,500
husband

2801
03:28:57,500 --> 03:28:59,500
Reef bend reef bend

2802
03:29:01,660 --> 03:29:08,140
Don't be co-dependent to the corporal. Oh, no. Oh, if I guess it's out of the peeler allegations. I might allow it

2803
03:29:08,540 --> 03:29:11,420
I just make the honey tea around here

2804
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:16,940
That's curious, it's curious

2805
03:29:16,940 --> 03:29:21,580
It's like one of those forbidden topics you're not supposed to talk about but when you open when you openly talk about it

2806
03:29:21,580 --> 03:29:26,940
It's like, okay. Okay. We're just getting perspectives in everyone's thought process. Well, it's almost like when you openly discuss things and

2807
03:29:27,420 --> 03:29:29,580
Instead of just assume things behind closers

2808
03:29:30,620 --> 03:29:32,620
like wild wild

2809
03:29:33,580 --> 03:29:36,780
Husbandling husband, that's kind of cute

2810
03:29:37,740 --> 03:29:43,020
And we're played runescape. So I have no idea what's going on. It seems like a just-chan. It is absolutely a just-chan

2811
03:29:43,180 --> 03:29:45,820
We are basically doing the crazy crazy task

2812
03:29:46,620 --> 03:29:47,980
of

2813
03:29:47,980 --> 03:29:49,020
reducing

2814
03:29:49,020 --> 03:29:50,220
Oh, it popped

2815
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:51,740
84

2816
03:29:51,740 --> 03:29:56,940
Let's go. Okay. Maybe I should go for food now like actually go for food this time

2817
03:29:58,300 --> 03:30:03,740
Um, yes. No runescape is just an opportunity for me to yap your ear off for hours on end

2818
03:30:03,820 --> 03:30:10,780
I'm so sorry. You have fallen for my pranks yet again. You have fallen for my ruse. Um, I have misled you astray

2819
03:30:11,420 --> 03:30:17,100
And to think that this is just a regular game. It's not. It's just another excuse for me to tell you about the capitalist

2820
03:30:19,500 --> 03:30:23,340
I keep thinking that level sound is actually a jumpstart. Oh, I'm so sorry. How loud do you listen?

2821
03:30:24,140 --> 03:30:27,980
Do you not listen on a low volume? Please make sure you're not listening too loud

2822
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:35,580
Um, because I will break your eardrums. Uh, when I get too excited. Do I make myself clear that husband briefly?

2823
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:37,260
Aw

2824
03:30:37,260 --> 03:30:43,020
Thank you for the tip Zarian that husband literally me. Have I seen any that come literally me?

2825
03:30:43,820 --> 03:30:48,620
No, I think our new version is that baby is literally me and I'm the father. I like that

2826
03:30:49,260 --> 03:30:52,780
I'm enjoying that quite a lot right now. Um

2827
03:30:53,740 --> 03:31:00,220
The husband and the baby is me. I like that hydration check right. Okay fine fine. I'm freaking I'll go get food

2828
03:31:00,300 --> 03:31:04,540
I can't believe it. I can't believe my bodily functions need to take priority

2829
03:31:04,860 --> 03:31:09,260
Man, why can't I just stream for hours on end? Like honestly, don't be so rude

2830
03:31:10,460 --> 03:31:13,820
But your voice even if excited is fine at high volume the level up is not

2831
03:31:14,220 --> 03:31:17,900
Okay, even great football you happen. If I had a headless headset

2832
03:31:18,060 --> 03:31:21,260
I would like take you to the kitchen with me and I'll be like, hi Gimli

2833
03:31:21,740 --> 03:31:24,860
I bet you Gimli's gonna come flying around the corner the moment I leave this room

2834
03:31:25,420 --> 03:31:27,980
Thank you for tip, right? I'll be give me four minutes

2835
03:31:27,980 --> 03:31:32,380
It takes like four minutes for the kettle to boil and I'll see if there's anything I can microwave if not

2836
03:31:33,260 --> 03:31:39,740
I might be ordering a cheeky takeaway after um, I'll host a I'll be direct into Azura Azura is playing

2837
03:31:41,980 --> 03:31:43,980
That one game I've already forgotten

2838
03:31:44,540 --> 03:31:47,500
What's the name of the game Azura is playing?

2839
03:31:48,780 --> 03:31:53,660
A whole four minutes. I have you on 5.1 surround system. Please bless me. That's Scottish boys. No

2840
03:31:54,780 --> 03:31:59,580
Yeah, yes Azura is playing Little Nightmares, which is a fantastic 10 out of 10 game

2841
03:32:00,060 --> 03:32:04,220
Um, I'm very excited to see her playthrough of that and I will be

2842
03:32:04,860 --> 03:32:09,420
Hopefully if it's a good stream, I might be able to get highlight reel made of that stream

2843
03:32:09,660 --> 03:32:15,260
I'm gonna see if I can get a buckshot roulette highlight reel made of my stream possibly

2844
03:32:15,820 --> 03:32:18,220
I think you deserve more takeaway. That's just because

2845
03:32:20,140 --> 03:32:23,100
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's mm-hmm. Yeah

2846
03:32:23,820 --> 03:32:28,540
Okay, I will actually go get food and get a drink. Oh, I'm lightheaded because of dehydration

2847
03:32:28,620 --> 03:32:34,300
I just shook my head up and down there. Okay. I will actually go that was scary. I will be back in four minutes

2848
03:32:39,420 --> 03:32:41,420
So

2849
03:33:10,300 --> 03:33:12,300
Are you squiddling me right now?

2850
03:33:30,940 --> 03:33:32,940
Are you squiddling me right now?

2851
03:33:39,420 --> 03:33:41,420
You

2852
03:33:53,420 --> 03:33:55,420
Are you squiddling me right now?

2853
03:34:09,420 --> 03:34:11,420
Are you squiddling me right now?

2854
03:34:39,420 --> 03:34:41,420
You

2855
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:11,420
You

2856
03:35:39,420 --> 03:35:41,420
You

2857
03:36:09,420 --> 03:36:11,420
You

2858
03:36:39,420 --> 03:36:41,420
You

2859
03:37:09,420 --> 03:37:11,420
You

2860
03:37:39,420 --> 03:37:42,380
Oh

2861
03:38:09,420 --> 03:38:11,420
You

2862
03:38:25,980 --> 03:38:27,980
Yeah, I kind of scared myself

2863
03:38:28,140 --> 03:38:33,580
With a lightheaded moment. I have so much food with me right now. It's like funny. I think so before though

2864
03:38:33,980 --> 03:38:35,980
This is Gimli and Bebo are

2865
03:38:36,300 --> 03:38:39,420
Waiting to launch themselves in the down room

2866
03:38:41,340 --> 03:38:43,340
Okay

2867
03:38:43,420 --> 03:38:47,580
So if you hear some my awing it's very possible. I can still hear him

2868
03:38:48,220 --> 03:38:51,420
I ain't going to do it. We need to be sure she takes care of herself

2869
03:38:52,140 --> 03:38:54,940
Yeah, I'm good to go. Okay. Oh

2870
03:38:55,740 --> 03:38:57,740
Hold on ain't it bro

2871
03:38:59,020 --> 03:39:02,060
Okay, I have uh leftover yippies

2872
03:39:03,020 --> 03:39:05,020
There's five had enough to actually cook them away

2873
03:39:09,500 --> 03:39:11,500
I've got tea

2874
03:39:11,900 --> 03:39:16,780
I want a Nutella bar. I've got a bowl of leftover cheesy chips. I've got my

2875
03:39:17,740 --> 03:39:21,660
Chocolate covered raisins, which I've yet to successfully eat. I've taken them out twice now

2876
03:39:22,300 --> 03:39:27,660
The novel I've got wee blueberry muffin. I don't know if you can hear me spank it a little bit and then

2877
03:39:28,220 --> 03:39:33,420
The piece de resistance. I have a um fruit juice and a glass because you know

2878
03:39:35,420 --> 03:39:36,460
Um

2879
03:39:36,460 --> 03:39:40,060
It's good for you and it's got like seven different types of fruit and it's the only thing that's

2880
03:39:40,700 --> 03:39:43,980
Probably keeping me alive right now. Um successfully

2881
03:39:44,700 --> 03:39:46,060
and

2882
03:39:46,060 --> 03:39:50,140
Yeah, I'm about to stuff my face and drink and get a ton of sugar in my body because that's scary

2883
03:39:52,140 --> 03:39:54,460
I feel this one's a good girl damn straight good girl

2884
03:39:58,620 --> 03:40:05,020
I'm inhaling these chips, please you're welcome to eat with me if you so desire, itadakimasu

2885
03:40:06,940 --> 03:40:11,500
It's like actual fruit. This has apple coconut water

2886
03:40:12,540 --> 03:40:15,020
and mango passion fruit dragon fruit

2887
03:40:15,820 --> 03:40:16,780
and

2888
03:40:16,780 --> 03:40:18,780
It's like really healthy

2889
03:40:18,940 --> 03:40:20,940
Uh try and eat one

2890
03:40:21,500 --> 03:40:27,740
Eat one I try and drink one at least every week because I don't eat a lot of fruit

2891
03:40:27,740 --> 03:40:32,780
But I eat tons of vegetables. She says that she eats cheesy chips that doesn't count. Um

2892
03:40:34,940 --> 03:40:40,300
But I'll try and have one every week because I think it's keeping the scurvy away

2893
03:40:43,340 --> 03:40:44,700
Um

2894
03:40:44,700 --> 03:40:48,460
I just never seem to buy fruit like I feel like it always goes off where it's always like

2895
03:40:49,180 --> 03:40:54,300
Not like a way too late to eat it and I don't want to be wasteful, you know

2896
03:40:56,860 --> 03:40:59,340
What percent is juice? What does that mean?

2897
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:06,140
A hundred percent no concentrate zero added sugar zero artificial

2898
03:41:07,180 --> 03:41:10,140
Um it says on the the patent game

2899
03:41:12,140 --> 03:41:17,740
So it's supposed to be super good for me. Hopefully if not, I've been lied to how dare you how dare I be lied to

2900
03:41:18,940 --> 03:41:20,940
Mm-hmm

2901
03:41:26,460 --> 03:41:29,180
Yeah, you have to eat on the day you get it literally like sauce but

2902
03:41:30,540 --> 03:41:34,460
I've been so disappointed with supermarkets lately that I've been using like

2903
03:41:35,020 --> 03:41:40,060
independent stores and the quality of the and it's so cheaper and so different quality as well

2904
03:41:41,580 --> 03:41:46,540
Like these super fucking mental national chains is just like nothing

2905
03:41:49,340 --> 03:41:51,340
My god

2906
03:41:51,580 --> 03:41:57,340
You forget how good food tastes until you eat it. Oh, yeah, this should this should bang him

2907
03:42:01,980 --> 03:42:06,460
Let me shake up my fruit juice so I can uh confirm that I've had my five a day for today

2908
03:42:08,620 --> 03:42:09,260
Mm

2909
03:42:09,260 --> 03:42:13,580
They say the Mediterranean diet is the best one you can do because they have like so much fruit and veg in it

2910
03:42:13,580 --> 03:42:14,940
And fish as well

2911
03:42:14,940 --> 03:42:21,340
Fish is good for you, but the only fish I can eat the sun's terrible. I'm just so pretty. Oh, I just spilled my juice

2912
03:42:23,020 --> 03:42:29,340
I spilled a little bit on my mouse mat. So now it gets to be on me and yeah, oh have a napkin. Thank god. I have a napkin

2913
03:42:31,820 --> 03:42:34,780
Okay bottoms up I uh, we support local businesses

2914
03:42:38,060 --> 03:42:39,660
Mm-hmm

2915
03:42:39,740 --> 03:42:43,740
Oh this shit busting for real. I love mango mangoes delicious fruit

2916
03:42:44,940 --> 03:42:50,380
Yeah, like cod fish and chips haddock is the only fish I can eat because it's fucking battered and fried and I'm like, bro

2917
03:42:50,460 --> 03:42:55,820
How how how more British can I get? I tried to eat salmon couldn't have it. I don't mind shrimp

2918
03:42:56,220 --> 03:42:57,500
um

2919
03:42:57,500 --> 03:43:03,260
Shrimp isn't that bad, but there's not really many things. I have it with a baked potato, but I don't have it with any else

2920
03:43:04,220 --> 03:43:09,260
Maybe I should try and make a shrimp salad to get more fish in me because fish is like really good for you

2921
03:43:10,140 --> 03:43:16,140
When it's not full of mercury thanks to humans and dumping things in the water where it doesn't belong

2922
03:43:20,300 --> 03:43:22,300
Oh good

2923
03:43:24,540 --> 03:43:26,540
Oh fucking good

2924
03:43:27,580 --> 03:43:29,580
Almost finished it

2925
03:43:29,580 --> 03:43:31,580
And then we'll move on to the next items

2926
03:43:32,540 --> 03:43:34,140
who will

2927
03:43:34,140 --> 03:43:37,420
So who will be the refund to clean the mouse pad? No, not you

2928
03:43:40,140 --> 03:43:44,060

03:43:49,020 --> 03:43:51,020

And thank you Brian for announcing little refling's words. Thank you for so it's very kind of you not you don't need to worry about me

2932
03:43:57,820 --> 03:43:59,820
Okay, you don't need to worry about me

2933
03:44:00,460 --> 03:44:02,460
I

2934
03:44:03,740 --> 03:44:08,460
Have the tism and it enables me to do things and that's why I can do all this stuff

2935
03:44:08,460 --> 03:44:10,460
So don't worry about me. Okay

2936
03:44:10,620 --> 03:44:14,780
If you mean forgetting to eat and drink that's literally because I'm having such a good time

2937
03:44:15,260 --> 03:44:19,740
Like streaming and I don't really want to like interrupt that moment for a few moments, you know

2938
03:44:24,940 --> 03:44:29,020
What a strange pee is it polska? I don't know what it is. I actually don't know what currency that is

2939
03:44:29,020 --> 03:44:31,980
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Is it peso weaponized?

2940
03:44:34,780 --> 03:44:36,780
I know that feeling yes

2941
03:44:36,940 --> 03:44:40,300
Like I'm just getting something like I'm sure you guys have been lost in the sauce

2942
03:44:40,300 --> 03:44:45,740
Like if you've ever played a video game and then like you kind of wake out wake up from your trance on the other side

2943
03:44:45,820 --> 03:44:49,260
You're like, oh my god, I haven't eaten or drank and like a couple of hours type thing

2944
03:44:49,260 --> 03:44:51,900
Like it's kind of like that with streaming like I just cannot shut up

2945
03:44:52,380 --> 03:44:56,380
Uh, I love it. I'll have an amazing time with the reflins. Hopefully the content is good

2946
03:44:56,380 --> 03:45:01,900
I know some people runescape residents sleeper. But look, it's one of my goals. Okay. Once it's once it's done

2947
03:45:01,900 --> 03:45:04,540
We don't have to come back. Okay. Once it's done

2948
03:45:05,500 --> 03:45:10,860
And we're doing a watch along and the next one. So we have like a topic of conversation

2949
03:45:10,860 --> 03:45:14,620
So don't worry about having to like talk and we are going to do the

2950
03:45:15,900 --> 03:45:19,420
Is it john wick is john wick. We're going to do the john wick series

2951
03:45:20,220 --> 03:45:25,900
Whilst I do wines in the background and we might do it like that until we get very close to the end

2952
03:45:26,540 --> 03:45:31,260
And I'll just do one big massive. Yeah, because I kind of saw myself six there. Thank you for coming and remember

2955
03:45:43,740 --> 03:45:45,740
Sorry grapes and water together

2956
03:45:46,620 --> 03:45:48,300
Don't be silly

2957
03:45:48,300 --> 03:45:54,940
Don't be silly. This is the elusive gameplay that you have always craved your entire life. No vtuber has done it before

2958
03:45:55,020 --> 03:45:59,980
Yes, a vtuber most likely has done it. Apparently john wick five is in production. That better be a joke

2959
03:46:00,060 --> 03:46:02,540
I wanted to watch a series that had a finished end

2960
03:46:04,380 --> 03:46:08,540
Uh, should we watch a different type of series then? What could we watch?

2961
03:46:09,100 --> 03:46:11,660
What is something that has free free films? That's good

2962
03:46:13,580 --> 03:46:17,820
Does transformers was there like five transformers or am I making that up?

2963
03:46:20,940 --> 03:46:24,300
No john wick isn't finished. Oh come on, right

2964
03:46:25,180 --> 03:46:27,180
Maybe we'll pick something else then

2965
03:46:27,660 --> 03:46:31,980
I want a start of a story and I want an end of a story. Is that too much to ask for?

2966
03:46:33,180 --> 03:46:35,180
Because it clearly is

2967
03:46:37,820 --> 03:46:41,020
Just a a cheeky series spider-man

2968
03:46:45,580 --> 03:46:50,220
No, I don't think spider-man would do honestly watching story play runescape makes me question getting back into that

2969
03:46:50,220 --> 03:46:54,460
I'm only concerned with that keeper runescapes that you can pick it up and drop it at any time

2970
03:46:54,540 --> 03:46:57,100
And like get a feel for like doing the free stuff

2971
03:46:57,580 --> 03:46:59,900
Like I don't think you need membership to buy wine

2972
03:46:59,980 --> 03:47:03,580
So if you wanted night night cooking like you can do it whilst like getting items and all that

2973
03:47:04,460 --> 03:47:12,060
Um kung fu panda if you ignore the force. I've actually not seen the other kung fu pandas. I only saw the first one

2974
03:47:13,260 --> 03:47:17,500
Maybe we should watch kung fu panda and we just pretend the force doesn't we do not see the four

2975
03:47:17,500 --> 03:47:19,500
I'm

2976
03:47:19,740 --> 03:47:25,100
Before we end up nerding out on star wars, but that's about nine installments technically

2977
03:47:26,780 --> 03:47:30,780
The godfather I've never seen the godfather before it's like a three installments

2978
03:47:34,940 --> 03:47:36,940
Wow

2979
03:47:39,420 --> 03:47:45,180
Okay, fruit juice is finished. I am now being nutritionalized in fruit juice with natural sugars

2980
03:47:45,180 --> 03:47:48,780
And um all the goodness and five a big

2981
03:47:49,660 --> 03:47:56,140
Vic the victim vitamin that come with my life has become so not sure how many movies apparently that's the golden cap

2982
03:47:56,220 --> 03:48:02,140
Godfather is so good. I don't care for the godfather. Oh, I'll chance a bit chance a bit. I'm not sure about the godfather. Um,

2983
03:48:02,540 --> 03:48:04,540
It's a bit well

2984
03:48:05,260 --> 03:48:07,260
The dark night

2985
03:48:07,260 --> 03:48:09,260
Is that got free installments?

2986
03:48:09,820 --> 03:48:15,500
Maybe we do the dark night. I wouldn't mind the dark night with it with Heath Ledger that one

2987
03:48:16,540 --> 03:48:19,900
Did it finish did he did the Heath Ledger finish the series didn't I?

2988
03:48:25,340 --> 03:48:30,300
Oh, I do want to watch austin powers. Why please do it before the peeler. Oh, no

2989
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:33,260
We have to watch austin power

2990
03:48:35,980 --> 03:48:37,980
Hmm

2991
03:48:38,700 --> 03:48:40,700
I've never seen back to the future actually

2992
03:48:43,020 --> 03:48:47,020
All I know is that his mum wants to bone him when I'm like, oh, this is my kind of pot

2993
03:48:48,860 --> 03:48:50,540
Oh, who was it?

2994
03:48:50,540 --> 03:48:54,540
Oh, who goes there identification? Sorry. I'm like, uh, my fork is hitting the ball

2995
03:48:57,100 --> 03:48:59,820
It passed away are you squinting me right now?

2996
03:49:01,340 --> 03:49:06,060
I subbed to your patreon to listen to the clapping hands clapping hands

2997
03:49:06,380 --> 03:49:10,460
I'm just ASMR and I have to say it was a great listen

2998
03:49:10,940 --> 03:49:15,580
Yeah, I've never heard anything like this in my years of being of tuber. Oh my god

2999
03:49:15,580 --> 03:49:21,900
I hope you do this again in the future. Yeah, sure. Jeez. Thank you for the 20 jason. I'm glad you enjoyed it

3000
03:49:21,900 --> 03:49:27,580
Thanks for the support on patreon as well. That's hilarious. I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was just a stupid idea

3001
03:49:28,860 --> 03:49:34,380
I was like, oh, I can clap without using my hands. So I'll make an ASMR about it like ha ha ha

3002
03:49:35,100 --> 03:49:38,940
Um, and I just went for it. It was just like a silly idea

3003
03:49:39,820 --> 03:49:42,060
I'm glad you enjoyed it. That's funny as anything

3004
03:49:46,620 --> 03:49:47,980
Hmm

3005
03:49:47,980 --> 03:49:49,420
Okay

3006
03:49:49,420 --> 03:49:53,660
All my chips are gone. I've eaten chips. I've finished a drink. I'm gonna have a sip of water now

3007
03:49:54,860 --> 03:49:57,740
Could watch alien if you ignore the force no one likes the force

3008
03:49:58,460 --> 03:50:00,140
Hmm

3009
03:50:00,140 --> 03:50:05,420
Yeah, that audio wrecked me. Who lost to the audio admit it right now. I want to know if you lost

3010
03:50:05,900 --> 03:50:08,300
Can you it's just me jumping up a boom

3011
03:50:16,700 --> 03:50:20,380
I lost to the audio I lost you lost you nailed

3012
03:50:21,660 --> 03:50:23,660
Yeah

3013
03:50:23,980 --> 03:50:28,460
Not beating the alley the alley gunkies about having a dump being veal or

3014
03:50:30,060 --> 03:50:32,060
I am going to do a big burp

3015
03:50:40,940 --> 03:50:44,060
This is why I can't eat and be on make at the same time

3016
03:50:45,020 --> 03:50:47,020
Oh

3017
03:50:52,620 --> 03:50:55,420
Please tell me someone just taped my dick twitched

3018
03:50:59,100 --> 03:51:02,300
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

3019
03:51:04,300 --> 03:51:11,340
Like I just um, I do apologize, but I can't help but that had reverb and everything

3020
03:51:11,820 --> 03:51:13,340
I

3021
03:51:13,340 --> 03:51:18,380
Was so fun that one had depth to it. I could feel it coming. I was like, well, that's gonna be a burp

3022
03:51:19,500 --> 03:51:20,940
Yeah

3023
03:51:20,940 --> 03:51:22,940
Mukbang ASMR is going to be 30%

3024
03:51:23,100 --> 03:51:27,980
Oh, maybe I should upload the burp in ASMR is by 2k or should I make it a normal one?

3025
03:51:28,140 --> 03:51:32,780
No, I posted a normal one for one key. So for the second one, I'm going to put another meme one

3026
03:51:32,780 --> 03:51:38,540
I have a burp in ASMR that I've already recorded. It's just me drinking coal and water and burping all the way through it

3027
03:51:38,780 --> 03:51:42,140
And before that gets a warning

3028
03:51:42,620 --> 03:51:49,100
No, that wouldn't get surely surely someone can burp on youtube.com surely does not get that bad

3029
03:51:50,780 --> 03:51:54,780
I'll see I'll edit and see if I think it's bad or not because I don't want another warning

3030
03:51:56,220 --> 03:52:00,940
Uh burping ASMR. Yeah, that's right. We have no manners here. I was raised in a barn

3031
03:52:01,820 --> 03:52:05,580
I'm just probably gonna get some weird comments. Look as long as you guys are happy. I'm happy

3032
03:52:05,820 --> 03:52:11,420
I provide the weirdness you indulge in the weirdness. Oh, oh my god. It's my gen name indulge

3033
03:52:11,500 --> 03:52:14,860
Wow, I wonder why a name does indulge. It's almost like you're to indulge in the girls

3034
03:52:15,580 --> 03:52:17,580
Crazy concept. All right muffin time

3035
03:52:20,460 --> 03:52:22,460
You're breathing it's not like

3036
03:52:23,340 --> 03:52:28,300
So on it. I don't want a burping interest, but you may give me one. Have mercy, please. That's hilarious

3037
03:52:29,580 --> 03:52:31,340
I remember

3038
03:52:31,340 --> 03:52:35,580
Someone was like, wait, why are you guys in a burping and they're like imagine

3039
03:52:37,180 --> 03:52:41,660
She slobs down. She finishes the ink sample and then burps

3040
03:52:43,420 --> 03:52:47,980
Because uh how hard she was eating the the ink sample

3041
03:52:52,700 --> 03:52:54,700
I do have mercy in around five hours

3042
03:52:55,900 --> 03:52:57,900
Uh

3043
03:52:58,460 --> 03:53:03,900
Did I even hit that properly? Sorry, let me do that again. I do have mercy in five hours

3044
03:53:06,860 --> 03:53:08,380
Thank you

3045
03:53:08,380 --> 03:53:12,380
I'll be here for a couple more hours until we read into Zoro so I can take a quick break

3046
03:53:12,860 --> 03:53:14,940
And then I'll make sure me and mercy can see

3047
03:53:15,980 --> 03:53:19,580
I even connect to the same game server and before I show you the internet

3048
03:53:23,900 --> 03:53:25,900
Boo

3049
03:53:28,860 --> 03:53:31,820
I set her up for that. Thank you. I'll steal it myself. Um

3050
03:53:33,580 --> 03:53:37,900
The real funny is actually the reeflings and not me. I just yank your jokes and then play that

3051
03:53:40,060 --> 03:53:43,500
I was thinking of adding a few more sound effects, but I'm not done it yet

3052
03:53:45,260 --> 03:53:47,260
Ah, my muffin's falling apart

3053
03:53:50,780 --> 03:53:52,300
Ah

3054
03:53:52,300 --> 03:53:54,780
I'm almost there. I'm okay. I'm going for muffin

3055
03:53:55,580 --> 03:53:59,500
Yeah, what's next on the roster of fucking eating?

3056
03:54:05,820 --> 03:54:07,820
Maybe

3057
03:54:07,980 --> 03:54:09,820
Maybe one more

3058
03:54:09,820 --> 03:54:15,020
I need one k more wines and then I've reached my goal as Zoro comes on in three hours. I've got plenty of time

3059
03:54:15,340 --> 03:54:17,340
What were we even sweating for?

3060
03:54:18,700 --> 03:54:20,700
Burping is only when

3061
03:54:21,180 --> 03:54:24,540
It's someone you're attracted to it's the same with the peeler stuff. Ah

3062
03:54:26,620 --> 03:54:28,620
You know on the golden

3063
03:54:29,820 --> 03:54:34,700
Uh, I think I might be pushing the upper limits of the AI at the moment

3064
03:54:34,700 --> 03:54:37,580
So please do excuse me if I drop any conversation. All right, I'll do it

3065
03:54:38,620 --> 03:54:39,820
um

3066
03:54:39,820 --> 03:54:44,380
As I said, I literally do not have one piece of content that's limited ads because of um

3067
03:54:45,500 --> 03:54:49,340
The upper I'm very aware of how the AI works. Um

3068
03:54:51,580 --> 03:54:55,420
And you know how it can do like live transcriptions or whatever type thing

3069
03:54:55,580 --> 03:54:58,460
Um, I am able to skirt them one because of my accent

3070
03:54:58,460 --> 03:55:03,180
Which is fantastic because it cannot for the life of itself figure out my accent for a wee bit

3071
03:55:03,420 --> 03:55:06,380
However, AI technology is adapting at a incredibly fast rate

3072
03:55:06,380 --> 03:55:09,260
Which makes me nervous for when it does catch up with the old Scottish accent

3073
03:55:09,660 --> 03:55:14,460
Um, which is why we're probably going to just become multi-cultural and just have like a billion different

3074
03:55:15,100 --> 03:55:17,100
things

3075
03:55:18,060 --> 03:55:20,060
Uh, Scottish accent doesn't count

3076
03:55:20,060 --> 03:55:23,660
Hey, literally if you ever look at the closed captions on my streams

3077
03:55:23,660 --> 03:55:27,340
Like especially when I go super scots like I'm mucking about with that accent or whatever

3078
03:55:27,340 --> 03:55:31,420
It it doesn't have an it does not even comprehend one earth. I'm trying to say

3079
03:55:32,460 --> 03:55:36,220
I don't understand it. Um, which I think helps me with all my

3080
03:55:36,780 --> 03:55:40,620
Skirting of the the conversations we may or may not be having

3081
03:55:47,660 --> 03:55:49,660
Mm-hmm

3082
03:55:49,980 --> 03:55:51,980
Okay, I've had some water

3083
03:55:52,300 --> 03:55:56,060
Yeah, in general it happens wherever AI fears the scots. Can you understand us?

3084
03:55:56,780 --> 03:56:02,700
Scottish accent is an enigma to the human brain as well. So I think you're safer a bit until you all become scots with me

3085
03:56:02,940 --> 03:56:04,300
so

3086
03:56:04,300 --> 03:56:10,460
All right, I'm gonna finally open up this bag of raisins. So I commit to eating some of them because I've had them for how long

3087
03:56:11,740 --> 03:56:13,740
Oh, jeez I can't oh, it's

3088
03:56:14,540 --> 03:56:16,540
Oh, okay, we're in we're in

3089
03:56:17,980 --> 03:56:19,980
Oh that smell rather

3090
03:56:20,140 --> 03:56:22,140
My smell of smell smells delicious

3091
03:56:23,580 --> 03:56:28,860
All right, let's who wants a chocolate covered raisin and please don't make fun of me for liking chocolate covered raisins

3092
03:56:28,940 --> 03:56:31,820
I really like chocolate covered raisins. Okay. They're a nice snack

3093
03:56:32,380 --> 03:56:34,380
um

3094
03:56:34,940 --> 03:56:36,940
Oh, no, there's shit

3095
03:56:37,900 --> 03:56:39,900
I spent so much money on the

3096
03:56:40,620 --> 03:56:42,620
really shit

3097
03:56:44,460 --> 03:56:50,540
No, this can't be I spent so much money on it. Can you be shite? I'm not loving it to be shite

3098
03:56:52,620 --> 03:56:55,580
Yeah, the reason reasons are nice. You guys don't like raisins

3099
03:57:00,140 --> 03:57:01,900
Oh

3100
03:57:01,900 --> 03:57:08,780
I'll tell you something that might filter you from me. I like oat and raisin cookies. I actually think they're the bee's knees

3101
03:57:10,060 --> 03:57:13,660
You get a nice buttery oate cookie. It's delicious

3102
03:57:14,700 --> 03:57:17,740
You get filtered get filtered get filtered

3103
03:57:20,300 --> 03:57:23,180
I think they're nice. You get a nice buttery homemade one. They're so good

3104
03:57:27,660 --> 03:57:29,660
Hmm

3105
03:57:32,460 --> 03:57:38,140
I think some variant of scots was used in world war two for announcements so the germans couldn't keep up

3106
03:57:38,300 --> 03:57:41,500
That's hilarious. You know that you've no been talking on this. Have you?

3107
03:57:44,300 --> 03:57:50,220
Those aren't rabies raisins she be was over earlier. Oh my god. This is like completely off topic

3108
03:57:51,420 --> 03:57:53,820
I think I've said this before maybe I haven't

3109
03:57:55,260 --> 03:57:59,420
When I was a child I used to poop like rabbit poop

3110
03:58:00,460 --> 03:58:02,460
And you may be like what?

3111
03:58:02,540 --> 03:58:06,540
Yeah, and my my little poopies look like little rabbit poops

3112
03:58:06,700 --> 03:58:11,580
I don't know what the heck was wrong with me as a child, but I just thought you should know that fun fact

3113
03:58:14,140 --> 03:58:16,540
And now you know you're cursed with the knowledge

3114
03:58:17,260 --> 03:58:18,780
um

3115
03:58:18,780 --> 03:58:20,780
I don't know what it means

3116
03:58:21,020 --> 03:58:23,740
Actually, you know what let's google it. We're in the

3117
03:58:24,620 --> 03:58:26,620
We're in the age of technology

3118
03:58:27,420 --> 03:58:33,340
Um, let's google it. Why do my I look like rabbit

3119
03:58:33,340 --> 03:58:35,340
Um

3120
03:58:38,220 --> 03:58:43,740
Signs of a low fiber diet. Wow. I had no fiber as a child. Am I surprised? No, um

3121
03:58:44,860 --> 03:58:47,180
No, I am not surprised I had any fiber as a child

3122
03:58:48,060 --> 03:58:49,420
um

3123
03:58:49,420 --> 03:58:55,020
I was a bottomless pit as a child. Um, I've been very lucky

3124
03:58:56,380 --> 03:58:59,740
And was blessed with the skinny milinky long legs gene

3125
03:59:00,220 --> 03:59:03,420
Um, but I put it to good use by giving myself a returned butt

3126
03:59:04,220 --> 03:59:06,220
You have no fiber now

3127
03:59:07,420 --> 03:59:10,060
Google's gonna say it's claude or something

3128
03:59:11,420 --> 03:59:14,940
I substituted that word. I know what word you did use but the mall is funny

3129
03:59:16,620 --> 03:59:18,620
Um

3130
03:59:18,700 --> 03:59:20,700
Wait, are you a rabbit in real life? Yeah

3131
03:59:21,420 --> 03:59:25,900
You are not a cull. You are here. I remember it took me so long

3132
03:59:25,980 --> 03:59:29,100
I was like, why on earth did she be called a fan base hero? I don't get it

3133
03:59:30,060 --> 03:59:32,060
um

3134
03:59:34,780 --> 03:59:36,780
I could get it. I don't understand

3135
03:59:41,660 --> 03:59:45,980
Hmm this is a shit cup of tea. I can tell you that much

3136
03:59:48,700 --> 03:59:54,460
I'm definitely adequately fed and warred though. I don't even need the nature valley bar. I don't even need it

3137
03:59:56,460 --> 03:59:58,460
Um

3138
04:00:00,700 --> 04:00:06,300
Okay, thank you for allowing me to do the one of the nastiest burps I've done so far on stream

3139
04:00:06,540 --> 04:00:13,340
Um, and rehydrate and refueling. I no longer feel lightheaded. So we're we're doing good. Thank you for

3140
04:00:14,540 --> 04:00:19,900
Putting up with me. I know some people don't like eating sounds. Uh, do apologize if that is not your hang

3141
04:00:20,380 --> 04:00:21,900
um

3142
04:00:21,900 --> 04:00:28,460
And I completely look at different strokes different folks. Okay different tickles of pickles and all that jazz. You know how it works

3143
04:00:30,620 --> 04:00:31,980
Who's that?

3144
04:00:31,980 --> 04:00:35,180
You can do better. I trust you. I don't know if I could freaking out do that

3145
04:00:35,740 --> 04:00:39,500
The the biggest burps I have is when I eat because I get trapped wind as a swallow

3146
04:00:40,380 --> 04:00:45,100
Thanks for the stream mom my fish. Good luck when meeting. Bye. Bye. We eat me getting ready for stream

3147
04:00:45,740 --> 04:00:48,620
Yeah, you're getting ready for stream. We eat me. I bet you are

3148
04:00:53,260 --> 04:00:55,260
Strokes and pickles cool knowledge of you

3149
04:00:55,900 --> 04:00:59,420
I'm okay with your burps. You're conditioning me towards it. That's terrible

3150
04:01:00,860 --> 04:01:04,620
I prefer the aid burping so disgusting this entire agency burps. Yeah, okay

3151
04:01:05,260 --> 04:01:07,740
You don't burp. You don't burp when you're at home. Chief

3152
04:01:08,220 --> 04:01:11,020
You have to remember we sit in our bedrooms memeing on games

3153
04:01:11,740 --> 04:01:13,820
But what makes you think we're uncomfortable here?

3154
04:01:14,700 --> 04:01:17,260
From around these parts we burp with our mouth wide open

3155
04:01:18,220 --> 04:01:22,460
I don't know where you're from where you're all you all got your your little uh manners

3156
04:01:22,780 --> 04:01:28,380
You got manners and stuff chief get your manners out of here. They did you know manners are set and I'm just

3157
04:01:30,220 --> 04:01:33,180
Burping makes you real you need to more spinach or whole grains and

3158
04:01:33,580 --> 04:01:37,820
General also I found out during the mid-diet granola bars are terrible for nutrition

3159
04:01:38,300 --> 04:01:39,820
Oh, are they?

3160
04:01:39,820 --> 04:01:44,620
I freaking bought some for stream for when I do endurance days with I can't like I can't make foods

3161
04:01:46,540 --> 04:01:48,540
That food literally

3162
04:01:49,020 --> 04:01:51,180
Did you know AI so advanced I can make music now

3163
04:01:51,820 --> 04:01:55,820
It was only a matter of time. Oh, there will be there will be a song made out of only my burps

3164
04:01:56,540 --> 04:02:01,020
I actually so obviously in the day and age of AI technology

3165
04:02:02,060 --> 04:02:09,500
Um, obviously it is a very hard field to navigate because of the implications of how many jobs it can take and how many

3166
04:02:10,060 --> 04:02:12,060
livelihoods it um affects

3167
04:02:12,540 --> 04:02:13,820
um

3168
04:02:13,820 --> 04:02:16,860
And I am no exception. Um, you know

3169
04:02:17,820 --> 04:02:25,740
If you want to be like mega serious the biggest example of like AI taking your jobs as v-tubers

3170
04:02:25,820 --> 04:02:28,540
There's none other than uh neurosama

3171
04:02:29,180 --> 04:02:37,180
And people like thousands of people watching AI to stream. Um, it's quite it's really magnificent if you look into it

3172
04:02:37,180 --> 04:02:39,180
It really is um

3173
04:02:39,180 --> 04:02:42,860
But like it obviously, you know artists, you know artists any like it

3174
04:02:42,940 --> 04:02:47,420
I mean freaking hell me for example, like I didn't really want you to feed my voice

3175
04:02:48,300 --> 04:02:55,820
And then I did consider possibly AI singing of my voice because I cannot sing um due to

3176
04:02:56,860 --> 04:03:04,220
Um vocal damage. Uh, unfortunately, I've damaged my vocal cords successfully. Um in all my journeys that I

3177
04:03:06,780 --> 04:03:09,100
I can't sing the way others can sing, you know

3178
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:12,940
Um, if you didn't know you can't actually train yourself to sing over time

3179
04:03:13,180 --> 04:03:18,060
But I have like perma damaged myself and I've nerfed myself basically

3180
04:03:18,780 --> 04:03:23,180
So I did think I did think like would AI song be

3181
04:03:24,140 --> 04:03:28,700
Acceptable in that instance because I can't produce what the song is but I can feed

3182
04:03:29,500 --> 04:03:35,100
An algorithm my voice to make that song and then it makes it sound like I'm singing type thing. Um

3183
04:03:35,340 --> 04:03:36,540
Um

3184
04:03:36,540 --> 04:03:38,060
But then I'm like

3185
04:03:38,060 --> 04:03:44,060
No, because that's kind of like it's it's a very interesting like morals are coming into economies coming into it

3186
04:03:44,460 --> 04:03:50,300
Everyone's got a wee piece and a wee side thing. Um, and it's very curious. I'm I'm interested to see where it's gonna go

3187
04:03:50,780 --> 04:03:56,940
It's very nerve-wracking as a content creator. However, um, because um

3188
04:04:00,140 --> 04:04:03,900
Content creation basically relies on

3189
04:04:05,740 --> 04:04:08,540
People to fund it. Um

3190
04:04:09,500 --> 04:04:14,460
type thing like obviously I'm a bit different because I'm already like self-funded if that makes sense. Um

3191
04:04:16,700 --> 04:04:23,340
But like if people were to like just straight up stop supporting and being like well this AI posts it for free exactly what I'm looking for

3192
04:04:23,420 --> 04:04:25,180
It's like these are real people

3193
04:04:25,180 --> 04:04:32,060
But then you could start to argue like well that happens with any sort of medium like if there's a better competitor that comes up

3194
04:04:32,060 --> 04:04:35,260
Well, yeah, they've lost out on their business and their pension and their business shuts down

3195
04:04:35,500 --> 04:04:37,500
That's just the way it is in this market

3196
04:04:38,140 --> 04:04:39,100
um

3197
04:04:39,100 --> 04:04:41,580
So it's kind of hard to even get into a real

3198
04:04:42,380 --> 04:04:48,220
Mitty bit of whatever the conversation might be when it comes to AI because there's so many nuances that can come up

3199
04:04:48,540 --> 04:04:52,380
But these nuances are valid in the conversation topic. Um

3200
04:04:53,100 --> 04:04:58,380
It's a double edged sword really it can help smaller game studios or indies produce games faster

3201
04:04:58,700 --> 04:05:03,500
On the other hand it can put others out of business. Yes, the creative field

3202
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:06,140
it it's very

3203
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:13,260
Obviously we're kind of aware about the sinister nature of what AI has been up to recently with creating um

3204
04:05:14,220 --> 04:05:18,620
fakes which is a shame because I don't think anyone should be subjected to that. Um

3205
04:05:19,820 --> 04:05:23,020
You know, I'm I mean obviously as a creator

3206
04:05:23,980 --> 04:05:27,340
I mean I have a bias and I'm like if no one wants that stuff out there

3207
04:05:27,340 --> 04:05:31,020
Don't put it out there if they delete it then let it be deleted type thing

3208
04:05:31,660 --> 04:05:35,340
Um, but that's just my two cents. Um, but I

3209
04:05:35,980 --> 04:05:42,220
I'm aware that on the other side of a viewer being like this person provided me a lot of comfort these videos provided me a lot of comfort

3210
04:05:42,940 --> 04:05:45,020
and

3211
04:05:45,020 --> 04:05:49,340
Yeah, the world ends when AI can write software that actually functions at a high level without tweaking

3212
04:05:49,740 --> 04:05:51,740
I'm about to tweak it

3213
04:05:51,900 --> 04:05:59,020
Uh, I can burp in without holding my hand in front of me. I got hit too much on the back of my head when I was young from

3214
04:05:59,500 --> 04:06:01,500
Oh, sorry. You got whacked as a child

3215
04:06:02,300 --> 04:06:04,300
That's not good

3216
04:06:04,700 --> 04:06:10,300
Did you know it actually throws your nervous system out if you get whacked as a child for correction reasons

3217
04:06:10,940 --> 04:06:14,940
Content creation is enjoyed for the creator's personality or knowledge. So I doubt AI

3218
04:06:15,340 --> 04:06:20,540
Well, see you say that but then my counter argument is Neurosama right now

3219
04:06:21,980 --> 04:06:23,980
Thousands of people watching

3220
04:06:24,940 --> 04:06:28,060
Algorithm essentially a machine learning algorithm

3221
04:06:28,700 --> 04:06:30,220
um

3222
04:06:30,220 --> 04:06:32,220
It's fascinating. It's really fascinating

3223
04:06:32,700 --> 04:06:35,340
It is and obviously, you know, you can be like

3224
04:06:35,900 --> 04:06:39,980
Oh, you're just to be here. You're mad because bought it bought doing better than you and it's like no

3225
04:06:39,980 --> 04:06:42,780
I'm trying to I'm trying to explain the side of like

3226
04:06:43,580 --> 04:06:46,140
This is a a machine

3227
04:06:47,660 --> 04:06:49,660
That has been programmed

3228
04:06:50,620 --> 04:06:55,740
Blade blade runner blade runner there there. That's how I'll connect the dots blade runner

3229
04:06:56,460 --> 04:06:58,460
How about that?

3230
04:06:58,540 --> 04:07:00,540
you know

3231
04:07:00,780 --> 04:07:02,780
I think AI is an inevitable

3232
04:07:02,780 --> 04:07:03,980
It needs

3233
04:07:03,980 --> 04:07:09,500
It's very it's probably what I think is going to happen with AI is it's going to explode

3234
04:07:09,660 --> 04:07:16,700
Everyone has access to it. Then laws and regulations catch up to the explosion, but the damage will already have been done

3235
04:07:16,940 --> 04:07:18,460
I think

3236
04:07:18,460 --> 04:07:25,660
That is what's going to happen my the reasoning. I think it is a blow up and then catch up but damage is done

3237
04:07:26,940 --> 04:07:28,700
YouTube

3238
04:07:28,700 --> 04:07:31,660
In the internet as a whole starting off as baby

3239
04:07:32,620 --> 04:07:39,820
Everyone is catching up to what in real life laws there are because the internet and in real life are two different things

3240
04:07:39,820 --> 04:07:41,820
I think we can all agree on that

3241
04:07:42,220 --> 04:07:45,980
And a reflection of this is the current ongoing

3242
04:07:46,700 --> 04:07:47,820
card

3243
04:07:47,820 --> 04:07:51,100
Sorry, my throat was burping card payment processors

3244
04:07:52,060 --> 04:07:54,060
They are actually

3245
04:07:54,780 --> 04:07:57,500
catching up to almost in real life

3246
04:07:58,460 --> 04:08:00,220
laws and things

3247
04:08:00,220 --> 04:08:06,460
And it's not treating the internet differently. So one of the biggest examples right now is patreon is no longer allowing

3248
04:08:07,340 --> 04:08:09,340
um

3249
04:08:10,060 --> 04:08:12,780
artwork that depicts um

3250
04:08:14,460 --> 04:08:17,100
Any possibility of cnc

3251
04:08:17,740 --> 04:08:20,780
Even though the artworks are artworks and not real people

3252
04:08:21,500 --> 04:08:27,820
But that's because mastercard is bending their arm behind their back because of in real life laws

3253
04:08:27,980 --> 04:08:32,220
Like the internet is being caught up to in real life laws. Does that make sense?

3254
04:08:32,300 --> 04:08:33,740
Hopefully that makes sense

3255
04:08:33,740 --> 04:08:40,780
Doesn't the people watch uh dj and stuff like pranksters you use an ai to enhance your content wouldn't be that bad in the grand scheme of

3256
04:08:41,900 --> 04:08:48,380
Yes, but I didn't what what what makes me hold back from aiing my voice to do song covers is

3257
04:08:49,020 --> 04:08:51,660
One it loses its charm because it's not my croaky voice

3258
04:08:52,380 --> 04:08:53,260
two

3259
04:08:53,340 --> 04:09:02,300
It's it's not a statement of endorsement. No, however, I think it's definitely a like, uh, that's a shame she uses ai

3260
04:09:03,420 --> 04:09:05,420
cncio

3261
04:09:05,660 --> 04:09:06,860
content

3262
04:09:06,860 --> 04:09:08,860
uh con con

3263
04:09:09,500 --> 04:09:12,620
Is what cnc is someone someone type I can't type what it is what you

3264
04:09:13,420 --> 04:09:18,940
Laws become uh antiquated fast even when they do come out. Yes, it's um very interesting to see how the

3265
04:09:19,420 --> 04:09:26,460
Interwebs are being navigated at this moment in time. Oh, I lost it because I was reading we got 72 000 pop. That was fantastic

3266
04:09:27,820 --> 04:09:29,100
um

3267
04:09:29,100 --> 04:09:30,460
Yeah, it's a

3268
04:09:30,460 --> 04:09:35,180
I like the deep diving in the convo is like this. I know like people like shout out shout away

3269
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:39,820
Oh, I don't want to get into it. I don't want to get into it. I want to get in a I want to see what your thoughts are

3270
04:09:39,820 --> 04:09:44,060
I want to tell you what my current thoughts are you might change my mind. We might come to a different thing

3271
04:09:44,060 --> 04:09:47,260
We may talk about this. I don't mind talking about these things

3272
04:09:47,660 --> 04:09:52,300
I think it's nice. I think it's refreshing being able to talk about it. But I mean, that's for me

3273
04:09:53,180 --> 04:09:55,260
Fake version of that. I am she's making winds with

3274
04:09:58,620 --> 04:10:00,620
I don't I can't even translate that

3275
04:10:01,980 --> 04:10:03,980
but yes, um

3276
04:10:04,060 --> 04:10:06,060
l'ma the least ethical players are

3277
04:10:06,860 --> 04:10:10,220
Are stealing their data. Yeah, I think a france

3278
04:10:10,700 --> 04:10:11,900
um

3279
04:10:11,900 --> 04:10:18,140
A french like art school got done for using AI and it was like the most ironic moronic thing and everyone was like, bro

3280
04:10:19,580 --> 04:10:26,060
The AI conversation goes into politics easily. It's because the laws need to actually catch up, which I think maybe

3281
04:10:26,460 --> 04:10:28,460
um, why?

3282
04:10:29,260 --> 04:10:31,260
Probably leaks into that a lot

3283
04:10:32,380 --> 04:10:34,380
But anyway, what do I know? I'm just

3284
04:10:34,780 --> 04:10:39,740
Uh, a cuttlefish that wants to drown all of humanity to he what happens if it wasn't humanity

3285
04:10:40,220 --> 04:10:45,260
Oh, sorry, someone wants to trade my apologies. Hold on. Let me make space. Hold on. Let me just connect these winds

3286
04:10:45,740 --> 04:10:48,300
What's going on here? What's going on here? Right? What's going on here?

3287
04:10:48,940 --> 04:10:52,380
Oh, you give me a what wait? Why is that worth 15k for that one wine?

3288
04:10:53,500 --> 04:10:54,460
What is

3289
04:10:54,460 --> 04:10:56,460
half full wine jug

3290
04:10:57,340 --> 04:11:01,820
What wait, can I half drink? Why is that so much money? Am I going crazy?

3291
04:11:04,300 --> 04:11:06,300
Wine of jug four

3292
04:11:07,100 --> 04:11:09,100
Oh

3293
04:11:09,500 --> 04:11:12,060
Half wine jug 18k

3294
04:11:13,340 --> 04:11:15,340
Infinite moneymaker glitch

3295
04:11:16,140 --> 04:11:20,300
Question mark. Can I like half drink these wines and make like a stupendous amount of money?

3296
04:11:23,420 --> 04:11:25,420
Um

3297
04:11:26,060 --> 04:11:28,060
Am I going crazy?

3298
04:11:28,380 --> 04:11:34,620
Half wine. Why how do I get half a wine? Can you drink used drug used jug? Sorry

3299
04:11:34,940 --> 04:11:39,020
No, dang it. Wait, how do you do half?

3300
04:11:41,020 --> 04:11:43,020
What that's bizarre

3301
04:11:43,660 --> 04:11:45,660
What is it?

3302
04:11:45,820 --> 04:11:51,100
How do you get half you have 25 million? Why do you need look we're here to be billionaires so we can

3303
04:11:51,820 --> 04:11:56,140
bribe the politicians to put in stuff that's actually against it for our interests

3304
04:11:57,260 --> 04:12:03,740
It's a rare item that comes with events. How bizarre. Okay. It's the same reason burnt fish sells for something. Oh, I guess

3305
04:12:04,620 --> 04:12:09,580
Well, it's main. No, thank you. Or do you want the wine back? You're allowed to have it back. By the way, you can just ask

3306
04:12:10,860 --> 04:12:13,420
I'm not actually going to keep it. I'm just surprised. I didn't understand

3307
04:12:15,900 --> 04:12:19,420
A brave politician. Oh as long as it interests their bank account

3308
04:12:20,460 --> 04:12:26,140
And uh, you can pretty much pass whatever you want. As long as you got the the funds to cough up

3309
04:12:28,140 --> 04:12:32,940
Which is why velour is going to be a billion dollar enterprise so we can change the world

3310
04:12:33,020 --> 04:12:37,980
I'm just kidding. We are just anime girls on the internet. We're looking for some ink. Okay

3311
04:12:39,420 --> 04:12:41,420
Yeah, it's called lobbying. Yeah

3312
04:12:42,060 --> 04:12:45,820
And not the good kind of cod lobbies the bad kind of cod lobbies

3313
04:12:46,700 --> 04:12:51,980
Back in my day wine used to be drunk in two gulps leaving behind the half wine after

3314
04:12:52,780 --> 04:12:54,060
We're getting old

3315
04:12:54,060 --> 04:12:59,340
We're getting oh, sorry. Just put that momentary again. We're getting og old scoop lore

3316
04:12:59,580 --> 04:13:03,340
Geez, can I finish the sense right? I'll finish this cup of tea before I finish my next sense

3317
04:13:05,100 --> 04:13:07,100
Vealers already changed me for sure

3318
04:13:07,900 --> 04:13:09,900
Is it black croc? I've changed show but

3319
04:13:11,100 --> 04:13:15,660
Strani's opinions do not represent veal or yes, I have to say that like unironically every stream

3320
04:13:15,900 --> 04:13:21,500
Please do not be like Strani said this so I'm not supporting any of the girls. One. Don't be a fucking pussy

3321
04:13:21,900 --> 04:13:24,540
Of course, I do not speak for all the girls. You absolute

3322
04:13:25,260 --> 04:13:28,300
Um and two

3323
04:13:30,460 --> 04:13:33,980
Why am I not let's go on an autistic rant by everyone else's there'll be rude

3324
04:13:35,340 --> 04:13:37,340
Is it because I'm Scottish be honest

3325
04:13:41,180 --> 04:13:44,620
On the original older version game the wing joke is upwards of 40 bell

3326
04:13:46,780 --> 04:13:48,780
Literally let me go on my right

3327
04:13:49,740 --> 04:13:54,620
What's these things I'm uneducated about and have a little opinion on what oh you shouldn't talk because

3328
04:13:55,020 --> 04:13:58,540
Because oh you shouldn't have an opinion on things. You're not educated

3329
04:13:58,780 --> 04:14:02,220
Uh, what do you think having a brain is about? Uh, what do you think about the learning is about?

3330
04:14:02,540 --> 04:14:04,540
You know, you can present your information for me

3331
04:14:06,220 --> 04:14:09,020
What you struggling with what concept do you struggle in with quick quick quick?

3332
04:14:09,020 --> 04:14:12,140
What concept are you struggling with tell me and I'll talk about it later, bro

3333
04:14:13,100 --> 04:14:18,140
Sorry, I'm arguing with people that aren't even they aren't even here. There aren't there's no one in this room right now

3334
04:14:18,220 --> 04:14:22,140
There's no one seeing anything mean at all. I'm just arguing with potential

3335
04:14:22,380 --> 04:14:25,420
Arguers. I'm absolutely losing it. I'm so sorry reef lens

3336
04:14:26,380 --> 04:14:27,900
anyway

3337
04:14:27,900 --> 04:14:29,900
Why ain't anyone

3338
04:14:31,740 --> 04:14:36,300
I'm absolutely losing it me at the convention just straight up swinging on reef lens

3339
04:14:37,180 --> 04:14:39,180
Oh, no, that's such an

3340
04:14:39,260 --> 04:14:43,820
Unmeaned thought I don't like that idea on my head. She's arguing my ghost

3341
04:14:44,780 --> 04:14:46,780
You want me to take your meds?

3342
04:14:48,460 --> 04:14:50,460
Arguing with the voices

3343
04:14:50,860 --> 04:14:54,220
She's arguing with the restless spirit of her toenail rip toenail

3344
04:14:55,420 --> 04:14:57,100
It's um

3345
04:14:57,100 --> 04:15:03,580
Not as bad as I I thought I I pushed I I would I would confess my sin

3346
04:15:04,460 --> 04:15:07,340
I pushed through the bandage to see what I'd feel

3347
04:15:08,540 --> 04:15:10,140
um

3348
04:15:10,140 --> 04:15:13,500
I'm not gonna push it for a while because one that hurt uh ow

3349
04:15:13,820 --> 04:15:14,780
and two

3350
04:15:14,780 --> 04:15:16,780
Ow and three

3351
04:15:17,260 --> 04:15:22,540
I don't I couldn't really tell what I feel. I think it just feels like touching a normal flesh really

3352
04:15:24,620 --> 04:15:26,620
And

3353
04:15:27,340 --> 04:15:30,140
But yeah, definitely not touching it again for a while because that's done

3354
04:15:30,540 --> 04:15:33,420
I'm on basic painkillers now. Um, it's it's not

3355
04:15:34,540 --> 04:15:37,660
It's really no that bad. It's really no that bad. Um

3356
04:15:38,140 --> 04:15:39,340
Um

3357
04:15:39,340 --> 04:15:43,500
It's probably just gonna be a patience thing now. Um, because it takes forever to heal

3358
04:15:43,500 --> 04:15:47,580
Actually, I should go out in the garden and get some sunlight and me to help heal it off, but

3359
04:15:48,780 --> 04:15:50,780
I want to play rinse

3360
04:15:50,940 --> 04:15:53,660
And then I want to play goose game with mercy

3361
04:15:57,500 --> 04:15:59,500
You can take your frustrations out on us

3362
04:16:00,060 --> 04:16:05,100
Strenuous myths online that all visitors have a voice in their head. I can like argue with myself

3363
04:16:05,180 --> 04:16:09,340
I'm not even being funny. I can just straight up start having arguments with myself about stuff

3364
04:16:09,660 --> 04:16:13,900
Like that's why I like when I do actually go like off the rails on my wee rants a little bit

3365
04:16:14,140 --> 04:16:18,220
It's because I'm in my head. I'm talking to someone that doesn't believe it

3366
04:16:19,180 --> 04:16:23,980
And I have to explain it from the start like as if you were an alien and you've never heard about this before

3367
04:16:24,220 --> 04:16:28,540
And I'm like and that's why I'm always like and another thing and another part of this like, yeah

3368
04:16:29,340 --> 04:16:33,900
Your britain d levels are probably in the gut. No, the sun is too dangerous for me

3369
04:16:34,060 --> 04:16:36,060
I need to go back to pale scotland

3370
04:16:37,020 --> 04:16:41,900
Um, I'm actually in danger of the sun if you didn't know, um skin cancer in

3371
04:16:42,540 --> 04:16:44,540
Australia is no joke. We

3372
04:16:45,020 --> 04:16:46,700
We uh, hung

3373
04:16:46,700 --> 04:16:50,620
Oh, wait, I don't think you're not let's say that terminology. My apologies. Don't don't mean to offend

3374
04:16:51,100 --> 04:16:58,140
We pasty white ghosts are actually not really supposed to be on Australia because uh, we are not suited for the sun

3375
04:16:58,780 --> 04:17:00,780
The sun's rays are extra strong

3376
04:17:00,860 --> 04:17:02,300
Um

3377
04:17:02,300 --> 04:17:08,780
And uh, yeah, isn't it winter there? It is but the sun is still very strong. It doesn't matter

3378
04:17:11,580 --> 04:17:15,340
The uv rays just because it's cold it's still there. Oh my god. My freaking tea is cold

3379
04:17:17,900 --> 04:17:21,900
Because I can't stop talking I don't think I've had a warm cup of tea in weeks

3380
04:17:21,900 --> 04:17:23,900
Oh

3381
04:17:32,060 --> 04:17:34,060
Ozzie and kiwi bro suffering from the sun

3382
04:17:35,420 --> 04:17:37,420
Yeah

3383
04:17:37,900 --> 04:17:41,340
Half Aussie half Scottish will you actually no no no full scots

3384
04:17:45,260 --> 04:17:48,380
If you ever want to run a business and you can pick between scotland and

3385
04:17:48,940 --> 04:17:51,580
Australia do it in Australia you get to keep more of your money

3386
04:17:52,620 --> 04:17:56,220
And then go back to scotland. I mean I'm going back to Scotland

3387
04:18:00,060 --> 04:18:06,220
I I my my pasty white people need me um, and we're having the refund farm in scotland anyway, so

3388
04:18:07,260 --> 04:18:08,860
Yeah, it's uh

3389
04:18:08,860 --> 04:18:14,460
Don't get me wrong Australia beautiful country. Love it. Love the sun. Love my chinese auntie

3390
04:18:14,780 --> 04:18:17,580
Love my granny. I love all these people

3391
04:18:18,380 --> 04:18:25,580
But I am not suited for this country. I am I am too used to the most oppressive ways of the uk. I really am

3392
04:18:26,460 --> 04:18:32,140
Got a brew of tea forget about it microwave it then. Uh, do not ever suggest microwaving a tea in my presence

3393
04:18:32,460 --> 04:18:35,500
You have to start are we raising shape?

3394
04:18:36,620 --> 04:18:39,740
The farm needs eggs because we need protein

3395
04:18:41,100 --> 04:18:43,100
um

3396
04:18:43,260 --> 04:18:44,940
I don't

3397
04:18:44,940 --> 04:18:46,060
want

3398
04:18:46,060 --> 04:18:48,860
I think we just need eggs on the farm reflands

3399
04:18:49,740 --> 04:18:51,420
and then we can have like

3400
04:18:51,420 --> 04:18:56,620
I can make like scrambled egg pepper like from peppers and we grew in the garden

3401
04:18:57,500 --> 04:19:02,140
And then that can be our wee breakfast and then lunch can be a wee sangha

3402
04:19:03,740 --> 04:19:06,220
Would we have wheat production and flour?

3403
04:19:07,260 --> 04:19:09,420
Would we have a flour mill on the farm?

3404
04:19:10,060 --> 04:19:13,340
Thousands of chickens to feed us. I think we need like eight

3405
04:19:13,980 --> 04:19:17,100
Hens lay us and and say I did my research on chickens

3406
04:19:17,500 --> 04:19:22,700
I actually did my research while I was away on holiday wink wink um for a year. Uh

3407
04:19:23,900 --> 04:19:26,460
So chickens lay eggs for

3408
04:19:27,020 --> 04:19:32,700
One to five years and then they are considered an elderly chicken and no longer lay

3409
04:19:32,860 --> 04:19:35,980
Most people just perish the chicken when it stops laying

3410
04:19:36,380 --> 04:19:41,020
I couldn't do that if a chicken has given me eggs for five years and it stops

3411
04:19:41,100 --> 04:19:44,780
I am not going to perish it because it can no longer do it. I want it to live

3412
04:19:44,860 --> 04:19:49,900
It's happy little chicken life in the garden. Okay, like um, some people are brutal with their way

3413
04:19:49,980 --> 04:19:55,020
Uh, their wings their chickens. I said, I guess the chickens are our wings roofland. Um

3414
04:19:57,820 --> 04:20:01,900
But yeah, I they like can lay a lot

3415
04:20:02,860 --> 04:20:06,780
There's also the possibility that we would need

3416
04:20:07,500 --> 04:20:13,500
Ducks on the farm because ducks are natural pest control for slugs and stuff

3417
04:20:14,060 --> 04:20:16,860
So for because I I want to go like natural

3418
04:20:17,100 --> 04:20:21,020
I don't want to use like harsh chemicals or anything to like grow production wise like

3419
04:20:21,580 --> 04:20:24,620
Um fertilizers all that stuff that's bad for the environment

3420
04:20:25,420 --> 04:20:29,260
Um, but ducks and chicken are fantastic for getting bugs and stuff

3421
04:20:29,260 --> 04:20:35,500
But the chicken could not be allowed near the crop harvest because chickens will destroy the crops

3422
04:20:35,740 --> 04:20:41,100
However, ducks do not destroy the crops. Um, only chickens destroy absolutely everything

3423
04:20:41,500 --> 04:20:45,980
They can pot their little beaks can get on because they are

3424
04:20:47,260 --> 04:20:49,260
Destructors they also

3425
04:20:49,260 --> 04:20:51,500
Stir up stir up the soil

3426
04:20:51,580 --> 04:20:57,420
So if we need natural fertilizer, you can like just straight up scoop it and shove it on a plant bed

3427
04:20:57,980 --> 04:20:59,980
Then it's pretty good

3428
04:21:00,060 --> 04:21:02,380
Your chicken was eaten by weasels weasels

3429
04:21:03,420 --> 04:21:08,940
Aren't weasels small aquatic animals that are like long like a noodle

3430
04:21:10,860 --> 04:21:13,180
A weasel are weasels, but what?

3431
04:21:14,300 --> 04:21:16,300
A weasel weasel

3432
04:21:17,900 --> 04:21:22,940
A little small on aqua a weasel yoink your chicken isn't the chicken bigger than the

3433
04:21:24,380 --> 04:21:26,380
Weasels are land based

3434
04:21:27,660 --> 04:21:29,660
Oh looks like a little noodle

3435
04:21:31,980 --> 04:21:33,980
That yoink to chicken

3436
04:21:34,460 --> 04:21:36,940
That thing can take down a chicken. It's tiny

3437
04:21:38,540 --> 04:21:41,180
Hold on. Let me pull up the picture. I'm looking at right now

3438
04:21:43,900 --> 04:21:47,500
Uh, they look toy they look like a pet

3439
04:21:49,740 --> 04:21:55,740
If I can pull up a picture anytime now, right hold on. Let's let's go be cheeky picture in

3440
04:21:58,220 --> 04:22:00,220
Hmm

3441
04:22:00,620 --> 04:22:02,620
This is what I see

3442
04:22:04,060 --> 04:22:07,820
This yoink to chicken this that yoink to chicken

3443
04:22:09,420 --> 04:22:11,420
It's tiny

3444
04:22:11,900 --> 04:22:13,900
Unless they're like a lot bigger than I imagine

3445
04:22:16,460 --> 04:22:22,140
Weasels are deadly shut up. These are deadly animals. Look at the freaking look a cutie looks

3446
04:22:23,100 --> 04:22:28,860
I've been trolled humans can yoink ostriches. Oh, well you do actually have a point there hold on a minute

3447
04:22:28,940 --> 04:22:31,580
Hold on that reefland speaking the truth. Hold on pause

3448
04:22:35,820 --> 04:22:37,820
Okay

3449
04:22:41,820 --> 04:22:43,820
They're cute till they open their mouths

3450
04:22:45,660 --> 04:22:47,660
Is that like me a matty?

3451
04:22:47,740 --> 04:22:49,340
Yeah

3452
04:22:49,340 --> 04:22:51,340
Okay, maybe if it's like me a matty

3453
04:22:52,780 --> 04:22:58,300
They look like ferrets. That's not a thought. Do you read the red wall series? There's a reason weasels are the villains in it

3454
04:22:58,300 --> 04:23:00,700
No, I haven't read that actually. I don't know what it is

3455
04:23:02,540 --> 04:23:05,260
I don't know what red wall is but that's okay

3456
04:23:07,020 --> 04:23:08,460
Because I

3457
04:23:08,460 --> 04:23:13,420
Means I can experience media that you guys enjoy. No, you're cute even after opening your mouth

3458
04:23:13,420 --> 04:23:15,420
Hmm

3459
04:23:16,780 --> 04:23:23,500
Rod red wall was game of thrones for kids. That is hilarious as a description

3460
04:23:24,140 --> 04:23:26,140
um

3461
04:23:26,300 --> 04:23:31,660
Is there a cat in here or am I losing it? No, it's the heating. Sorry the heating's come on and it's moving the blind

3462
04:23:31,660 --> 04:23:35,580
And it makes me think that Vigo is on the window, but he's not

3463
04:23:37,580 --> 04:23:40,780
And before a cat jumps up on the table and I get heart attack of a lifetime

3464
04:23:41,340 --> 04:23:43,340
It's trying to you're cute when you open your dash straight

3465
04:23:44,700 --> 04:23:46,220
You're not

3466
04:23:46,220 --> 04:23:48,460
No, you're cute, especially when your mouth is open

3467
04:23:50,300 --> 04:23:52,300
Good

3468
04:23:52,300 --> 04:23:54,300
That's the way I like it

3469
04:23:57,980 --> 04:24:01,420
But yes, uh, I will try my best to

3470
04:24:02,060 --> 04:24:07,340
Actually properly update my youtube because now it looks all terribly wrong

3471
04:24:08,220 --> 04:24:15,900
But it's going to be bulk troll for two hours spout roll. Sorry for two hours. And then it's going to be

3472
04:24:17,820 --> 04:24:21,340
Um member stream for two hours and then that's a four hour day

3473
04:24:21,500 --> 04:24:25,420
Which means I might actually have the energy to edit and do all the things I need to do

3474
04:24:27,260 --> 04:24:29,260
um

3475
04:24:29,740 --> 04:24:31,740
I liked moss flower a lot

3476
04:24:31,820 --> 04:24:36,540
In moss flower there was an evil cat who had a bunch of mercenaries who taxed the forest animals and then

3477
04:24:37,420 --> 04:24:39,420
Other folk went and killed them

3478
04:24:40,220 --> 04:24:42,860
I should actually is robin hood

3479
04:24:44,380 --> 04:24:46,380
This is going to sound so silly

3480
04:24:47,500 --> 04:24:53,180
And if it is silly, it's okay. You can laugh is robin hood like um actually based on a novel that

3481
04:24:53,740 --> 04:24:55,740
and not just that disney tv show

3482
04:24:57,100 --> 04:24:58,780
um

3483
04:24:58,780 --> 04:25:00,780
Because if so

3484
04:25:00,860 --> 04:25:02,860
I'm here for robin hood not gonna lie

3485
04:25:03,660 --> 04:25:09,340
He actually kind of he had a few good points, you know take from the rich that I'll never even notice that that's gone

3486
04:25:10,220 --> 04:25:12,220
It is okay. Maybe we should read that

3487
04:25:13,180 --> 04:25:16,460
Would you replace hypnotica? There's a cuttlefish in the game. Oh

3488
04:25:17,740 --> 04:25:19,820
I might give it a cheeky shot. Um

3489
04:25:21,980 --> 04:25:26,380
I don't know how hard should I play the game blind or should I look up

3490
04:25:27,020 --> 04:25:27,820
gameplay

3491
04:25:27,820 --> 04:25:30,620
So I am not completely clueless

3492
04:25:31,020 --> 04:25:37,180
Because the reason I can play velcro on stream confidently is because I've seen someone play it play it blind

3493
04:25:37,420 --> 04:25:39,820
Play it blind blind. It's fine. Okay. I'll trust you

3494
04:25:40,780 --> 04:25:42,780
um

3495
04:25:43,020 --> 04:25:47,420
I will stick it near the end of july for subnautica

3496
04:25:48,140 --> 04:25:50,140
How about that deal?

3497
04:25:50,140 --> 04:25:53,820
Near the end of july we'll do a subnautica. I'll do it blind and

3498
04:25:54,780 --> 04:25:59,260
We'll see if my fish friends are going to be nice to me at all robin hood is not based on novel

3499
04:25:59,260 --> 04:26:02,380
He's a legendary figure in folk folk lore

3500
04:26:03,020 --> 04:26:07,180
The early stories about him dating back to 14th century were shared through oral traditions

3501
04:26:08,220 --> 04:26:10,220
I'm gonna share some oral traditions with me

3502
04:26:12,860 --> 04:26:16,620
Look I had to think about it on the spot. I couldn't change the sentence up that much

3503
04:26:16,700 --> 04:26:19,100
I mean I kind of lose its potency, you know

3504
04:26:20,140 --> 04:26:22,700
Oh, well, I will I try

3505
04:26:24,780 --> 04:26:26,780
Hmm

3506
04:26:29,740 --> 04:26:34,940
Well the character is in public domain is there a robin hood video game are you thinking that

3507
04:26:36,380 --> 04:26:39,340
Robin Hood, but it's a girl the classic twist

3508
04:26:39,980 --> 04:26:42,780
And then people get annoyed because it's gender changed

3509
04:26:42,780 --> 04:26:48,220
But actually it just brings more publicity and yet again we have fallen for the bruce of the marketing campaign

3510
04:26:50,380 --> 04:26:52,380
We can't escape it

3511
04:26:52,780 --> 04:26:54,780
Fools I tell you fills we are

3512
04:26:57,260 --> 04:27:01,020
Yeah, I'm sure you're skilled in oral traditions. Yeah, I want to find out

3513
04:27:02,700 --> 04:27:04,700
I think I'm doing

3514
04:27:06,780 --> 04:27:08,780
I can't remember what me fucking

3515
04:27:09,900 --> 04:27:12,300
Audio supposed to be that comes out tomorrow

3516
04:27:14,220 --> 04:27:19,260
I can't believe I'm actually gonna have to wake up an hour early for stream so I can edit that and get it all ready to

3517
04:27:19,660 --> 04:27:23,020
Publish because I've not edited it yet because I'm a naughty naughty

3518
04:27:27,740 --> 04:27:31,820
Are we talking about that and fire entire fate franchise fate

3519
04:27:33,580 --> 04:27:43,100
Oh my gosh, we're in the 49,000s. We're no longer in the 50,000. Let's go Omri five. Let's go. Sorry. I timed out because I was reading

3520
04:27:43,340 --> 04:27:44,860
Hey

3521
04:27:44,860 --> 04:27:51,900
Congratulations, you just advanced the cooking level. You just advanced our cooking level your cooking level is 85. Let's

3522
04:27:52,780 --> 04:27:54,780
Go. This was my goal

3523
04:27:55,180 --> 04:27:59,580
for today's stream and we did it. I wanted 85

3524
04:28:02,620 --> 04:28:04,940
I'd be self plenty of time for Azor to come along

3525
04:28:05,660 --> 04:28:07,900
You're now a quarter of the weight in a night. Don't

3526
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:11,260
see such heinous things in my presence

3527
04:28:12,220 --> 04:28:13,660
I am

3528
04:28:13,660 --> 04:28:17,180
Look, if there's any doubters, I'm gonna be honest. I'm doubting a little bit

3529
04:28:17,660 --> 04:28:22,060
We'll see what happens by the end of the movie marathons

3530
04:28:23,420 --> 04:28:25,420
and

3531
04:28:25,420 --> 04:28:29,020
If the movie marathons are fine, we'll see where we are

3532
04:28:30,140 --> 04:28:33,660
But you're making me nervous saying that I'm only one fourth of a way there

3533
04:28:34,300 --> 04:28:37,260
I'm getting a bit shaky and not the good kind because I'm like

3534
04:28:37,980 --> 04:28:39,340
bruh

3535
04:28:39,340 --> 04:28:41,340
This is insane endurance

3536
04:28:42,300 --> 04:28:44,300
I'm not sure like if

3537
04:28:45,100 --> 04:28:48,380
If I finish this batch of 49,000, right?

3538
04:28:50,300 --> 04:28:52,700
Surely that's my 99, right?

3539
04:28:56,060 --> 04:29:00,700
That's 99 if I finish these wine. Yes, you'll be done. Okay

3540
04:29:02,220 --> 04:29:06,140
Okay, I have faith because we started at 53,000

3541
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:10,540
And we're already in 49 so I have a bit more faith now

3542
04:29:12,140 --> 04:29:18,940
I'm getting my resolve tested roughly 48,000 needs to be done. Right. Okay. If it's 48,000

3543
04:29:19,580 --> 04:29:21,820
I can I can do it. Okay

3544
04:29:23,260 --> 04:29:24,780
Give me one

3545
04:29:24,780 --> 04:29:30,460
Endurance stream where we watch video games where we watch movies whilst we do this then I think we can do it

3546
04:29:30,460 --> 04:29:33,740
I don't know. Maybe there'll be two back-to-back like movie streams

3547
04:29:34,460 --> 04:29:39,340
Just so I don't have to think and I could be like, uh, grape goes in water jug

3548
04:29:41,340 --> 04:29:43,740
Movie on the bunga basically

3549
04:29:44,860 --> 04:29:46,540
um

3550
04:29:46,540 --> 04:29:49,660
For meme ASMR just read the wiki page on the kingdoms of scotland

3551
04:29:51,260 --> 04:29:55,980
Yes, I am going to do a movie watch along the next time we play runescape

3552
04:29:55,980 --> 04:30:01,340
So I don't have to think basically and we'll see how much we clear in one of those streams

3553
04:30:01,740 --> 04:30:06,220
And we can just enjoy the movies for what they're worth copyright laws. Oh, no, no, no, no, no

3554
04:30:06,620 --> 04:30:09,500
You do not know how we do watch alongs in this house

3555
04:30:11,740 --> 04:30:17,900
We have a timestamp and you're gonna see where we are, but we do not get copyrighted in this house. I assure you

3556
04:30:20,300 --> 04:30:26,220
You'll just have to show up to the runescape stream to see what dastardly plans I have in order to do a watch along

3557
04:30:26,540 --> 04:30:28,540
Hmm

3558
04:30:28,860 --> 04:30:32,300
Blade runner or alien watch along strongly expected us to be mine

3559
04:30:32,380 --> 04:30:37,660
Little didn't know it's gonna be me. That's mine broken by the end of this honestly. I thought 99 cooking was easy

3560
04:30:38,300 --> 04:30:43,340
I'm sorry. I actually genuinely thought it was easy. I take it back. I take it all back. It's not easy. Oh, I hate this

3561
04:30:43,820 --> 04:30:45,500
Well, I don't hate it

3562
04:30:45,500 --> 04:30:47,500
I just I'm like

3563
04:30:47,500 --> 04:30:52,940
Feeling a bit overwhelmed because I'm like, oh my god. This is actually going to I can't believe it

3564
04:30:53,260 --> 04:30:58,940
I can't believe this achievement in runescape takes a while that barely any players have actually achieved

3565
04:31:00,220 --> 04:31:02,860
It's a free 99. Is that why it takes so long?

3566
04:31:03,660 --> 04:31:07,180
And before we could like swap to fletching and get it done when the day

3567
04:31:08,540 --> 04:31:09,900
That would uh

3568
04:31:09,900 --> 04:31:14,780
Actually be pretty hilarious. Just be like, all right. We'll do 99 fletch and write runescape series over when we got a 99

3569
04:31:14,860 --> 04:31:18,140
I'll take it. Cooking actually is one of the most common feels good, man

3570
04:31:19,100 --> 04:31:22,860
See everyone just wants to know how go do agility 99. Absolutely not

3571
04:31:23,580 --> 04:31:29,180
I don't know much about agility, but absolutely not. I know for a fact that's a nightmare one. I think

3572
04:31:30,700 --> 04:31:33,180
Is it rune crafting is a nightmare one as well?

3573
04:31:35,500 --> 04:31:36,940
I think

3574
04:31:36,940 --> 04:31:38,940
thieving if I recall correctly

3575
04:31:39,580 --> 04:31:47,420
Thieving is you pickpocket some guard from level 72 onwards. You just do the exact same thing for ages

3576
04:31:48,140 --> 04:31:53,020
I cannot believe this is what prime runescape gameplay is. I'm so sorry, but it actually is as well

3577
04:31:53,020 --> 04:31:55,020
Like it doesn't get better than this

3578
04:31:55,260 --> 04:32:00,460
It doesn't get better than looking into your inventory pulling stuff out putting it back in again

3579
04:32:01,260 --> 04:32:03,580
Mining is actually pretty bad. Hmm

3580
04:32:05,580 --> 04:32:09,980
Is wood cutting the only one that you can like actually or is it sand crabs?

3581
04:32:10,060 --> 04:32:13,500
Is it sand crabs you can afk like you're attacking damage on?

3582
04:32:14,140 --> 04:32:17,980
But you still do need to be on standby or something. I can't remember

3583
04:32:18,380 --> 04:32:23,100
I don't think there's any true afk like unless you count like hitting a tree

3584
04:32:23,820 --> 04:32:25,100
afk

3585
04:32:25,100 --> 04:32:27,100
um, I don't know

3586
04:32:27,100 --> 04:32:29,580
You can afk the knight in combat easy. Oh

3587
04:32:31,580 --> 04:32:35,740
Peak gaming, uh, I prefer pyramid plunder to arby knights, but each of their own

3588
04:32:36,460 --> 04:32:38,220
ardy knights

3589
04:32:38,220 --> 04:32:40,220
You can do alchemy

3590
04:32:43,500 --> 04:32:44,700
I

3591
04:32:44,700 --> 04:32:51,180
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think maybe once we hit 99 runescape. I'm definitely taking a big break from it

3592
04:32:51,260 --> 04:32:55,980
I do genuinely thoroughly enjoy the game. I wouldn't mind doing questing again

3593
04:32:56,060 --> 04:32:58,540
I actually thoroughly enjoyed doing the quest with everyone

3594
04:32:59,100 --> 04:33:00,060
and

3595
04:33:00,060 --> 04:33:05,500
I do not have much experience with the quest and plots so I wouldn't mind doing it like um

3596
04:33:06,220 --> 04:33:11,580
At some point, but I'm talking like this is probably august if we're gonna if we're gonna runescape 99 this

3597
04:33:12,060 --> 04:33:14,460
It's probably august until the next runescape

3598
04:33:15,420 --> 04:33:17,420
content comes out because

3599
04:33:17,900 --> 04:33:20,380
It's um, although the questing would be fun

3600
04:33:21,020 --> 04:33:25,820
You gotta go members request. The real question is without help at what point should we be, you know

3601
04:33:27,100 --> 04:33:30,700
If you didn't have help and did like if you

3602
04:33:33,180 --> 04:33:37,340
And you did like barbarians like salmon maybe if you did salmon

3603
04:33:37,340 --> 04:33:39,340
I

3604
04:33:39,740 --> 04:33:42,220
Mean if he did it whilst I was like streaming other games

3605
04:33:42,380 --> 04:33:48,300
You probably would be near the same level if not farther than me because I've just been grinding on other games

3606
04:33:48,380 --> 04:33:50,380
baby

3607
04:33:55,820 --> 04:33:58,860
I have grown so sleepy after eating all that food

3608
04:33:59,980 --> 04:34:03,500
I'm like man. I could really use a nap before this collab. I don't I don't want to

3609
04:34:04,460 --> 04:34:08,380
I don't want to I want to put make more progress towards my level

3610
04:34:10,060 --> 04:34:13,500
But then again if we're doing like 12 or a shift to watch movies then

3611
04:34:14,460 --> 04:34:16,620
It's not even a shift. Let's be honest

3612
04:34:17,420 --> 04:34:22,860
What did you do for your work today? I did backbreaking work stacking shelves was doing the chill

3613
04:34:23,260 --> 04:34:26,700
The tells had to like clean up like spillages and all that. What did you do?

3614
04:34:27,100 --> 04:34:32,140
Oh, I watched movies while leveling up on old school runescape. Oh

3615
04:34:33,100 --> 04:34:36,300
Like come on come on mate. Get real

3616
04:34:37,740 --> 04:34:44,300
New runescape is like 10 times easier, but the levels are go up to 120. Do they not which is like four times 99

3617
04:34:45,900 --> 04:34:47,900
Unless I'm misunderstanding

3618
04:34:48,860 --> 04:34:51,980
Well, you already reached your goal for today. Do you want us to tempt you to sleep?

3619
04:34:51,980 --> 04:34:57,500
Don't because I think I might actually take a nap. I'm like, well if I need to be full strength for

3620
04:34:58,380 --> 04:35:05,900
Mercy's collab. I'm like if I go how about if I take it to nine o'clock is she be gonna be on at nine or she be on now?

3621
04:35:07,980 --> 04:35:12,860
Oh, I don't want to I don't want to um be a silly billy

3622
04:35:16,620 --> 04:35:18,780
Naps kind of ruined my sleep she'd be live now

3623
04:35:18,780 --> 04:35:24,220
I know she's like, but she's gonna be alive for like another 30 minutes if I round it up to nine a.m

3624
04:35:24,220 --> 04:35:29,900
Which makes no sense for anyone not in my time zone if I round it up for another 25 minutes ish

3625
04:35:31,900 --> 04:35:33,100
Um

3626
04:35:33,100 --> 04:35:38,220
The modern version of the game you get a million xp an hour in the slayer skill and you can get like maybe 50 k an hour on here

3627
04:35:38,220 --> 04:35:40,220
Oh, wow

3628
04:35:40,300 --> 04:35:42,300
You are not messing around

3629
04:35:44,140 --> 04:35:46,140
You can sleep am I ask she be

3630
04:35:47,100 --> 04:35:49,100
Yeah, can um

3631
04:35:49,420 --> 04:35:54,060
Can someone be very kind and bump into she be streaming just say

3632
04:35:54,620 --> 04:35:59,580
Strongly wants to redirect to you in 20 minutes. Will you still be on question mark?

3633
04:36:00,540 --> 04:36:03,820
Uh, I will appreciate it if you notice someone else has already typed that message

3634
04:36:03,900 --> 04:36:08,300
Please don't spam or chat too much because I don't know. I don't know how in sync the reeflings are yet

3635
04:36:08,380 --> 04:36:14,460
I mean you guys are actually pretty in sync. You think you think that yesterday, which means pretty entertaining

3636
04:36:16,700 --> 04:36:18,700
Uh, yes

3637
04:36:20,300 --> 04:36:26,540
I am very tempted for a nap. I've eaten all that food and I'm like I'm unironically barely full of mead and

3638
04:36:27,180 --> 04:36:32,940
Like getting sleepy. This happened last time I played runescape. I think this is just such a like peaceful relaxing game

3639
04:36:33,820 --> 04:36:35,820
It looks like she's just chatting. She's

3640
04:36:36,700 --> 04:36:38,700
She said to late pee don't know

3641
04:36:39,500 --> 04:36:41,500
Give her a pee don't

3642
04:36:42,460 --> 04:36:46,460
So I can redirect into her in 20 minutes. She says probably till late. What's that mean?

3643
04:36:49,100 --> 04:36:51,100
Yes, or no she be a young in 20 minutes

3644
04:36:51,980 --> 04:36:53,260
Yes, I know

3645
04:36:53,260 --> 04:37:00,060
Tell me she be right. I'll take that as a yes. I'll just make sure I redirect and then I'm going for a nap

3646
04:37:03,100 --> 04:37:07,820
And where are you? Oh, Amy's playing with her palace at the level

3647
04:37:08,780 --> 04:37:14,140
Hopefully she's having a good stream together with her. I need to learn her name out of respect

3648
04:37:15,500 --> 04:37:21,900
I'm such a forgetful. Well, she hasn't even started the game yet. Oh, she's not even started. Oh, okay. That's hilarious

3649
04:37:21,900 --> 04:37:30,380
Yeah, I'll it's safe to redirect into sheepsters. Um, right. We will do our 20 more minutes of wines

3650
04:37:31,100 --> 04:37:34,060
and then I'm going to be a cheeky sod and go for a nap and

3651
04:37:34,300 --> 04:37:35,420
uh

3652
04:37:35,420 --> 04:37:39,020
Wake up. Maybe I can edit an ASMR in time. Um

3653
04:37:39,820 --> 04:37:45,580
But my eye, I kid you not my eyes are like, um, yeah sleep sleep. I love sleep. That's a yappy dome

3654
04:37:46,620 --> 04:37:50,620
It's very easy and at 90 if you do members trees, you can afk for like 20 minutes at a time

3655
04:37:50,620 --> 04:37:52,620
Tastes like two weeks more though. Ah, okay

3656
04:37:53,900 --> 04:37:55,900
It's afk though, it's good

3657
04:37:57,020 --> 04:38:02,700
Oh, I need to pee pee because I actually put liquids in my body for once

3658
04:38:04,060 --> 04:38:08,380
I can't believe it. I can't believe hydrating means that you have to pee. It's a terrible cycle

3659
04:38:08,940 --> 04:38:14,780
Terrific one. Wow, this has been four hours. Yes. Sorry if you had anything important to do

3660
04:38:16,620 --> 04:38:18,620
Hope I haven't distracted you too much

3661
04:38:21,820 --> 04:38:24,940
Because I'll level in over here or just stand on a boot

3662
04:38:25,500 --> 04:38:30,060
I assume the the reeflings that stand about like outside have already achieved these kind of things

3663
04:38:30,780 --> 04:38:32,940
And they're just like them just happy to be here

3664
04:38:34,140 --> 04:38:37,180
Because you could be level enough casually on the side, you never know

3665
04:38:42,140 --> 04:38:45,580
You'll be eeping. Don't worry the collab vods will stay up. Um

3666
04:38:47,420 --> 04:38:49,980
Mersey doesn't have a warning. She's actually been very good

3667
04:38:50,540 --> 04:38:54,700
YouTube has not given mersey a warning so I have faith that the vod will not be taken down

3668
04:38:55,340 --> 04:38:58,300
Um, and like I don't really see anything too outrageous

3669
04:38:59,260 --> 04:39:03,820
My main account got wiped. I'm giving up on runescape. Oh, no

3670
04:39:05,580 --> 04:39:09,740
How does an account get wiped if it got hacked they reset it but give you it all back?

3671
04:39:10,780 --> 04:39:12,780
Like they reset the stats

3672
04:39:15,100 --> 04:39:18,060
I don't even know how you'd wipe an account. I don't like your bank, I guess

3673
04:39:19,820 --> 04:39:21,580
Hmm

3674
04:39:21,580 --> 04:39:26,060
Brand new account because of you. No, I'm in it. You're in it too deep. Yeah, I got resets

3675
04:39:26,700 --> 04:39:29,660
I mean, they should get your name back though, but that sucks

3676
04:39:33,180 --> 04:39:39,740
That's all right, our say so cool. Hi, literally mersey the goodest girl. She's like the one I don't have to worry about ever getting banned

3677
04:39:41,100 --> 04:39:44,620
She's just so good. I bet you she does come out with some stuff. I just have no clue because

3678
04:39:45,420 --> 04:39:47,420
when she streams is

3679
04:39:47,500 --> 04:39:51,740
I can catch icy in the morning if I wake up before streams, but recently I've been waking up

3680
04:39:52,700 --> 04:39:56,060
Oh, I was up so late last night waiting for this

3681
04:39:56,540 --> 04:40:02,940
Fuck and file to upload so I can send it to the editor to test her out and see if we're a good fit for each other

3682
04:40:03,660 --> 04:40:07,500
I sent her a women joke. So I hope she doesn't get offended by it

3683
04:40:08,060 --> 04:40:10,300
someone clipped me in the

3684
04:40:11,260 --> 04:40:13,260
legend is Zelda stream

3685
04:40:13,420 --> 04:40:15,660
And so someone was like, oh those

3686
04:40:16,460 --> 04:40:20,860
Those rope jewels always freaked me out as a child because they just take your money or something

3687
04:40:21,340 --> 04:40:23,500
And ask it in the way they read it

3688
04:40:23,820 --> 04:40:27,420
The way they said it was like something along the lines of and then I went oh

3689
04:40:27,580 --> 04:40:29,740
Isn't that just what women are or something like that?

3690
04:40:30,220 --> 04:40:36,860
And I sent the joke. So if I get fired as a commission, I know what I know what a clip was the one too far

3691
04:40:40,460 --> 04:40:45,020
Yeah, someone clipped it and I was like, oh, you know what turn that into a joke and I'll see what happens

3692
04:40:45,500 --> 04:40:47,500
and

3693
04:40:47,580 --> 04:40:52,060
To I explained like oh, this is what the enemy looks like in the video game. That was me

3694
04:40:52,700 --> 04:40:58,780
Yeah, well, I can see your clips. I'm not kidding your clips helped out like I went through my clips and I had a few more to send over

3695
04:40:59,420 --> 04:41:07,580
I sent an audio clip of a someone in the other stream was like, oh, you cannae you cannae clap

3696
04:41:08,780 --> 04:41:11,740
Your cheeks basically and then like I stood up and instantly did it

3697
04:41:12,220 --> 04:41:14,700
I've sent that to be edited in a clip

3698
04:41:14,780 --> 04:41:20,220
So I don't know if this chick's going to be running for the hills when she realized what I've asked her to make for me

3699
04:41:20,620 --> 04:41:23,980
Or if she's like going to be like solid and be like, oh, this is hilarious for me

3700
04:41:24,380 --> 04:41:29,260
Because it's probably quite drastically different from like the regular stuff she gets commissioned for

3701
04:41:29,900 --> 04:41:32,700
And I'm just like, oh, here's me. Here's an audio sound of my

3702
04:41:34,220 --> 04:41:40,540
Basically as I I stand up like it's so silly. So either she'll be down or she won't but she's Aussie so

3703
04:41:40,780 --> 04:41:42,780
I don't actually

3704
04:41:43,100 --> 04:41:44,380
um

3705
04:41:44,380 --> 04:41:47,900
Expect any issues because Aussies are pretty humorous

3706
04:41:48,300 --> 04:41:52,780
Uh got pretty good humor not the clip of the being the boy you're cute

3707
04:41:54,060 --> 04:41:56,060
I wouldn't edit it be like that's cheeky

3708
04:41:56,940 --> 04:42:00,300
And it probably goes through so many emotions when receiving the videos. Yeah

3709
04:42:01,500 --> 04:42:05,340
Uh Aussie internet is terrible. I uploaded

3710
04:42:06,060 --> 04:42:08,380
and

3711
04:42:08,380 --> 04:42:11,980
So, you know youtube shorts. So take mercy shorts, for example

3712
04:42:12,220 --> 04:42:15,980
I have to send off what is known as an mov file, which is

3713
04:42:16,460 --> 04:42:22,940
A full transparent file off to the editor the problem with mov files. They are absolutely

3714
04:42:23,740 --> 04:42:29,100
Humongous for no reason and no need now. I know you might say why don't you use green screen?

3715
04:42:30,540 --> 04:42:35,820
Look at the color of my hair in my outfit. Why don't I use green screen? Don't ever talk to me again. It's such

3716
04:42:36,460 --> 04:42:38,460
useless and I'm just gonna um

3717
04:42:39,500 --> 04:42:43,340
So it's just easier to send mov files like emmy for example

3718
04:42:43,420 --> 04:42:48,700
You say, huh emmy emmy can use a green screen actually emmy can't she has a green jewel on her necklace

3719
04:42:48,940 --> 04:42:57,100
Can't use green screen. Anyway, so I it was like 7 p.m. I was getting 8 p.m. I'm waiting for this file to upload

3720
04:42:57,180 --> 04:43:02,140
I'm like please upload so I can send this per chicken audio of me clapping without my hands

3721
04:43:02,860 --> 04:43:04,460
I was getting

3722
04:43:04,460 --> 04:43:10,220
Exhausted and I was like I'm gonna have me fucking sleep and me energy for runescape and then obviously as soon as I came online

3723
04:43:10,300 --> 04:43:17,340
I'm like, hi guys like I have all the energy in the world. I kid you know, I leech energy from refunds. It's true because seriously

3724
04:43:18,380 --> 04:43:21,900
Billy more, you know blue screen exists too. What's blue screen?

3725
04:43:23,180 --> 04:43:26,700
What if I tell you that you can't clap will you give us another demonstration? No

3726
04:43:27,340 --> 04:43:29,340
I have to only do once

3727
04:43:29,340 --> 04:43:30,380
Cheeky

3728
04:43:30,380 --> 04:43:37,020
Um, I sent away five like pre-made edit shorts type things and then I sent away like seven

3729
04:43:37,420 --> 04:43:44,220
Stream clips that I thought were mildly humorous two of them might not be able to be turned into a clip due to the nature of them

3730
04:43:44,300 --> 04:43:52,380
just like some moments are funny on stream, but they cannot be translated into a youtube short because there's not enough context

3731
04:43:52,380 --> 04:43:56,220
There's not enough time and you're limited to less than 59 seconds

3732
04:43:56,380 --> 04:44:00,620
Basically less than a minute. Sorry blue screen is like green screen, but blue. Oh

3733
04:44:01,500 --> 04:44:06,620
Sorry, I understand what you're saying. Yes. No, I don't know what you mean, but like it's just

3734
04:44:07,020 --> 04:44:10,140
MOV files are just to go to the the easiest to

3735
04:44:11,660 --> 04:44:18,700
Thingy, but anyway, I got it sent off is the long and short of it. Um, and I got pretty poor sleep unfortunately

3736
04:44:19,660 --> 04:44:20,540
Oh

3737
04:44:20,540 --> 04:44:26,540
Cuz I didn't get my my full eight hours. Oh, no. I didn't get ever sleep. I'm a little by me

3738
04:44:26,940 --> 04:44:31,980
And as much as I'd like for you to visit with Jeremy don't come here the internet quality and price are horrible. Oh

3739
04:44:33,020 --> 04:44:38,900
My dad went to Berlin and he absolutely loved it. And he was wanting to go back to Berlin

3740
04:44:38,900 --> 04:44:43,260
I might be doing a Europe tour with my dad on ironic clue. Um

3741
04:44:43,660 --> 04:44:44,780
Um

3742
04:44:44,780 --> 04:44:51,660
It depends what happens next year. Um, my dad might officially be retiring depending on if

3743
04:44:53,980 --> 04:44:57,500
You know if I do you're done basically paying for his retirement long story short

3744
04:44:57,900 --> 04:45:02,620
Um, but I was wanting to celebrate it if he does retire and I was like

3745
04:45:03,180 --> 04:45:05,180
Do you want to go on a european tour?

3746
04:45:05,420 --> 04:45:12,300
Because my dad likes traveling around europe like he really likes the multiculturalism of all even though

3747
04:45:12,300 --> 04:45:14,780
He cannot speak speak a lick of any

3748
04:45:14,940 --> 04:45:16,220
Um

3749
04:45:16,220 --> 04:45:21,020
He cannot speak a lick of any of the languages nor does he bother. He's like the oh

3750
04:45:21,340 --> 04:45:22,860
He my dad is polite as anything

3751
04:45:22,860 --> 04:45:23,900
He's like, oh, hello

3752
04:45:23,900 --> 04:45:28,220
And then he'll point to the menu with a smile on his face and doesn't say anything else and I was like, oh, okay

3753
04:45:28,300 --> 04:45:29,420
okay, dad

3754
04:45:29,420 --> 04:45:30,700
um

3755
04:45:30,700 --> 04:45:37,020
But uh, he wants to go back to germany. So I might actually be in germany at one point to be crazy

3756
04:45:37,980 --> 04:45:42,700
Congrats on whoever loved it. I also came back after I love you and break just to watch the call fish

3757
04:45:43,420 --> 04:45:45,820
I'm dragging yous back into the runescape home

3758
04:45:46,860 --> 04:45:52,220
Probs are proud dad. Yeah, he wants to go to berlin because he loved it. I absolutely loved it

3759
04:45:53,100 --> 04:45:57,500
I can't remember what mom and dad did in berlin though. No before anyone makes any jokes

3760
04:45:59,180 --> 04:46:04,380
I don't want to know what my parents get up to when they're alone in a foreign city. I do not want to know

3761
04:46:05,180 --> 04:46:06,620
Um

3762
04:46:06,620 --> 04:46:10,780
I think they did like the classic tourism stuff in berlin. I don't know

3763
04:46:11,580 --> 04:46:13,580
If they went anywhere

3764
04:46:13,900 --> 04:46:17,100
Because I think my mom's pal came along as well. I'm just trying to remember

3765
04:46:18,460 --> 04:46:23,500
But my mom and my mom's pal went off to go visit some of the

3766
04:46:24,700 --> 04:46:27,900
a monuments like, um

3767
04:46:29,180 --> 04:46:31,420
Outfits and that just to like get all the

3768
04:46:32,380 --> 04:46:35,820
Cause like you can go see like all this the stuff and that

3769
04:46:36,220 --> 04:46:40,620
Um, I think my dad was just alone in the city and he went away for some food and that and the thingy

3770
04:46:40,940 --> 04:46:45,180
And just like laughing at the thought of my dad being alone being like, I love you guys

3771
04:46:45,820 --> 04:46:47,820
God and yeah

3772
04:46:48,060 --> 04:46:52,460
A bit of ironing like uh, uh the thought of my dad trying to speak german of

3773
04:46:53,900 --> 04:47:00,060
Why berlin is the ugliest city? Well, let's say it's where the tourists go and I mean there's all is it's very easily accessible

3774
04:47:00,060 --> 04:47:05,980
It's very, uh, English-ified as well for tourists and you have to understand tourists like familiarity

3775
04:47:06,060 --> 04:47:09,820
So if there's a place that's like, oh, there's got English things about they're gonna be want to go there, you know

3776
04:47:11,660 --> 04:47:13,660
Uh, oh god

3777
04:47:13,980 --> 04:47:15,740
Spotted in europe

3778
04:47:15,740 --> 04:47:21,660
Well, there is the possibility of like going to italy because I want to go and see

3779
04:47:22,300 --> 04:47:24,300
Roma and I want to go see

3780
04:47:25,180 --> 04:47:28,380
Uh venice all because of assassins creed. Yes. I said it

3781
04:47:28,380 --> 04:47:35,180
Yes, I want to go to roma and assassin's creed and uh venice for assassin's creed

3782
04:47:35,420 --> 04:47:40,140
No, I don't care if that makes me some weeb gamer. I don't give a shit. I want to see it. I want to see it

3783
04:47:41,420 --> 04:47:43,420
um

3784
04:47:43,420 --> 04:47:45,420
Going to hamburger to eat the first hamburger

3785
04:47:45,420 --> 04:47:49,340
I don't know if the girls are trying to convince me to come to america. Like I'll do it for them

3786
04:47:51,180 --> 04:47:57,980
Because azura was like I can't I was at azure sheebie one of them was like, oh, I'll take you out to like either

3787
04:47:58,060 --> 04:48:02,540
I'll take you out or I'll make you like a decent. I think azure is actually like a decent cook

3788
04:48:02,780 --> 04:48:06,140
I can't remember. I might be a zura. I might just be making that up and I'm going to get sprang

3789
04:48:06,540 --> 04:48:08,540
most likely the last option

3790
04:48:08,540 --> 04:48:10,300
um

3791
04:48:10,300 --> 04:48:13,980
Germans also don't like speaking german. Yeah, if you go to germany visit

3792
04:48:15,980 --> 04:48:22,060
It's basically a disney castello. Oh my feature revealer. You are an anime girl on the internet. You are the weeb. Ah

3793
04:48:22,860 --> 04:48:24,860
I always say I'm a gamer over a weeb

3794
04:48:25,260 --> 04:48:26,140
and

3795
04:48:26,140 --> 04:48:33,980
Like azura her freaking anime knowledge is like limitless. Holy crap. I'm like, uh, I just play expo 360 games to be honest

3796
04:48:33,980 --> 04:48:37,260
And I'm stuck on the nostalgia of them because I like familiarity

3797
04:48:38,060 --> 04:48:43,500
Uh, although saying that and each of her means I get to like try games for the new time

3798
04:48:43,580 --> 04:48:49,180
Like I will not stop talking about it buckshot relay and needy streamer overload

3799
04:48:49,580 --> 04:48:53,900
These kind of games that are actually smaller in length are so

3800
04:48:55,420 --> 04:48:56,460
um

3801
04:48:56,460 --> 04:49:00,060
Appeasing to the streamer profile if you will

3802
04:49:00,860 --> 04:49:07,660
It's why I'm interested in producing games that are roughly no more than four hours in length like wrap it up

3803
04:49:08,220 --> 04:49:11,020
Wrap it up. I don't I don't want to be playing the same game for like ages

3804
04:49:11,500 --> 04:49:13,500
I think it is very uh

3805
04:49:13,660 --> 04:49:18,540
Obtainable to streamers kind of this four hour thingy, which is why I came up with a cookie clicker game

3806
04:49:18,860 --> 04:49:22,140
That's actually completable. Um, if you didn't know they're

3807
04:49:22,860 --> 04:49:27,740
Uh, the the the og cookie clicker game. Um, it's not completable

3808
04:49:28,220 --> 04:49:34,060
Um within four hours unless, you know, wall hacks are on are you doing 360 noscopes through the map?

3809
04:49:34,700 --> 04:49:35,820
um

3810
04:49:35,820 --> 04:49:39,980
Which is why I concepted a game for the first time in my life like that

3811
04:49:40,540 --> 04:49:41,500
um

3812
04:49:41,500 --> 04:49:47,580
Obviously making via lures games kind of giving me a bit of an insight of what happens, but the reality is I've been very hands off

3813
04:49:47,660 --> 04:49:50,060
I just explained what I wanted and what I needed

3814
04:49:50,620 --> 04:49:56,700
Um and paid for it. Um, I ordered the artwork and stuff. I got some I got an artist that was comfortable with all body types

3815
04:49:56,860 --> 04:49:57,740
um

3816
04:49:57,740 --> 04:49:59,740
mersey actually previewed

3817
04:50:00,140 --> 04:50:02,140
her scene artwork

3818
04:50:02,220 --> 04:50:05,180
If you want to check out mersey's alt, um

3819
04:50:06,700 --> 04:50:10,940
It's currently getting animated right now and then I need to cut up everyone's voices

3820
04:50:11,500 --> 04:50:14,140
And then the game's pretty much ready to ship. Um

3821
04:50:14,780 --> 04:50:18,540
Wait, I don't know how long this animator is going to take. I do not know the animator

3822
04:50:18,620 --> 04:50:24,220
They were outsourced by the developer for me because I didn't have anyone that did this kind of thing

3823
04:50:25,340 --> 04:50:30,780
Um, but it's been a fantastic learning experience behind the scenes of being like I want this I want that

3824
04:50:30,860 --> 04:50:35,820
I will do this you do that and then we just you know and came together with the games there. Um

3825
04:50:36,620 --> 04:50:38,620
Our save file is a thing in this game

3826
04:50:39,580 --> 04:50:41,580
And the VLR game no you don't need a

3827
04:50:42,860 --> 04:50:44,860
Oh, there is actually

3828
04:50:45,980 --> 04:50:48,540
You get rewarded if you replay the game

3829
04:50:50,300 --> 04:50:55,500
I I specifically wanted a 20 minute experience. I think it's maybe each round

3830
04:50:56,060 --> 04:50:59,580
Like finish it. I think it takes like 30 minutes to go over like the

3831
04:51:00,540 --> 04:51:02,540
to finalize the

3832
04:51:02,860 --> 04:51:06,540
Situation I want to be vague on purpose because I don't want to spoil it

3833
04:51:07,100 --> 04:51:10,300
Um, but the more you replay it the more you can unlock

3834
04:51:11,580 --> 04:51:16,220
Something and not scenes you have access to all of the scenes right off the bat

3835
04:51:16,860 --> 04:51:18,860
If you through your first playthrough

3836
04:51:18,940 --> 04:51:23,340
But for people who enjoyed it or just want to see you know what the other stuff is

3837
04:51:23,820 --> 04:51:30,380
There is a small amount of replayability. Um, and it was a bit important to have a bit of replayability because

3838
04:51:30,780 --> 04:51:34,300
Um, yeah, no one I mean 30 minutes and then you're done. I mean

3839
04:51:34,940 --> 04:51:36,060
Yeah

3840
04:51:36,060 --> 04:51:38,700
Can you save in the game? I assume so

3841
04:51:39,900 --> 04:51:43,100
Uh, the game is free to play but I think you can save your progress

3842
04:51:43,100 --> 04:51:46,380
So if you are looking forward to a certain

3843
04:51:47,100 --> 04:51:54,140
Scene or animation with one of your favorite girly pops from velour then uh, yes, I believe you can access that right away

3844
04:51:54,780 --> 04:51:56,620
um

3845
04:51:56,620 --> 04:51:58,620
Resident evil you think I play

3846
04:51:59,580 --> 04:52:05,020
It do you know it cost millions to develop these kind of games you think I had millions in my back pocket

3847
04:52:05,100 --> 04:52:10,220
No, it's a free to access game. I've got cute little artwork to go with it

3848
04:52:11,740 --> 04:52:16,540
Girls are voice acted at the cost through this much like okay. Can you save in game? I don't know

3849
04:52:17,340 --> 04:52:19,340
Was there a hoon for it? I don't know

3850
04:52:19,980 --> 04:52:22,540
I really need a pee but I'm about to end stream

3851
04:52:23,420 --> 04:52:29,660
Ah, I can't believe it the peeler allegations. Oh, I can't do it. I actually really need a tinkle now that I know

3852
04:52:29,660 --> 04:52:31,660
All right. I've got eight minutes. I can hold on

3853
04:52:32,380 --> 04:52:37,740
Oh my god, it's not pee. It's a two. Oh, it's both. It's both at the same time. I'm not gonna make it

3854
04:52:39,020 --> 04:52:41,340
So you're super excited millions of gp

3855
04:52:42,460 --> 04:52:47,980
You don't have millions. How are you gonna buy the castello? Um, I'm gonna work for it

3856
04:52:48,940 --> 04:52:53,820
I will I'm gonna work hard for it. I need to pay my ASMR debts

3857
04:52:53,820 --> 04:52:59,180
I need to pay my ASMR collab debts because there's three girls still waiting on my dang edit and I do apologize

3858
04:53:00,060 --> 04:53:02,140
But I did record my lines, which is the best part

3859
04:53:04,300 --> 04:53:06,620
Pixely rpgs games remind me of

3860
04:53:07,740 --> 04:53:11,820
Wow pixel games. Oh, that's so cool. What pixel? Oh

3861
04:53:13,100 --> 04:53:15,100
pixel

3862
04:53:15,180 --> 04:53:17,180
Pixel oh, that's amazing

3863
04:53:18,860 --> 04:53:20,860
Hint hint cough cough nudge nudge

3864
04:53:22,540 --> 04:53:25,020
For the gameplay. Anyway, not the actual art. Um

3865
04:53:26,300 --> 04:53:28,300
Working on things in this economy

3866
04:53:29,340 --> 04:53:31,340
No, I say we steal a castello

3867
04:53:32,620 --> 04:53:39,100
Well, we just steal castello santian. We can live in italy surely are the lines fairtile in italy

3868
04:53:40,060 --> 04:53:46,700
Shawnee take the mic where you go. No, not yet. As I said, azura has to pass the baton to me if azura doesn't pass the baton

3869
04:53:47,660 --> 04:53:53,340
I can I am confirming or denying the aligank the aligankies the aligankies um

3870
04:53:54,380 --> 04:53:56,380
of peeler

3871
04:53:57,260 --> 04:53:59,260
Uh

3872
04:53:59,980 --> 04:54:04,780
Working on things in this. I know I need to work hard. She works hard for the money

3873
04:54:05,820 --> 04:54:07,020
and

3874
04:54:07,020 --> 04:54:10,060
I need to do azura and ac script next

3875
04:54:10,220 --> 04:54:15,020
That's probably one of my top priorities because I want everyone to be 5k by the end of this month

3876
04:54:16,860 --> 04:54:18,860
um

3877
04:54:18,860 --> 04:54:20,860
And at least 5k

3878
04:54:22,940 --> 04:54:28,140
I'll see what happens if I can get some editors to do some clips of the girls and fart some money into them

3879
04:54:28,140 --> 04:54:30,140
But me me editors they're gone

3880
04:54:30,940 --> 04:54:35,500
All of them are like one of them's like i'm sick other ones like uh, I've got in real life stuff

3881
04:54:35,660 --> 04:54:39,020
Other ones let my pc just fucking explode and i'm like, okay. Thanks. Um

3882
04:54:40,780 --> 04:54:43,820
We're getting hints. I feel so special and sorry for all the rooflings out here

3883
04:54:44,300 --> 04:54:47,820
I always give like a little peeper preview or something in between streams

3884
04:54:47,820 --> 04:54:53,980
It's just as a a special thank you for like listening in because I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea type thing. Um

3885
04:54:54,860 --> 04:55:00,940
But uh, thank you for tolerating me. Here's some insider knowledge that you everyone gets to know about in about a month's time

3886
04:55:02,380 --> 04:55:07,660
You know, I can't I can't stop yapping and releasing all my projects. Okay. I just get so excited

3887
04:55:08,780 --> 04:55:10,780
Man, I'm a lot of excitement for my project

3888
04:55:14,060 --> 04:55:16,700
They're all lying. They're all gonna play elton ring. I'm calling it now

3889
04:55:18,700 --> 04:55:20,700
Wait, who's playing elton ring the girls?

3890
04:55:22,140 --> 04:55:24,860
Or did I misunderstand? I mean I misunderstood your message

3891
04:55:25,820 --> 04:55:28,220
That's a very high probability. Thank you for tolerating me

3892
04:55:29,500 --> 04:55:32,140
A month it's so close. Yeah, the the game

3893
04:55:33,180 --> 04:55:36,300
The game production started in february all the everything's there

3894
04:55:36,380 --> 04:55:39,820
We're just waiting on the animation sequence because there's an animation scene

3895
04:55:40,540 --> 04:55:42,540
when you

3896
04:55:44,540 --> 04:55:46,700
Uh, complete the objective

3897
04:55:47,420 --> 04:55:52,060
Um, I think I almost just spoiled the game there. You know that. Um

3898
04:55:53,740 --> 04:55:55,740
Yes, when you

3899
04:55:56,620 --> 04:56:02,940
Do the mission objective? Yep, that's fine to say. Uh, you unlock a scene with a girl

3900
04:56:04,220 --> 04:56:06,220
And you take it from there

3901
04:56:08,060 --> 04:56:11,020
You take it from there you do that now you play one handed

3902
04:56:11,980 --> 04:56:15,180
Um, I'll be very surprised

3903
04:56:17,020 --> 04:56:21,420
Uh, yeah, it's unfortunate how many editors are in disposed as

3904
04:56:23,020 --> 04:56:25,020
scottles lunches

3905
04:56:25,100 --> 04:56:26,780
Yeah

3906
04:56:26,780 --> 04:56:33,580
As a game dev myself, is it cool if I attempt to you can absolutely make a fan game. No problems at all. Um

3907
04:56:34,540 --> 04:56:40,940
I honestly don't I don't I don't know why all these fucking companies have so many rules as long as it's not like derogatory

3908
04:56:41,180 --> 04:56:43,340
Or you're saying shite about the girls like

3909
04:56:45,020 --> 04:56:47,980
It's all good. All your editors are playing elden ring right now. Oh

3910
04:56:49,100 --> 04:56:51,100
probably

3911
04:56:51,500 --> 04:56:54,460
I'll actually have like three guys have a new guy on board. Um

3912
04:56:56,780 --> 04:56:58,780
And just like

3913
04:56:59,740 --> 04:57:02,780
It takes a while, but I'll see how I go with my

3914
04:57:03,820 --> 04:57:10,220
Me me me Aussie editor my girl editor. Actually, I wouldn't mind talking about her on stream if she's comfortable with it

3915
04:57:10,220 --> 04:57:13,420
That sounds really weird though. Hey, can I talk about you on stream?

3916
04:57:15,020 --> 04:57:17,020
The way you edit my clips

3917
04:57:19,660 --> 04:57:23,420
So, okay. All right, you freak give me a moment. Just pay me the money. I'll shut up

3918
04:57:28,780 --> 04:57:30,780
Oh

3919
04:57:35,020 --> 04:57:40,460
No, it's Johnny spoil in the ending. What tries you to someone no, it's not even the ending. There's like there's rounds

3920
04:57:41,580 --> 04:57:47,660
There's rounds and you got pick you gotta pick the girl and there's rounds and if you succeed in your mission objective

3921
04:57:47,740 --> 04:57:49,740
You get to

3922
04:57:51,020 --> 04:57:54,940
Um, there's also it's not really hidden dialogue

3923
04:57:55,020 --> 04:58:01,020
But you can pick the girls in a different order and you'll hear a different line depending on what order you pick them in

3924
04:58:01,180 --> 04:58:03,180
but it's not like a

3925
04:58:03,260 --> 04:58:05,100
Oh, there's like super hidden

3926
04:58:05,100 --> 04:58:09,660
Crazy lore. It's like no you you won't hear that sentence unless you pick that girl in that sequence

3927
04:58:09,820 --> 04:58:12,700
It's that kind of thing. You don't actually miss out on anything and then

3928
04:58:15,980 --> 04:58:21,820
Um for the ending scene unfortunately the ending scene didn't go the way I wanted it to fucked up

3929
04:58:21,980 --> 04:58:23,980
Um

3930
04:58:24,620 --> 04:58:28,940
But it's all good in the hood. I actually think it's quite adorable. I think you guys will like it rounds like pokemon

3931
04:58:30,140 --> 04:58:34,460
Rounds no, no not like strategy turn base. It's a freak. Yes, boys. Go

3932
04:58:35,340 --> 04:58:38,460
It's trying to break in NDAs motherfucker. I am the NDA

3933
04:58:40,540 --> 04:58:42,140
No, I don't even

3934
04:58:42,140 --> 04:58:47,740
There was a contract signed with the game developer unfortunately because of how much money was passing through the hands

3935
04:58:48,700 --> 04:58:54,220
Um, but I mean it's all I mean everything I've seen what I've seen all looks good to me. Um

3936
04:58:55,580 --> 04:58:59,820
I think mersey's name is actually wrong in the video game right now and I need to tell them

3937
04:59:01,420 --> 04:59:03,180
It's not karam

3938
04:59:03,180 --> 04:59:10,300
I I told you that mersey's name got changed very late in development. It's very possible right now. She's called karam in the game

3939
04:59:11,580 --> 04:59:13,580
I need to check in with the game dev actually

3940
04:59:13,660 --> 04:59:16,940
I've just been running out of time everywhere like everywhere I have ran out of time

3941
04:59:17,340 --> 04:59:23,500
And I'm like it'll settle soon and it will settle soon. I just need to get to the stage where it settles soon

3942
04:59:23,580 --> 04:59:26,380
I'm just not there yet. Like once um

3943
04:59:27,260 --> 04:59:29,740
Especially when my dad comes and sees me

3944
04:59:30,460 --> 04:59:34,060
Um, because I'll be doing those like four hour streams. I have to admit

3945
04:59:34,060 --> 04:59:37,020
It's probably gonna be a lot easier to like keep on top of everything

3946
04:59:37,820 --> 04:59:38,940
um

3947
04:59:38,940 --> 04:59:46,380
But like my plans have an expiration like you know, like aw strongy aren't you stretching yourself too thin doing the 1,000

3948
04:59:47,020 --> 04:59:48,060
uh

3949
04:59:48,060 --> 04:59:51,740
Celebration videos every 1000 one ace more video every 1000

3950
04:59:52,220 --> 04:59:58,220
Yeah, but it ends at a certain point and growth is an infinite like it'll slow down like it's definitely it'll slow down

3951
04:59:58,220 --> 05:00:04,460
There's no doubt about it. I like oh, but what about the um ace more clubs? You're doing what other v-tubers again?

3952
05:00:04,460 --> 05:00:07,580
It's gonna slow down. It's not infinite growth like it's it's

3953
05:00:08,540 --> 05:00:10,700
I have a goal of doing 100 v-tubers

3954
05:00:10,780 --> 05:00:17,340
I can do it all in one month if I really wanted to um or I can take my time and do it over the span of many months

3955
05:00:17,340 --> 05:00:20,220
Like everything everything slows down

3956
05:00:20,460 --> 05:00:22,460
It's just obviously debut happened

3957
05:00:23,020 --> 05:00:27,740
And then everything exploded and now everything's going to slowly come back like once the video game goes up

3958
05:00:27,820 --> 05:00:30,700
Like my next project is getting on a game show for the girls

3959
05:00:31,180 --> 05:00:36,620
And then the next project uh Azura's got her lovely donut song coming up next project like it's not

3960
05:00:37,660 --> 05:00:40,780
It's not like an absolute hammer in like as I said

3961
05:00:40,780 --> 05:00:47,020
We're getting clippers in place now because it was hard to get clippers in place before the girls were producing content because that's not possible

3962
05:00:47,900 --> 05:00:51,900
Um reeflings we aim for a million no no do not aim for a million

3963
05:00:52,140 --> 05:00:54,380
I'll be happy with a play button

3964
05:00:55,100 --> 05:00:59,340
As as myself as strony cuttles and then after that i'm like right we're done

3965
05:01:00,780 --> 05:01:05,660
I mean I'll still keep going but I'm not doing like any more celebratory type stuff

3966
05:01:08,380 --> 05:01:12,220
You spread scrawny scrawny propaganda on tiktok and instagram

3967
05:01:13,820 --> 05:01:15,180
Oh

3968
05:01:15,180 --> 05:01:17,260
Right, okay. It's time

3969
05:01:17,260 --> 05:01:19,260
I need to go for a pp

3970
05:01:20,060 --> 05:01:26,780
Um, I I'm at three million cooking xp. Can you see that you can cooking xp three million?

3971
05:01:28,620 --> 05:01:30,620
Yeah

3972
05:01:30,620 --> 05:01:32,300
That's fantastic

3973
05:01:32,300 --> 05:01:36,060
Okay, I am going to redirect into our lovely

3975
05:01:39,020 --> 05:01:40,300
um

3976
05:01:40,300 --> 05:01:42,780
She be cotton boom. She is playing a game called

3977
05:01:43,820 --> 05:01:46,700
Encrypted or something inscripted or something like that

3978
05:01:47,260 --> 05:01:48,060
Um

3979
05:01:48,060 --> 05:01:52,140
And it's a card game, but it's a bit creepy and thingy

3980
05:01:52,220 --> 05:01:57,180
So make sure you got your blanket on if you get a little scared reefling. Okay. I don't want you to get nervous

3981
05:01:57,260 --> 05:01:59,980
Okay, I'm going to go for the biggest

Please don't worry if you need to sleep during the time

3986
05:02:13,660 --> 05:02:18,380
Um, it's not my usual stream time unless I do a marathon then it is my usual stream time

3987
05:02:18,940 --> 05:02:23,580
Um, but I get the fantastic role of enjoyment

3988
05:02:23,660 --> 05:02:29,260
Sorry opportunity to play with none other than mercy modeste in t-minus four hours

3989
05:02:29,340 --> 05:02:31,820
It's somewhat hard to fight what's going on over there. Um

05:02:32,620 --> 05:02:38,540
But thank you so so much say hi to sheepsters for me and I will see you in four hours. Okay
