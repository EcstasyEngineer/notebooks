1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good morning sleepyhead!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning good evening good afternoon!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good morning sleepyhead!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning sleepyhead!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Good morning sleepyhead!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good morning good evening good afternoon!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you ready to play puzzle game with me?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can already see the first one.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, so in order to link to it,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to have to constantly close the game,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
well close it from stream, so actually close.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, but I will link you this website.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It should have a little insert, so you can name yourself if you like.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can do something humorous.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But we're just doing a test.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is testing 250 pieces an image.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll just take a moment...

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, that's not even names!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're just spamming!

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That was so quick!

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So we're just testing if you guys are able to

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
figure out the 250 pieces.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've got some cam music on in the background.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's just a chill day today.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've got a few funny images, but this is just the start,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so I just wanted to see how you guys do.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to put Azura together,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
because Azura's got teal in her hair.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can see AC's got blue over here,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
so I'm just going to drag her over here.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello! Good morning good evening good afternoon!

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm having to play Super Dipper safe.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My dad has fully come down with a cold.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not me in the middle with my little scored eyes!

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Um...

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mumme!

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Um...

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My...

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, my dad's unfortunately come down with a flu.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I actually had to go to the pharmacy yesterday for him.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And like I explained what's wrong,

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and they were like if he's not...

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If he still...

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He felt dizzy,

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but he took some strong sleeping medication

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that he got from the pharmacy,

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and they warned him like they don't use too much of it.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But I don't know, he like phoned me after stream,

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
like I was only in the other room,

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but he was too weak to like come out.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Um...

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And he was like I feel dizzy,

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so like I ran,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I got ready, went to the pharmacy,

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and the lady behind the counter was like

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
unfortunately we can't do anything for that kind of thing,

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
if it's not better in 24 hours,

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
like go with the doctor.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I'm currently quarantining myself from my dad,

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but the problem is we're sharing a space

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I really don't want to get sick.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Um...

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I had take away,

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and he's had subway.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Just to fill his tongue.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, there's the top of my peril.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My head, please.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can see that's my shell,

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but it's not fitting anywhere.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wait, that's my shell, is it not?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh no, that's my hair piece.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
These are my two shells.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Where did I go?

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I had my eyes here so I couldn't go.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, there's me.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, my shell goes here somewhere.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And then this is my other shell over here.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm gonna move these out of the room.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not sure that they are.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm stealing pieces from people's hands.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Right, this is a zero sleep,

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
because I can see that purple from anywhere.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But it's just a really chill day.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Um, nice and easy.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Um, I am...

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, you can't see,

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
because I'm a big hair, hold on.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Above, because I want to redact it,

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you're redacted, redacted.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you for censoring yourselves, Reeflings.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You guys are very smart when it comes to streaming.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You guys don't give yourself enough credit

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
for how smart or cool you are.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Um, I can see Mercy's head is being formed up here.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right, someone has gone for the old top method.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So if we can drag a zero up here and Mercy up here,

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we might be in somewhere.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Right, I can see that's a part of my shell.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Someone popped that up here.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh wait, I'll move a little bit.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm the dumbest Reefing love mummy.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wait, maybe I should go this side today.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't normally go this side.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Or did I just need to be a wee bit smaller today?

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, you can talk in game 2 if you want.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But yeah, I think he's going to get better soon.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He says he feels better, but he coughed up like phlegm

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
or something.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't remember what it's called.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Surprised we didn't have a mate,

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
a mate hunt or a mate ox, huh?

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know, you guys play so well in games together.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think someone said a way of the go,

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
they were like, normally like whenever a streamer

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
does something multiplayer that could be easily ruined,

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
like the autism gets a bit of a chat,

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but someone said something along the lines of

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
like, oh mummy's just so happy to play

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and see us that it never comes out.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I feel very loved when we can do goofy things like this together.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why is my eye out of alignment?

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh you guys forget, it's 250,

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it's 250 pieces too easy.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The next unlock is going to be my schedule for next week.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So you have to figure out what my schedule is.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let me get really clear.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, you can see the goods.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't wait for the 10k stream.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Strony's bathtub, yeah, yeah, yeah, but

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm done with the re-

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
message deleted by Strony's followers.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Family portrait, oh, oh dear.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Someone accidentally did it.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is emi's hair, oh sorry.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We have a few issues, we have a few technical errors,

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
don't worry we're getting there in the end.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's so efficient.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But yeah, the next one you're going to unlock,

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going to have to hide the screen,

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
because you're going to unlock my schedule for next week.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But should I make it 500 pieces?

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It keeps moving the puzzle your mum's just like.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay I'll do 500 for my schedule

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and then I will talk over what we're playing next week together.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are doing next week.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why is this music so emotional for no reason?

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just typed in copyright free Zelda.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Whoever's moving the puzzle please stop doing that.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're making it a bit harder to complete

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and we've got quite a few images to get through.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I have behind the scenes images

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that have never seen the light of day before.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So I'm very excited to show that.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I don't know what you guys are going to react to.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Use control to lock it in please gang.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What and then release?

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why you did it?

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay so this was just an easy one to get you started.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
These are the emotes of eyes.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You guys have put in the worst thing.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm in the way of it.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I just made it nice and easy.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't join because I'm on phone.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's just a casual stream snipe.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This isn't intense or anything.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We're literally sitting making puzzles.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right let's replay.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's the replay going to look like?

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay so this is me when I load it in.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not jumping away from us.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh that was so fast.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay I think you guys are going to need like 500 pieces.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because that was far too easy for you.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't want to sit on chat.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sorry I'm sitting on chat if I'm over here.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sorry.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Excuse me.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Just coming through.

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay you want a thousand pieces?

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh I'm not sure about that.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hold on.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I think I need to...

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh no.

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do I need to do a new room every time?

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think I need to give a new room every time.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Room settings.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh dear.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh dear oh dear.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think I need to create a new room darlings.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm so sorry.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Next one is my schedule.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And we can do a thousand pieces?

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Are you sure you want a thousand pieces?

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't think we can because of the background on it.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going to do 750 pieces.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay 700 pieces a schedule test.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think...

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh it's already just made the thing.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh this looks difficult.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not sure.

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
50 pieces might be too much for us reeflings.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I know.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Look I'm really testing.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Pet pie says 750 pieces puzzle.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Puzzle and it's my schedule.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Rollie legend.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you for becoming a member for over a month.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I was able to...

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Did that work?

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I swear if it does.

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He's not.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This one's not the easiest.

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll just make sure you guys are joining me.

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Or did I link the wrong thing?

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I think I linked the right thing.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah this one's 750 pieces.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll wait until you guys are in in.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Or is it not working?

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't see you guys able to join the list.

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If we all work together it'll be fine.

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm in?

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That doesn't display anyone.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It just says me the big fish.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We're in?

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Is mine broken?

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Is it moving?

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Is it moving for anyone?

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We're dragging pieces.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Refresh?

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Huh.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh are you in?

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're here.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yay!

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay good luck figuring out my thing.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I will give you a hint.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The ginger goes to the left of the schedule because that's what the photo is.

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Any skin colour goes to the left because again that's what the photo is.

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know why they didn't like that.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
God my joke wasn't seen.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry wait what was your joke?

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We're in let's go.

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh wait hold on let me get out of the way of the chat.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm always in the way I think I'm gonna have to...

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't believe it but I'm standing to the side.

253
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Are you guys okay if I cover up chat a little bit?

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We're in let's go.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
End the stream straight up.

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it...

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well let's just see.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My pintas.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
My saw.

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's actually really good.

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh I wish that was the tail.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know what the tail is.

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's go.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This puzzle is long like a reflexant.

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh why am I getting smaller?

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't be shy.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh my god how have you put together an eye already?

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's insane.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You guys are too good at this.

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like unironically you guys are too good.

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then you get to figure...

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh!

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Not you guys already figuring out plop plop plop.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is it in my schedule?

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All I see is plop plop plop yeah.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh hold on I've not got live chat on.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's horrible.

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Quality mate viewers are discussing a game idea

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
where multiple people collaboratively solve

280
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
a very large jigsaw puzzle.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That is the most accurate one I've seen so far.

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No?

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Look how efficient you guys are.

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Really color coding down here.

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What color coordination of the purple?

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The edge pieces?

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Someone's going to absolutely ham on the edge pieces.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Of course that's the first discernible thing

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that comes together.

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh!

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And more of the words are coming together.

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What do you think it says?

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It says get educated.

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Get educated.

295
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Plop plop plop.

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Refling's the master of edge truly.

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We live in a society.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I can see my belt coming together.

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Am I supposed to be doing this with you guys?

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Or am I allowed to like commentate

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
as if this is like a super MLG game?

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And the reflings are coming in clutch.

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We have the border of the south.

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We have a border north and left.

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, okay.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hold on a minute.

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We've got a whole quadrant.

308
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We have the shape over here.

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And of course I'm covering it up.

310
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll go in the middle.

311
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
As we can see to my right.

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, it's my right.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Your left, I guess.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Look at me.

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's in there.

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And we're getting...

317
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's all coming together.

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's like no good area to go.

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Isn't that amazing?

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I hate navigating.

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll just be all the way down here.

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay.

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you for all your hard work.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Refling.

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hi.

326
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hi, Johnny.

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hi, Refling.

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Good morning.

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We're playing a ridiculous game

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
where we put puzzles together.

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But the reward for doing the puzzle,

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
you'll never guess what it is.

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
As you get to see what my schedule is.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
For this week.

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, I see it.

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I see one.

337
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Epic Gamer, thank you for coming

338
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to member and to support.

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, no.

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
My freaking stream elements isn't up.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I can't see the history.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, and I'm just really big.

343
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's one of those streams where things

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
aren't working the way they ought to be.

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Thank you, Gamberly Legends.

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I made the month membership today.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Congratulations.

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you.

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And then Epic Gamer, thank you for coming to member.

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I appreciate it.

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
All membership streams resume on the last week.

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I will make up for any missed streams.

353
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I promise.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, it's all coming together.

355
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, sorry.

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Wait, how to...

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Check it out.

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can see it coming together.

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We've got weekly here.

360
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, someone had it.

361
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It was like that.

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't want to interfere too much.

363
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I feel like I'm going to sabotage it.

364
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, no.

365
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, no.

366
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Is this game what I think it is?

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is this game what I think it is?

368
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hold on a minute.

369
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, no.

370
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We've got the games together.

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, the games are coming together.

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, we've got get educated, get educated,

374
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
get educated, get educated.

375
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Plop, plop, plop.

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We've got a supermarket simulator.

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What remains of Edith Finch?

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That was a recommended game.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Kent Quispy.

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm blue, diva, diva, diva.

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Wait, why'd I forget the tune of that?

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm blue, abadi, abadi, and I'm blue.

384
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I would die if I would beat off a guy.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you for the membership extended.

386
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I have no idea.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I still want to say

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
about that.

389
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm like, yes, membership extended.

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, what do I see?

391
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Ring for adventure with a heart rate monitor.

392
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, I've got a collab with someone.

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Who have I got a collab with?

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, I'm sorry, Refling.

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, down here.

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, yeah, chase each other.

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Chase each other.

398
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yay, you did it.

399
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You did it.

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Thanks for subscribing again.

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And subscriptions all over you.

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If I were green, I would die.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If I were green, I would die.

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hey, Stony, we can see the finished puzzle

405
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
in the top left corner.

406
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, no.

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, don't cheat.

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's supposed to be a surprise.

409
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, no.

410
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, no, it's a cheat sheet at all.

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, no.

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's supposed to be a surprise.

413
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No.

414
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Wait, you guys hear the whole time?

415
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You just let me be happy in my ignorance?

416
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay, I'll be happy in my ignorance.

417
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Like it's me.

418
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I'm going with my little heart pose.

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I love that pose.

420
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I might unironically ready to commission that pose.

421
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Like with my hand forward and then the other one like...

422
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The only problem is this bit here,

424
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
it gets impossible.

425
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's why I was worried about doing a thousand pieces.

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because in it, it's just darkness.

427
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There's literally no logic to this section whatsoever.

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I mean, the best I can do is like just try and force it.

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, sorry.

430
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't know who that was, but sorry.

431
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wait, what, Mummy?

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You will play Sukiya?

433
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Maybe?

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So every beat you were hit,

435
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
like remember when Sukiya came out

436
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and everyone was going fucking...

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh, oh, ah, ah, ape shit over it?

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I was like, you know what?

439
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I want to see what the big deal is.

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And apparently it's just a short and sweet game.

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There's nothing too hard about it or nothing.

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Whoa, Sukiya?

443
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Isn't that Sukiya?

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Suka?

445
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Se'u?

446
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Eka?

447
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Um...

448
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Mods...

449
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Saw his...

450
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Jiggle his soul.

451
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Suika!

452
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Se'u...

453
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What did I say?

454
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Se'u-kiya.

455
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Sukiya.

456
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Danlos by the Ring Fit...

457
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The Ring Fit Adventure Squad record?

458
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You know it, boo-boo!

459
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know what the endurance thing is, but...

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Right, we do have a lot of...

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, this is where it gets difficult.

462
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Right, we have a date.

463
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We've got the 18th, so...

464
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Uh, what's the day's date?

465
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
15...

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So it'd be 16, 17, 18.

467
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Um...

468
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So...

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Uh, oh no, it says Wednesday.

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay, so we need to find Monday.

471
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's Tuesday.

472
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Alright, we've got Monday here.

473
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Um, so we can start with Monday and Tuesday,

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and then we can start putting the games in the order...

475
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that they...

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
start in.

477
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I've got a date with Momaya, later, Virgin.

478
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Are you holding on to a date?

479
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, you know.

480
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No, there it is.

481
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Look, it's on the move.

482
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So Monday needs to go, like...

483
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
somewhere here.

484
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't know where, but somewhere here.

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Sorry, Strontium.

486
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
My pre-order can't handle the puzzle website,

487
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
so I can't play along without your stream lag and heavy.

488
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll have to spectate.

489
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm so sorry.

490
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Aw, don't worry.

491
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry that, um...

492
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I thought this would be a relatively easy one

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
to, like, stream snipe on.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But I know not all PCs are built equally.

495
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's okay.

496
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Now this one, the time and then the dates

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
is gonna be a really hard section

498
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
because I always stream at the same time.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm not sure how easy it's gonna be.

500
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm just trying to see if there's anything obvious.

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Now there is a bit of pink text.

502
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Ooh, sorry.

503
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There is a bit of pink text.

504
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Where do I need some sort of purple hue on this side?

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Is there anything with a purple hue?

506
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, here!

507
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is the very piece I've been needing.

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Ta-da!

509
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm just so smart.

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
See, I helped!

511
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I did one!

512
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Turn off GPU rendering.

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Stony please.

514
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Suki again.

515
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Call it Suika.

516
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Suika.

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh!

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Aw.

519
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You found it out now.

520
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Drawing gen 2 suggestions.

521
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I kept my word.

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh no!

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Did I just take my meds?

524
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Hello?

525
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Hello, reflings?

526
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Did I just take my meds?

527
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh no!

528
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Hold on.

529
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Did I need a refresh?

530
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Refresh?

531
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There's no refresh.

532
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh no, we're back.

533
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We're back.

534
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I was like,

535
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
still there.

536
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay, we weren't real.

537
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No, don't say that.

538
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I think it's sad enough in Elden Ring when we finished our boss

539
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and then you guys despawned instantly.

540
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
A repopulation.

541
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Whoa, did I just take my meds?

542
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't take my meds for you.

543
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Right, we've got Monday.

544
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So Monday has to go.

545
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

546
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay, I guess not.

547
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, there's a Wednesday.

548
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Well, we can bring Wednesday under Tuesday.

549
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, sorry.

550
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
No?

551
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm trying to help,

552
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
but I think I'm making a worse refling.

553
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Right, where's Tuesday?

554
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Tuesday's here.

555
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm gonna bring...

556
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I think the lag isn't helping.

557
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh no, wait, what?

558
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Where's Wednesday?

559
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Where's Wednesday not just here?

560
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm gonna go crazy.

561
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, there's Wednesday.

562
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
No?

563
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No, there's more wait now.

564
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There's Friday if I'm Friday.

565
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm helping, I'm helping.

566
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Right, where's the rest of Friday though?

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
He took my piece and left.

568
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No, I'm here, I'm here.

569
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Where's my thigh?

570
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Look for a really...

571
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, there's Friday.

572
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I found Friday.

573
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh, so wait, someone's doing something down here with it.

574
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Where's my thigh?

575
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
There's like a big chunk of my thigh missing.

576
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm gonna go look for it.

577
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Hold on.

578
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Look for a really pale piece.

579
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I don't see it.

580
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh no.

581
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I lost it.

582
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Someone's holding on to my thigh piece.

583
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm eating the thigh.

584
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm sucking on it right now.

585
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Right.

586
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hold on, what's going on here?

587
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, this is a bottom section of one of these.

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I can see it.

589
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Where is that thigh?

590
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I genuinely can't find that thigh piece.

591
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It would be so bright compared to all the others.

592
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Eclan.

593
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
What?

594
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Hold it.

595
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Who's holding that in red?

596
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You know I can kick whoever is trolling.

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
If you just trolling, I am going to kick you.

598
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm not.

599
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm not here for the troll.

600
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I just want to have fun and play puzzle.

601
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They chopped too hard.

602
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's not missing.

603
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What, you guys saw it?

604
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I can't see it.

605
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay.

606
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
One second.

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't know what it's going to come up with when I block someone.

608
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Sorry, but please don't troll, darling.

609
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
We're just here to have fun.

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I am blocked.

611
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I will kick from games.

612
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Please don't troll.

613
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm just trying to have fun, goobers.

614
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, someone found the thigh piece.

615
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Wow, look at my juicy thighs.

616
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And look at this.

617
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I've got like a little armpit here.

618
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I've got my eyes and my little shells.

619
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And my little spikes here.

620
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I love my little spikes.

621
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I love my spikes that come like here because it's very, very cuttlefish-esque.

622
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And then my little spikes here, which is also cuttlefish-esque.

623
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Is it that?

624
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Hmm.

625
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Sorry, I think I keep accidentally moving it.

626
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm not sure.

627
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I see the shells.

628
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I see all the-

629
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's going to be so hard to do these ones.

630
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They're like impossible to decipher from one another.

631
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm so sorry.

632
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I just heard my dad blow his nose.

633
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Sorry, I just heard my dad blow his nose.

634
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He's not very well.

635
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Mummy's left ball?

636
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What are your names?

637
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Stronny's armpit?

638
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You guys are ridiculous.

639
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Stronny's building?

640
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Building what?

641
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What am I making?

642
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Building what?

643
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's my question.

644
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hi, everyone.

645
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Hi, replay.

646
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Good morning.

647
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, well, you guys are doing it.

648
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You put together my schedule.

649
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, these color pieces are going to be a bit more difficult.

650
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh, I did it.

651
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I helped a little bit.

652
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, hold on.

653
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm just going to try it in all this space.

654
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, I just connected two pieces together.

655
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, I think I saw where it matched.

656
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes.

657
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We're doing it.

658
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Reflings, we're doing it.

659
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If we just force it, then it works.

660
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It just works.

661
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I know you shouldn't really force things in a tight small hole,

662
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but yeah, I think it works.

663
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Reflings strong together.

664
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm excited to get slapped this week.

665
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Best part of the art is the drawing being out, yeah.

666
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Let's see what I was doing.

667
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Maybe one up here.

668
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, I ain't got that.

669
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't have the reaction time to see who's doing that to ban them.

670
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I feel like you guys are all getting frustrated with one another.

671
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Mod's a precious man still.

672
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Right, we do have like one...

673
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh, no, I lost it.

674
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh, I found it.

675
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I was worried about that.

676
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh, sorry.

677
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm touching the same piece as someone else's.

678
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Sorry, refling, I just...

679
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Me and this refling just held hands.

680
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Later.

681
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Later.

682
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Here?

683
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
No, not there.

684
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Maybe that one?

685
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm starting to feel that we might be getting frustrated at one another

686
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and shaking the puzzle a little bit.

687
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm just getting that slight indication.

688
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm not sure if my theory is founded at all.

689
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But I think, perhaps...

690
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I've locked this thing seven times.

691
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I can't focus.

692
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh, my connection!

693
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
No!

694
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
My connection's gone again!

695
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I think if you move around too much, it's killing the thingy.

696
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Hydration checked.

697
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We are so cool.

698
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I mean, you can tell what I'm doing, right?

699
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I think we know what we're doing.

700
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What should I...

701
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Maybe, wait, next time I'll make it, I'll see if I can like lock it or something.

702
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I don't know.

703
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, no, my connection.

704
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's trying its best, refling.

705
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh!

706
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, it's back.

707
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Ta-da!

708
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, look out.

709
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm helping, I'm helping.

710
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Did you do it?

711
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, sorry.

712
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, guys.

713
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yay!

714
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's my schedule for the week!

715
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's right, I put you to work for it.

716
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
When other VTubers hand it to you so willingly,

717
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I raised your IQ levels by doing the puzzle.

718
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yatta!

719
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay, so for next week's schedule,

720
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm drawing your nasty Gen 2 suggestions.

721
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I already know I'm going to get a slim girl.

722
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm going to have to sit and actually develop her.

723
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And we get to name them as well.

724
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I asked Mercy.

725
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm going to give her a sister.

726
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I had five hours sleep,

727
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
but speaking of less sleep,

728
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
is her still awake, I think?

729
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Hm.

730
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Monk is.

731
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Or maybe she's asleep, I don't know.

732
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
She might be asleep and it was an old message I read, but...

733
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes, we are going to draw Gen 2 together.

734
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I have to do your suggestions.

735
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Mercy was very kind.

736
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I asked her,

737
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh no, we got kicked!

738
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay, we got kicked, that's fine.

739
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Scores!

740
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh my God, let's see who does the most.

741
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Hostrooms can't be kicked now.

742
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Force anonymous restrictions, game mode.

743
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
How autistic are you?

744
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Pieces will be neatly arranged,

745
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
appeasing the autists?

746
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We got kicked, that's rude.

747
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I think I did self destruct,

748
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
that's why I just in case.

749
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh wait,

750
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
now I need to actually put up my schedule on screen

751
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
to talk about, hold on.

752
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Wait, I need to put my schedule up one second,

753
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm sorry.

754
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
One moment,

755
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
okay, I need to talk about my schedule.

756
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Boom!

757
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh, well, yeah.

758
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's a bit bigger than I was anticipating.

759
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay, there we go.

760
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
This is my schedule for next week.

761
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So yes,

762
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
tomorrow,

763
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Mercy gave me the basis of what she used

764
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
on her alternative design and stuff.

765
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And then the day after,

766
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I am making a PowerPoint presentation

767
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
on my special interests,

768
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and you're getting educated along the way.

769
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay?

770
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yes,

771
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm going to teach you things

772
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and stuff that I like,

773
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
so you're being forced to get educated.

774
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And then we're going to try Supermarket Simulator.

775
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It seems like a small two hour game.

776
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm going to watch Azura play it

777
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
because I don't know what the game is about.

778
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I've never played it,

779
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
but I've seen a lot of Etubers play it.

780
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If it's not short,

781
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
it might get substituted for this like road

782
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
game where you have to try and get the car

783
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
to go as long as possible.

784
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But,

785
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
you're like,

786
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Strongly Restrictions Disabled Image Preview,

787
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
so it's a surprise.

788
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes, sir.

789
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Okay.

790
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It might be the long drive.

791
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah, I don't know if Supermarket Simulator

792
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
can kind of infinitely go on,

793
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and I need to wrap it up.

794
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I've got Ring Fit Adventure

795
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
with my heart rate monitor.

796
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
My heart rate monitor is here.

797
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So I wanted to give it a shot.

798
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
See how I do in my fitness levels.

799
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Probably shite, let's be honest.

800
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And then we're playing

801
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
If that's how you guys want me to pronounce it.

802
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, Supermarket Sim can be easy endurance.

803
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
A lot of clapping in that stream.

804
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I mean, if you want it to be, yes.

805
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Oh, it's an infinite game, Supermarket Simulator.

806
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You won't overdo it on this time on Ring Fit.

807
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No, it's like two hours and done,

808
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
maybe even an hour and done.

809
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Like, I don't want to be too loud for my dad.

810
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
He really does not feel well right now.

811
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
After stream, I'm going to check on him,

812
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and I think I'm making him food.

813
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know if I'm about to do the old chicken soup.

814
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Chicken noodle soup for him, I don't know.

815
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But we're playing Ring Fit for two hours,

816
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and then the next thing we're playing,

817
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm not going to say it right, ever.

818
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It says,

819
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
for two hours,

820
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and then I'm going to go offline for a little bit,

821
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and then at Azura's usual stream time,

822
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
me and Azura are going to play We Were Here.

823
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's like a free puzzle game,

824
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
so I'll be curious to see if we can get through it or not.

825
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I have played it once before,

826
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
but I don't really remember too much of the details.

827
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Wow, thank you for becoming a member.

828
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Like, Lux, you get me educated, get me educated,

829
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
get me educated, blah blah blah.

830
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

831
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
The goats.

832
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Suica.

833
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Suica.

834
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Then the stream snipe game is Mario Kart 8.

835
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Now, before you're like,

836
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
oh, I can't wait to ruin you in the video game.

837
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I promise you, I have absolutely nothing to offer in the video game.

838
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You will win.

839
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I will be pleading with you to wait at the finish line.

840
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Fiendish, thank you for the extended membership.

841
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Mummy up...

842
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Mummy Square 2? Up 2?

843
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Mummy Up 2.

844
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What does that mean, Mummy Up 2? What are you up to?

845
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But Mario Kart is a stream game,

846
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and I picked it on a weekend.

847
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I was very dumb and didn't pick a weekend

848
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
for the Jelly Bean game,

849
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
but we do it on weekends.

850
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Mario Kart's subspace game, then no!

851
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Stop the press!

852
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, God, we got a score.

853
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The Sunday Driver, honestly.

854
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
My dad's asking me.

855
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He's like, are you going to learn to drive?

856
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm like, no, I like my bike.

857
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And then a game that was recommended to me by you,

858
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The Reeflings, is What Remains of Edith Finch.

859
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Apparently, it's like,

860
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
super-sure two-hour game type thing.

861
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So everything is planned for two hours this week,

862
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
except for the We Were Here collab,

863
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
because that's like a go-off,

864
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and then a comeback on again.

865
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Didn't Amy play that?

866
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I couldn't tell you if she played Edith Finch.

867
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm not sure.

868
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Okay, let me get rid of the schedule.

869
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then let me do the next puzzle.

870
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What do I make you do?

871
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Would you rather Strony and Mercy, AC or Amy,

872
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
or, wait, sorry, Strony and Mercy,

873
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or AC and me, or Azur and Sheeby.

874
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
What would you prefer for this forbidden artwork

875
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that has never seen the late a day?

876
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Strony and Mercy, okay.

877
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I can't believe it.

878
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Okay, Strony and Mercy.

879
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'll do 450 pieces, I think.

880
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I think this is what I was supposed to do.

881
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Now, I have hidden the artwork.

882
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So before you're like,

883
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
oh, I don't know what it is.

884
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You ain't supposed to.

885
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You're not supposed to know what the artwork is.

886
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So it's an actual challenge.

887
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And I thought you were going to be a challenge.

888
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Good luck.

889
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So there isn't a background,

890
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
so I had to add a green and purple hue into the background

891
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
to make it even more challenging for you.

892
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Now, I don't think any of these artworks were posted.

893
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
As far as I'm aware, they've not been posted.

894
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
For one reason or another,

895
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
we'll not go around to it.

896
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's not really been a moment to annoy each other with it.

897
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I must go stay strong for the plot-plot-plot roofling.

898
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, thank you for hanging.

899
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Please don't worry.

900
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Is there an option for two pieces only?

901
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
A wee bit of a cheat sheet at all.

902
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Take the edge pieces to the respective edges.

903
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, we've got the tactics coming in.

904
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
There is no way.

905
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You already have a corner of green.

906
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's insane.

907
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I think they've already figured out that I'm on the left side.

908
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't know. I'm getting the indication the rooflings have figured out

909
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm on the left side. I repeat.

910
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm a professional edging. Don't worry.

911
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh yeah, it's edging time.

912
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Well, you post the artwork there.

913
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Of course, I'll maybe get Mercy to post it

914
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
so she can get the Twitter interactions for it.

915
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Because I'm not fussed for Twitter.

916
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Honestly, on Twitter, I'm like,

917
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm making prego ASMR. Here's the picture.

918
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And then like, oh my god, thank you for 10,000 subscribers.

919
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We got in a debut highlight

920
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
from a previously established clip channel.

921
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And oh my god, everyone's blown ahead in subscribers.

922
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I actually do have good news about anyone who does clipping

923
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and has an established channel.

924
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We, on August 1st, the Allure

925
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
are going to...

926
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the Allure.

927
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Alluring.

928
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Are going to release a clipping program

929
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
where you get paid for posting clips

930
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
if it, you know, like $1 per 1000 views type thing.

931
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh my god, why is it so tiny?

932
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Hold on.

933
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Is that the bottom of it already?

934
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Well, you can kind of see Mercy and me coming together, huh?

935
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It was such a well put together cut.

936
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Did you see it?

937
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It literally propelled us ahead so much.

938
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I'm so thankful.

939
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So I'm very ha...

940
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh my god, the puzzle's tiny compared to how many pieces are on the damn thing.

941
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Hmm.

942
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Maybe I've made this too easy?

943
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I mean, you can see me here.

944
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Excuse me, you're doing what together?

945
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I don't know, you're going to have to do the puzzle.

946
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You're going to have to do the puzzle to figure out what we're doing.

947
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But yes, thank you for $10,000.

948
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm very excited to see how the ASMR stream's going to go.

949
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I feel like I'm going to, like, rub the bathtub

950
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and everyone's going to be like,

951
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
oh, my ears!

952
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And I'll be like, yep, that's kind of what happens when you're in a bathtub.

953
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Could you imagine it's an alternative puzzle?

954
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
As much as I would adore to do that?

955
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
No.

956
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, look at me!

957
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Hi, me.

958
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh, you can see one of my side details and stuff.

959
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh, there's my abdomen.

960
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I can see Mercy's belt here.

961
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
This is like Mercy's belt.

962
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh, my God, Mercy has a belt, yes.

963
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I know you're normally looking at her bowl area.

964
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, look, see, this is Mercy's collar here.

965
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
They do such a casual thing.

966
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
They are holding hands!

967
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I showed that video with the clips on my friends

968
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and he subscribed all together.

969
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Literally, when we finished the AC collab,

970
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
she hit 6,000 subscribers.

971
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And I think, like, she's blown past that.

972
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I mean, I celebrated 10k.

973
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It says I'm at 10.7.

974
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm like, oh, my God, the ASMR debt increases.

975
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm like, hmm.

976
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I think the scoring might be skewed

977
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
because the points are going to the slotted thingy.

978
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Oh, yeah.

979
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Okay, see, Mercy's...

980
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Oh, I apologize for y'all, I'm high.

981
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I got five hours of sleep today,

982
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
but I'm going back to...

983
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm going back to bed.

984
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Oh, no, I've got the Yumi watch along.

985
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yumi plus have a concert today.

986
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I could maybe get a nap before it.

987
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I mean, what happens if I had a nap on you, Refland?

988
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You're just so hot and warm to lie on.

989
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And then you pet my hair and I fall asleep

990
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and then you can violently wake me up

991
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
for the Yumi plus concert watch along.

992
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I think that would do quite...

993
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh, what are me and...

994
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Oh, what's going on?

995
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Me and Mercy, what's going on here?

996
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Hmm.

997
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There's a finger being pointed at Mercy.

998
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Wait a minute, there's a finger being pointed at me.

999
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What is this artwork all about?

1000
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
A concert of what?

1001
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is it heavy metal?

1002
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't think they've done heavy metal.

1003
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I don't know what they've done.

1004
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But...

1005
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That's a cosy tube.

1006
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Is cosy tube fucking stream sniping right now?

1007
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Is someone ERPing is cosy tube?

1008
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Be honest right now.

1009
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
What?

1010
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Key signal.

1011
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Thank you for the 50 gifted memberships.

1012
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What the heck?

1013
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Are you serious?

1014
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We're playing a puzzle game.

1015
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Thank you for the 50 bomb.

1016
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Holy moly!

1017
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What?

1018
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Thank you.

1019
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

1020
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Thank you for the 50 bomb.

1021
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Big massive balls doesn't say anything.

1022
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Key signal, absolute Chad.

1023
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Thank you.

1024
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Congrats to those who got it.

1025
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Have you seen the Shibi stream?

1026
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I saw the start where they read the first script

1027
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
to say that the script master got an absolute bollocking

1028
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
as an understatement.

1029
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah, he got an absolute bollocking.

1030
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Don't get me wrong, it was funny and it made good, hilarious clips.

1031
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But I paid, you know, substantial money.

1032
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I don't, yeah, so don't worry, don't worry.

1033
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Glorps your giggles.

1034
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
No, don't start it off again.

1035
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't even want to know.

1036
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I listened to Emi and Shibi do it, like,

1037
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and then it's the thing.

1038
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, Stronys chair.

1039
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That was so good.

1040
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Mummy's left ball.

1041
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't.

1042
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Stronys gaggle stick.

1043
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Are you serious?

1044
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I just read that.

1045
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
No.

1046
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh my God.

1047
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Congrats on everyone who's catching the membership, by the way.

1048
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You have emotes.

1049
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The more emotes are coming.

1050
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I repeat, more emotes are coming.

1051
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Shibi, I had to go on her account and Shibi has, like,

1052
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
20 missing emotes slots right now.

1053
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
She's got so many emotes she can commission.

1054
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Hi.

1055
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Hi.

1056
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Thank you for joining.

1057
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
We're playing a puzzle game.

1058
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you click the link below, not only do I get your IP address

1059
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
so I can come to your house late at night

1060
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
when I need to take my frustrations out on you

1061
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
after losing Valtro,

1062
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
but you guys have done it.

1063
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What do your elf eyes see, little reeflings?

1064
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Real.

1065
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
No.

1066
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Okay, you may just get access to the puzzle game.

1067
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Oh, sorry.

1068
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Wait a minute.

1069
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Why are me and Mercy fighting?

1070
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Do you want to know why we're fighting?

1071
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Because I want to kill you because I'm a siren

1072
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and she wants to kill you because she's a yandere

1073
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and we're both fighting over who gets to kill you.

1074
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That's why I commissioned this artwork.

1075
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Because we're fighting over who gets to kill you.

1076
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm not even kidding.

1077
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's the context of why I commissioned this.

1078
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm like, no, I want to drown him.

1079
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And she's like, no, I'm a yandere.

1080
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I have the right to perish him.

1081
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh, my God.

1082
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So that is that one.

1083
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Did you like it?

1084
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's us together.

1085
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
This was very early access.

1086
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Before we had nail polish and bandaid designs and such.

1087
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But yeah, no, no, no, it's true.

1088
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's true.

1089
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Very kawaii ne.

1090
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Reconnecting.

1091
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Okay.

1092
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Next one.

1093
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You're not allowed.

1094
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
No peeking.

1095
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
No peeking.

1096
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Right.

1097
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You can have AC and Emmy or you can have Azura and Chibi.

1098
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
What's your choice, darlings?

1099
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Do not giggle sticker puzzle thing.

1100
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Honestly.

1101
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Kawaii Disney or something.

1102
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yes, exactly.

1103
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Kawaii Disney.

1104
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Thank you again for the 50 gifted memberships.

1105
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
That was an incredibly kind key signal.

1106
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You absolute Chad comes in, gives memberships, doesn't say a thing, walks away.

1107
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You want to do who...

1108
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Oh, you guys are actually split.

1109
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh, but I've got Azura.

1110
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1111
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
No.

1112
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You guys are going to like this one.

1113
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'll do 450 because I don't want to...

1114
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I don't want to take up all your room, you know,

1115
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
blaze it and all that jazz.

1116
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

1117
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Because we've actually...

1118
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's already been an hour and we've done two puzzles.

1119
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Wait.

1120
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Have we only done two puzzles?

1121
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Are you squidding me right now?

1122
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Bubba the Great, thank you for the extended membership.

1123
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
We survived the first month.

1124
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Let's go.

1125
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yay.

1126
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Thank you.

1127
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Okay, new puzzle, puzzle time.

1128
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Boom.

1129
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1130
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I want to double boom.

1131
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And you come.

1132
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And you come.

1133
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So this is a sheebie and Azura artwork together.

1134
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
The preview has been disabled.

1135
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So please have fun with what happens next.

1136
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh my God, look at you go...

1137
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh my God.

1138
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Actually, can I say something really weird?

1139
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I really like watching ant videos.

1140
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You know those people that have ant videos

1141
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and show the colonies going to work

1142
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and how well in that they do?

1143
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I think it's really fascinating.

1144
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And I really enjoy it.

1145
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And I'm kind of getting those vibes.

1146
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh my God, you guys are doing really well.

1147
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I wanted for my doughnathon to maybe have an ant habitarium.

1148
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
But I don't think I can do it.

1149
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Let's start edging, bros.

1150
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Ant eater girl for Gen 2.

1151
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, tomorrow is when I do all my goofy Gen 2 streams, okay?

1152
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
If you guys want to continue to do puzzles

1153
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
after my planned ones are done,

1154
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I can do the thumbnails if you want.

1155
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They're not the most exciting thumbnails.

1156
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Can't win them all.

1157
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Also, hey, I just got here.

1158
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Hi, hi.

1159
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Don't worry, don't worry.

1160
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
We're just ants.

1161
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
No, reflings, that's not what I meant.

1162
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I mean, just look how efficient you are.

1163
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
This is actually really pleasing to my brain to watch.

1164
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Literally, they're so well coordinated.

1165
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's proof that you share a brain.

1166
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Oh, we've got Azura in Shibi's face.

1167
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I was going to say, I'm going to give you a hint.

1168
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Azura is on the, I've colored, the background is colored

1169
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
to what their color is.

1170
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So yeah, Shibi's on the red and Azura's on the purple.

1171
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Purples.

1172
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I like the taffy sounds a lot.

1173
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I have to go for now, but I'll try and come back later for now.

1174
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Bye bye.

1175
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Thank you for hanging.

1176
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Please don't worry.

1177
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I can't believe she hates us and wants to be a parent.

1178
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Oh, it's my lore.

1179
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You forgot my lore.

1180
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I want to end all of humanity via hypnosis.

1181
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
No, that's me who has yet to freaking upload a serious hypnosis video, bruh.

1182
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I need to do it.

1183
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'm not beating the accusations of how rubbish a hypnosis is,

1184
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
but I said, like, when my dad goes home,

1185
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I am going to be glued to that recording booth.

1186
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm not even kidding.

1187
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I have so much to catch up on.

1188
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I have so many...

1189
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Sorry, I'm just putting this back to the start.

1190
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I have so many ASMR collabs to finalize

1191
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
because I do not want to accept any more.

1192
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Oh, it's coming together.

1193
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
But what is Azura and Shibi doing?

1194
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
What are they doing in this picture?

1195
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I just remembered the hypnosis in the bagpipe short, honestly.

1196
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
We're going to be under a spell.

1197
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's inevitable.

1198
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
They're hugging something.

1199
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
What are they hugging?

1200
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
What are they hugging?

1201
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
They're going to figure it out.

1202
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Who knows?

1203
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The reeflings are working hard and diligently.

1204
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Well, I just realized how awkward it is to do Shibi's hair in a puzzle

1205
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
because it's just like the wippy lanes.

1206
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The look they're giving me making my jiggle song.

1207
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Shibi, you're done.

1208
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm not reading any more of that.

1209
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Whoopsies.

1210
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I mean, you guys are getting there.

1211
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I think you're going to be able to figure out what happens next.

1212
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You're getting close.

1213
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Now, to give you a help in the background,

1214
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
the Veiler logo is in the background.

1215
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Just to give you a helping hand.

1216
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So there's a text in the background that says Veiler,

1217
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
just to make it a bit easier.

1218
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It is, yes, copyright free Zelda music.

1219
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
How dare you identify my peaceful.

1220
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
My peaceful.

1221
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, it's stalled.

1222
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I don't know why.

1223
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh, there we go.

1224
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That was strange.

1225
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I don't know why that broke.

1226
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay, it's back.

1227
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'm sorry.

1228
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm sorry.

1229
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Your peaceful music is back.

1230
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I apologize.

1231
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
She thinks she still needs to spell it and chance me.

1232
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Oh.

1233
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Is it supposed to be us?

1234
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know.

1235
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I don't have to come on in and help the puzzle.

1236
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I see a lot of blue for his hair.

1237
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yes.

1238
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
When feet.

1239
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I didn't have a feet picture in mind.

1240
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I was going to show a heavily censored artwork I got on myself,

1241
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
but it was pretty outrageous.

1242
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I have to admit.

1243
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
There's three brief ones were jumping me.

1244
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Let's just say that's what the artwork was.

1245
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
They were jumping me.

1246
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Both their hair is a puzzle on their own.

1247
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Honestly.

1248
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So when are you going to release puzzles?

1249
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Oh, you went like an actual physical puzzle.

1250
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Honestly, a micro puzzle would be adorable.

1251
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I don't care what anyone says.

1252
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I think a micro puzzle would be adorable.

1253
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Jumping you affectionately.

1254
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Yes.

1255
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Very affectionately.

1256
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Very, very, very engaging, if you will.

1257
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
A word by that marriage.

1258
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I think it would be cute.

1259
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe I can order custom puzzles and be like, hey, I have like 100.

1260
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I mean, you guys are getting there.

1261
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You're getting very close.

1262
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Now, a remainder that Azura has weight on her ears.

1263
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
She has gooped ears.

1264
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So maybe that's a bit of a hinge.

1265
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,000
As always, Madame has her lovely suit.

1266
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Throughout Heaven and Earth, we are the jumping ones.

1267
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
The reeflings are me, myself and I.

1268
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I cannot wait to write that pregnancy script.

1269
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It's going to be the most wild thing.

1270
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And before I get so passionate about it,

1271
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
it's like a one hour long like sleep aid audio,

1272
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
but like I talk for the first 30 minutes.

1273
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And then like we have a nap together whilst you're in my tummy.

1274
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I can just see me getting so passionate when I write about it.

1275
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm not even kidding.

1276
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm so happy I get to fucking make pregnant with you ASMR.

1277
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Like, ah, this is exactly what I want to do.

1278
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I don't want to be serious.

1279
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't want to be trihard.

1280
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Double heartbeat ASMR.

1281
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Boom, boom.

1282
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
A bit too affectionate maybe.

1283
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Hydration check reeflings.

1284
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'm having to drink water.

1285
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
No tea.

1286
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm having no tea today because I need to...

1287
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh!

1288
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Oh, reeflings.

1289
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
What do you see?

1290
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
We're getting edged with the last piece.

1291
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Any Azura and Shibi fans?

1292
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Is that you?

1293
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Be honest, reeflings.

1294
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Is that you in the middle and enjoying the embrace?

1295
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
The big embraces?

1296
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yeah?

1297
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah, you enjoying the embrace?

1298
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm glad.

1299
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That's me.

1300
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Hmm.

1301
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Where's Azura's hand reaching to?

1302
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You don't worry about that part.

1303
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay, that part comes later.

1304
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm being hugged by the wrong woman.

1305
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
The outline makes me think it's throwing me.

1306
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Hmm.

1307
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Four big personalities collide.

1308
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Being spoiled by Madam and Mama is the best.

1309
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah.

1310
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Okay, now last but certainly not least.

1311
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Once this expired is a Emmy and AC together.

1312
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Being so adorable.

1313
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Let me just hide my screen so you guys don't get any spoilers to what's ahead.

1314
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But here is AC and Emmons.

1315
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Again, we'll just do 450 please.

1316
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Because it's a good...

1317
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Or I think it's a good number.

1318
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It's not too difficult.

1319
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It didn't take too long.

1320
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And the room can be found.

1321
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Pe-A-Z-Z-L-A.

1322
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Ta-da!

1323
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Now this is a Emmy and AC.

1324
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So orange and blue.

1325
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Yeah.

1326
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Let's get...

1327
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
On your marks.

1328
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Get set.

1329
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Spoiler, there's a screen.

1330
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I must unfortunately decline the offer of that embrace.

1331
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You can be hugged by any member of your luring.

1332
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Cheeky young.

1333
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Okay, I think I might be really cheeky and after the stream go for a nap before the Yumi Plus stream.

1334
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Is that bad of me?

1335
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Is that naughty?

1336
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I think it is naughty.

1337
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm a sleepy baby.

1338
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I got five hours.

1339
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Orange and blue.

1340
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Florida colours.

1341
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
No, movie poster colours.

1342
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Remember that post that broke down that all movie posters are blue and orange hue?

1343
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It's only not if you don't wake up in time.

1344
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We gotta quickly fin...

1345
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
We gotta finish quickly to get her rims.

1346
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh no, don't worry about it like that.

1347
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's not like that.

1348
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oh, I see Emmy.

1349
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Emmy's being made.

1350
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But where's AC's face?

1351
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I don't see AC.

1352
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Oh, there she is.

1353
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
She's starting to form over here.

1354
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You guys are doing it.

1355
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Okay, we've got a border on AC's side.

1356
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's coming over.

1357
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'm just gonna plop it down there, but Emmy is thoroughly...

1358
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Well, I can see AC's cold in here.

1359
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Is that AC's belt, maybe?

1360
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, I see Emmy's belt.

1361
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
See, Emmy has a belt like this.

1362
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
This is the wee piece here.

1363
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh god, I misunderstood me.

1364
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Said Emmy's being made.

1365
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
No, I have to...

1366
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That's an ASMR booth.

1367
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
No, in theory, the girls were conceptualised...

1368
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
with us all together.

1369
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
No, you'll be full of energy.

1370
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So you can cheer as loud and proud for Yume Plus, honestly.

1371
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I'm so excited to see there.

1372
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Me asking them for notes like, hey, how did you do this?

1373
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
By the way, not asking for no particular reason.

1374
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Like, hey, what did it cost?

1375
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
How did you do it?

1376
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I just need to know so I can do it for my girls.

1377
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That'd be great if you can give me some insider knowledge.

1378
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'd appreciate it.

1379
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Okay, what's going on?

1380
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Emmy, Emmy's coming together.

1381
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I see Emmy's tummy.

1382
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And she's got her hands together.

1383
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I know what's happening here, but I can see...

1384
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh, look at the smugness on AC.

1385
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What's going on here?

1386
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Veiler concert win?

1387
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I don't know, it depends.

1388
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But look at the...

1389
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Emmy's brought to tears.

1390
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Why would my daughter...

1391
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Why would my darling daughter be brought to tears?

1392
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
What is going on in this image?

1393
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
What is going on in this image?

1394
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Emmy with brown hair?

1395
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
No, she's ginger, I promise you.

1396
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
She's ginger.

1397
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I was so confused why she thought she was blonde.

1398
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm like, in what universe, my damn?

1399
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You are not blonde, my dearest.

1400
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
AC stealing her big bro?

1401
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
No.

1402
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
But you're putting the image together.

1403
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I think you'll be able to tell shortly.

1404
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I think you'll be able to tell shortly.

1405
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
What do you mean again, AC's big bro?

1406
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Emmy fake cries all the time, I'm not filled.

1407
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
She's probably on his pack.

1408
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
She still insists she's dirty blonde.

1409
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
She's ginger.

1410
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
If she wants to say she's dirty blonde, I'm not arguing.

1411
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

1412
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But the concept is that she's a ginger.

1413
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
She's in denial, that's what she is.

1414
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Someone just guessed it.

1415
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
AC being taller.

1416
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So if you didn't know,

1417
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Emmy is 140 centimetres.

1418
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
But AC is 142 centimetres.

1419
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So what is this artwork portraying?

1420
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Hi, Elf.

1421
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Elf Jeff, what kind of profile picture is that?

1422
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Is that Doctor House is like a telly tubby?

1423
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
What is your profile picture?

1424
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Elf Jeff, thank you for becoming a member.

1425
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But oh my god, is that Doctor House

1426
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
is a telly tubby?

1427
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Yeah, oh my god, that was off.

1428
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Emmy Burley, no.

1429
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Emmy's not the Burley in this one.

1430
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
This is very...

1431
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Thank you for becoming a member, I do appreciate that though.

1432
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Thank you for the support.

1433
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Hugh, Larry as Tinky Winky.

1434
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
House, I get.

1435
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But I don't see the telly tubby.

1436
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That means they don't look...

1437
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Do not look like Tinky Winky nor Dipsy.

1438
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
What if it's AC with heels?

1439
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't know, I think AC is taller.

1440
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
What's this?

1441
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I was gonna say, I recognise this.

1442
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Right, this is AC's tummy, I can tell.

1443
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Oh sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to.

1444
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Oh no, no, no, no, the meds, not the meds, not the meds.

1445
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Don't get digested yet.

1446
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Slow release capsules, slow release capsules.

1447
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Do not digest the meds, okay?

1448
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Do not digest the meds.

1449
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Old hair colour.

1450
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
She was sponding as a junior.

1451
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
My ex would say 2cm mirrors isn't that much.

1452
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Do we laugh?

1453
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Or is this kind of like a therapy confession?

1454
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Wait, what do we do in response to that refling?

1455
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Hello Bobbi, I apologise.

1456
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
No, no, don't apologise for being late, don't worry.

1457
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Point and empathise.

1458
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Oh boy.

1459
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
We pour one out for the whole year.

1460
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
No, don't worry about being late, we're literally just like giffing off doing some puzzles.

1461
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Point and cry.

1462
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Head pat the refling, head pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

1463
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Okay, we're putting AC together, we've managed to do ME,

1464
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
but I guess because AC's face is sideways, you guys are struggling a wee bit.

1465
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Oh is someone trolling?

1466
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Hold on, I think someone's trolling.

1467
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
One second.

1468
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Oh, that's not very nice.

1469
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Here we go.

1470
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Ta-da!

1471
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Ooh, pat, pat, pat, pat, put AC together.

1472
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Pat, pat, pat, pat, put other pieces together.

1473
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That is terrible.

1474
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Tiny, spiny, that is terrible.

1475
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Thank you for the tip.

1476
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
No, we're not doing that.

1477
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh, okay, I'll put the last one on myself then.

1478
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I think everyone disconnected, so technically I put the last piece on myself.

1479
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Ta-da! Look!

1480
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So this artwork, now this was before I had the girls.

1481
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Again, this was before I knew who the girls were and how they're enjoying themselves.

1482
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But AC is two centimeters taller than me.

1483
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And AC has very wide hips and thigh ratio, whereas Emmy's quite plank-like.

1484
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But I don't mean that as an insult, I mean like true to Patan.

1485
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Like she's not very curvy, whereas AC is rather curvy.

1486
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And she does have a little bit of something.

1487
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Ta-da!

1488
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Very important detail for future collaboration.

1489
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
The two little babies arguing over who's taller, even though they're both totally, honestly.

1490
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It gave me one moment.

1491
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Right, what have I got next?

1492
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Right, this one's going to be a super fast one because it's not the most exciting.

1493
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:50,000
This originally was going to be an artwork used for an ASMR video, but I can't use it because...

1494
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Because ASMR on YouTube is rather odd at the moment.

1495
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I'm not really sure.

1496
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I'm not really sure.

1497
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Um...

1498
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Wait, hold on, let me pin it.

1499
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Okay, there we go.

1500
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Patreon won't lay- oh no, Patreon will, but um...

1501
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Yes, good luck with the artwork.

1502
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Now the artwork, I will give you a hint, is very awkward for the background.

1503
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Because the background is a spiral.

1504
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
So I've made this 240 pieces, so I've made it a lot less.

1505
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Image of lungs breathing?

1506
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yeah, breathing, basically.

1507
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You'll see it once you put it together.

1508
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Oh, you've already got my face, hold on.

1509
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
No way, you're that fast.

1510
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You've never even seen the image before.

1511
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
How are you so fast?

1512
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Hello, it's me Anonymous.

1513
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Hmm.

1514
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
How are you so fast at making it?

1515
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
There's a 3D art.

1516
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
No way, you guys are that fast.

1517
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
As high as the background is really difficult because it's like...

1518
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Everything's no mummy.

1519
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh, mummy's looking at the video.

1520
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
No, you can't prove it, no.

1521
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
There's no proof.

1522
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
There's only proof once you've finished the image.

1523
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
That Anon me, everyone in this lobby is me, I am Anon.

1524
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Wait, hold on, let me get out of the way, I'm in the way.

1525
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's strong in time, I love strong calls.

1526
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Hello, it's me Anonymous, there's the 3D art.

1527
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Anon me, everyone in this lobby is me, mummy.

1528
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Your tongue is...

1529
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I can do it twice.

1530
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I made this pose.

1531
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Hypnotizing as if you're licking.

1532
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't know, you're gonna have to find out, you're just gonna have to do the puzzle.

1533
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Anon, we are replaying.

1534
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm gonna see if I can lurk here so you can still see the in-game chat if you wanted to.

1535
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You're licking us.

1536
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
This.

1537
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Okay.

1538
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I never got a custom 3D or asset.

1539
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I'm not really that fuss for like custom assets.

1540
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I hope the girls aren't disappointed with me because I never really did that.

1541
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Like some feature agencies like, oh here's a custom, like game and set up, custom microphone, custom...

1542
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Like, nail asset and I'm just like, I can't really be arsed with that.

1543
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
If the girls want it, they can get it in their donor thoughts.

1544
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Which sounds terrible, but I'm like, I've never been fussed for it.

1545
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's terrible, I really shouldn't do it that way, but...

1546
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
If I'm no fussed for it, the girls then they get it.

1547
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
What's this?

1548
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, you cut my hair together.

1549
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I don't know how I did that on the first go, but I did it.

1550
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So this is called a jigsaw, yeah.

1551
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And you can join in and have fun.

1552
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
We'd let you hypnotise us and destroy humanity.

1553
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah, I don't know if maybe my hearts have been softened by the reeflings

1554
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
and I have been redeemed, if you will.

1555
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And that I no longer wish to perish humanity.

1556
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I'm starting to think that I definitely am having a change of heart to my lore.

1557
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So the reeflings have changed me for the better.

1558
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Their tentacles made all the difference and now I don't want to kill everyone anymore.

1559
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
All thanks to your tentacle reefling.

1560
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah, I don't want to perish humanity anymore.

1561
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Maybe just hold us like cow.

1562
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Right, now this is where this gets really awkward because there's so many hues.

1563
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So many hues and my hair really doesn't help either.

1564
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
My hair makes this so awkward.

1565
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Pen up frustrations and wanting the world to end a timeless combo.

1566
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Stop, I will make that canon.

1567
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Stop, that's such a good lore edit.

1568
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Thank you tiny spiny.

1569
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't know how you guys feel about that, but maybe the reeflings softened my hearts

1570
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
and I realised the problem wasn't humanity.

1571
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
The problem was the high table.

1572
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I am so down.

1573
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And instead of using my hypnosis to take them down,

1574
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I hypnotise you to take them down for me.

1575
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I would abs strongly wick.

1576
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Honestly, down with that, yes, update your lore.

1577
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I just got timed out.

1578
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I think, I don't know if it's like breaking a bit.

1579
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Not all of humanity, just a handful of people.

1580
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Yeah, you use us.

1581
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Well, after you've taken down the high table,

1582
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I have all the time in the world to our word yet.

1583
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Oh my lord, it's like a dosion where the hero smashes the villainess into not being evil anymore.

1584
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Yeah, basically, I will commission that.

1585
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Please do not think I will commission that.

1586
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Maybe I could get like a proper dosion spread.

1587
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I don't know how much they cost though.

1588
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So one shot dosions I think can run like, depending on how many panels you have,

1589
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
shy of a thousand, but like a full on spread.

1590
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I don't even know where you'd commission that honestly.

1591
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Did I see that?

1592
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is it moving your positions?

1593
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Is it actually telling me who's picking up and dropping out?

1594
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Okay.

1595
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Is it our word?

1596
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
If we like it, who knows?

1597
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We don't know yet.

1598
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I know an artist who does 50 per page with four panels a page.

1599
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Yes, I think when it comes to Donothon.

1600
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So, oh, I can't say that yet.

1601
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I can say it tomorrow.

1602
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I think I could say it tomorrow.

1603
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Right, I can't say it just yet, but I'll say it tomorrow.

1604
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
A screenshot when someone keeps moving it.

1605
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Oh my God, what is that?

1606
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
This is giving me a stroke and not a good count.

1607
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That's me.

1608
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That's my thing.

1609
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I think it's lagging out, unfortunately.

1610
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
How do you even move the puzzle?

1611
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's not moving.

1612
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Let me just fix over here.

1613
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'll take the high score off because I don't even see the score.

1614
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The mods turned that wifling into Tokoyaki.

1615
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I came back to Crazy Talk.

1616
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It's not Crazy Talk if it's my lore, okay?

1617
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I'm allowed to have lore.

1618
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
No, that doesn't sit there.

1619
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Oh, I dropped my piece.

1620
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Oops.

1621
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Oh.

1622
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah, we're lagging a little bit.

1623
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Mods, deep fry that wifling.

1624
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
We're breaking the site.

1625
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It's taming out.

1626
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It's the site taming out.

1627
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Oh, something about our wording.

1628
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It was a mis-

1629
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It was a mis-input.

1630
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
It was a mis-input.

1631
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
We're breaking the website stop.

1632
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
That's actually so funny.

1633
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I feel so bad, though.

1634
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Website owners.

1635
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
We're just having fun making puzzles.

1636
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
That's all.

1637
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
They're going to be like,

1638
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
who on earth is this weirdo licking the mic?

1639
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Because they can see the images as it's getting made.

1640
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
They'll be like, what is going on here?

1641
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
So, originally, this artwork was going to be a subscriber milestone,

1642
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
but all of them are going to have to go on Twitter instead for free

1643
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
because YouTube is stinky and it sucks.

1644
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Hello, I'm back.

1645
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Oh, my.

1646
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Yeah, look.

1647
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So, I was originally going to use it,

1648
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
and the artist was really good

1649
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
because I was like,

1650
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
oh, can you just like make-

1651
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
can you do something with a microphone

1652
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
just so it's a bit more unique than a default?

1653
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Don't hold it.

1654
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So, it was going to go on YouTube,

1655
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
but it failed because YouTube is stinky.

1656
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
But that's my artwork, and it's me.

1657
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And I'm so cute.

1658
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And then I asked for like some custom stuff on it,

1659
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
and they just like put me sticker on it.

1660
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm like, yeah, I'll take it.

1661
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I don't think I had your model yet.

1662
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I don't think I had your model yet.

1663
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I don't think I had your model yet.

1664
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I don't think I had your model yet,

1665
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
but if I do get a custom 3DO asset,

1666
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I'm going to get you on it,

1667
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
and I'll be like,

1668
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I'll get a little sticker here,

1669
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and then a little speech,

1670
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and it says, I was R-worded,

1671
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and you're all happy about it.

1672
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
There's something like that.

1673
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I don't know what.

1674
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
And then that's me with my little squiggly,

1675
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
wiggly eye.

1676
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I like the way it does.

1677
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Okay.

1678
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Now I do have...

1679
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Hold on, I'm from my dad's birth.

1680
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm so weird.

1681
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Okay, let me hide it,

1682
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
and then we'll make a new puzzle, okay?

1683
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It's so cute.

1684
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It's so cute.

1685
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Thank you.

1686
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Okay, what's the image?

1687
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Okay, you have a choice of a meme or a comic strip.

1688
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Both involve all the girls.

1689
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Meme?

1690
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Or comic strip?

1691
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Your choice.

1692
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Dayler's choice.

1693
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Comic strip, meme, comic, meme, meme, meme.

1694
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Oh, meme one.

1695
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Okay, meme one.

1696
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Meme one.

1697
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Hold on.

1698
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I am going to do 450 pieces for this one,

1699
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
because it's got all of us in it, okay?

1700
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So don't be shy.

1701
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Do some more.

1702
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Let's see.

1703
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

1704
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Generating puzzle.

1705
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
You ready?

1706
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I know it looks confusing.

1707
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Hold on, I'm putting the puzzle in chat right now.

1708
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Puzzle.

1709
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
This one slightly more difficult,

1710
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
but have a show?

1711
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Have a show?

1712
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Have a goal?

1713
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Have a show?

1714
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Have a show?

1715
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Have a show?

1716
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Have a show?

1717
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Have a show?

1718
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Have a show?

1719
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Have a goal?

1720
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I like that idea of being hypnotized is me to feel it.

1721
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Good luck with this one.

1722
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
This is not an easy one.

1723
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
My fingers is hard.

1724
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I love Johnny Cuddles.

1725
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I love Reefling.

1726
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Are you Reefling Cuddles?

1727
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Is that your full legal name?

1728
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Reefling Cuddles?

1729
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah, Reefling Cuddles would be your full name.

1730
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1731
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
By the Pope.

1732
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Now remember, this is a meme.

1733
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
This is not an easy one.

1734
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Oh, some's already got the bottom corner credit for the artist.

1735
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
We'll take on your last name if you want us to.

1736
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah.

1737
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Are we taking your last name?

1738
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Reefling Cuddles?

1739
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Pipe Jim, we could get a comic for the girls.

1740
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
That would be rad.

1741
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Yeah, of course.

1742
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I would never say no to that.

1743
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
If the girls want comics, I'll make them.

1744
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Someone out there is going to get a legal name change to Reefling Cuddles now.

1745
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That would be pretty badass, sorry,

1746
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
but they would get my used panties in the mail or something,

1747
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
because that's so badass.

1748
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
No, do not actually legalize me for your name.

1749
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
We'd be taking your last name.

1750
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
We have no full name.

1751
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
We have the title, though.

1752
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Reefling the Ink Supplier!

1753
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Reefling the Plentiful,

1754
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Reefling the Bountiful,

1755
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Reefling the Unending Ink...

1756
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Ink...

1757
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Reveal her dosion.

1758
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Let's go.

1759
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I would never say no to that.

1760
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Never say no.

1761
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Making a fake person a name in a mania?

1762
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It's too late.

1763
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I've set it in stone.

1764
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
You've already contacted...

1765
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Oh!

1766
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I see Azura forming.

1767
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I see Emmy.

1768
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I see I see I see Azura on me.

1769
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Sorry, I'm punching the mic right now.

1770
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
My apologies.

1771
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Oh, the bottom.

1772
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
The bottom is starting to show hints.

1773
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Emmy.

1774
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I will very quickly move over

1775
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
just so you can see the bottom is showing hints

1776
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
of what this content is.

1777
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Punch again.

1778
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I'm not punching the mic.

1779
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Fade the mic.

1780
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Boom, boom, boom.

1781
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Resisting the urge to change the name change.

1782
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
The name change...

1783
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
No!

1784
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Elden Ring Boss Drop.

1785
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Reefling the Bountiful.

1786
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
All the Vela girls have their own pills.

1787
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Nice.

1788
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Oh!

1789
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But wait, there's more.

1790
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
There's more to this meme.

1791
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Oh.

1792
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Oh wait, why does it...

1793
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Well, I got bigger.

1794
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah.

1795
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Again there.

1796
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh, what's this?

1797
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Oh!

1798
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Oh!

1799
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Reeflings cracked the case on Azura.

1800
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I repeat, the Reeflings have cracked the case on Azura.

1801
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
What is this artwork all about?

1802
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Oh!

1803
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Reeflings are doing it.

1804
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
They're doing it.

1805
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
They're doing it.

1806
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
They're cracking the case wide open.

1807
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
What is this meme all about?

1808
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
So is it for Gotham?

1809
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Alright, we got Azura packing up.

1810
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Rep it up.

1811
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Stream idea for fstreams?

1812
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Literally this, except...

1813
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah, no, I'd be done for that, that's hilarious.

1814
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Oh my god, we should do a puzzle on Bansley.

1815
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And then we have to all squeeze one out to it.

1816
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And then we wait 15 minutes and then we have to go next!

1817
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I'd be so down for that, that's hilarious.

1818
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Would you change your legal name for a Reefling snack?

1819
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I have to do it?

1820
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
We have to like force ourselves?

1821
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
By the third one all of us are like, we can't go on.

1822
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Go on without us.

1823
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
There'll be one Reefling that's like, you guys are struggling?

1824
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Different kind of endurance stream.

1825
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Oh, the case is getting cracked wide open.

1826
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Oh wow, completely just sealed off the lower section of this meme.

1827
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm loving this, I'm so sorry if it's like low entertainment.

1828
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I am adoring this, like revealing artwork via making you do logic puzzles.

1829
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It is hilarious, I'm sorry, but it is.

1830
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Like, you will be rewarded with new artwork that you haven't seen before,

1831
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
but first you must do this puzzle.

1832
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That's absolutely ridiculous.

1833
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Guys, can you solve a little sorority of rest, honestly?

1834
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It's like why old wizard riddles?

1835
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Astority, this one needs to be poster wall art.

1836
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Oh my god.

1837
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
No.

1838
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Which one of these pills is piagra?

1839
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Stop!

1840
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Why do they ask for which one?

1841
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I think piagra's blue.

1842
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Surely.

1843
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I mean, you guys have done so well, that was not an easy one.

1844
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
You guys keep doing so well, I can't believe it.

1845
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
This is peak iPad entertainment.

1846
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Stop is actually.

1847
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I'm taking the strony fell.

1848
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yes, so this meme concept.

1849
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So I ordered artwork of everyone stepping on the viewer.

1850
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Now, this was before Azura was finalized with her reference sheet.

1851
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Azura is a lot more chocolate in her concept art, and this is what the artist had to use.

1852
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And she's a lot, and she's not even got her markings and stuff.

1853
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You know, this is older.

1854
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But yeah.

1855
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And you can tell this one's older for me, because I have brown, like, apparel things that come out the back.

1856
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
That's when you know it's not my design.

1857
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Again, Shibi has lines instead of ropes, the classic.

1858
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Mercy, no nail polish.

1859
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
No one has nail polish at this stage of development when I ordered this,

1860
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
but I was like, yeah, I want to step on new artwork.

1861
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I'm so red-pilled.

1862
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Skinny Azura jumpscare.

1863
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I cannot tell you how many times I have to go to an artist and be like,

1864
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
make her plump.

1865
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
She's a mummy.

1866
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Literally, she has birthed all of humanity.

1867
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
She got them birth in hips.

1868
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
She got a tummy.

1869
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You know?

1870
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What are you doing?

1871
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
AC censored me live in a society.

1872
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It was very, there we go.

1873
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
You did it.

1874
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
You unlocked the meme.

1875
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Check it out.

1876
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Steps on you.

1877
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Okay, I believe I have one more artwork.

1878
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
But yeah, it was like, pick your pill.

1879
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
The purple, the green, the red, the purple.

1880
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Oh, we didn't think that.

1881
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Wait, what?

1882
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
The light purple, the lilac, I guess.

1883
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And then the purple, the orange, or the blue.

1884
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Purple and purple.

1885
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Hmm.

1886
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Yes.

1887
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Maybe we should have done pink,

1888
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
because Mercy does have a bit of pink in her design.

1889
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
That probably would have been wiser, but hey-ho.

1890
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Pink, but yeah, I would say pink as well.

1891
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'll take all six.

1892
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Are you going to half them all?

1893
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
An ironically great advertisement?

1894
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Oh, really?

1895
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You like that?

1896
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Wait, I'll get this changed to pink,

1897
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
and then we'll put it on the main viewer, kind of, or that.

1898
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And we're done.

1899
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Wait, hold on.

1900
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Let me just double check my files.

1901
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Oh, no, there's...

1902
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Okay, there's an ASMR collab artwork with all of us together.

1903
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It could have made you pink in her teal.

1904
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yes.

1905
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Hi, Fua.

1906
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
There's an ASMR collab artwork,

1907
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
or there is a meme comic strip.

1908
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
ASMR or meme comic strip.

1909
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I didn't see the other image that I had lurking in the shadows.

1910
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Hi.

1911
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
We need to see the art collab.

1912
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
ASMR, ASMR.

1913
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Meme, comic, comic, comic, ASMR.

1914
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Oh, you guys are like 50-50 split, ASMR.

1915
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
All right, we'll do the ASMR,

1916
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
but I'll do 250 pieces.

1917
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
250 blazes.

1918
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Great.

1919
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
This one has the Veiler logo in the background,

1920
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
just for simplicity's sake,

1921
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
because again, it's one of those ones where it's rather on the odd side.

1922
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Puzzle.

1923
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Oh, I like this game where you put it in your own image.

1924
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yes.

1925
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I highly recommend it for streams.

1926
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I'm currently leaking artwork that's never been seen before via puzzles.

1927
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I'm making them do logic puzzles in order to access it.

1928
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's the most bizarre thing Fua.

1929
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
So you should consider it.

1930
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Rustic, thank you for the gen...

1931
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Try again.

1932
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Thank you, Rustic, for the gentifted mentorship.

1933
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
What?

1934
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Hello, Rustic.

1935
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Thank you so much for the gifted 10 memberships to the channel.

1936
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Thank you.

1937
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I really appreciate that.

1938
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And congrats to those who caught it with your face.

1939
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
What was that?

1940
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I'm taking a drink of water right now.

1941
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Oh my gosh.

1942
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm taking a drink of water right now.

1943
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Oh my gosh.

1944
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I'm taking water.

1945
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I need to...

1946
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I think I'm having a nap after this one.

1947
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Thank you for the gifted memberships.

1948
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Oh my god.

1949
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I think I need a good sleep.

1950
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
But I'm okay.

1951
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I could not get that out there.

1952
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Gentifted memberfish?

1953
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
That's not what I said.

1954
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Nice.

1955
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
It's only just having a stroke.

1956
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I'm thinking about the bands these streams a little too much.

1957
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But yes, Fua, I highly recommend leaking artwork

1958
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
via making puzzle streams.

1959
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It's absolutely hilarious.

1960
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Because I'm showing stuff that's not been shown yet.

1961
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And it's just so fun.

1962
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Oh, we already have our canvas.

1963
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Now, it did make it a wee bit easier.

1964
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I didn't do too much.

1965
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Oh yeah?

1966
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Okay, I'm having the time of her life.

1967
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
The gentifted member.

1968
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
How did you jumble those words in perfect sequence?

1969
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I do it quite often.

1970
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I can accidentally swat.

1971
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I take the first letter.

1972
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh god, I'm supposed to say that.

1973
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Knee die, Julie.

1974
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships.

1975
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
That's right.

1976
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I said it right this time.

1977
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
What are you going to do about it, huh?

1978
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Are you disappointed?

1979
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Knee die, Julie.

1980
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
That I said it correctly.

1981
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
20 gifted memberships.

1982
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Okay.

1983
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Thank you so much.

1984
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I appreciate that.

1985
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
You guys are going to end up getting me another emoji slot.

1986
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You know that, right?

1987
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I'm like, people are so fast.

1988
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I'm trying to get a single piece.

1989
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
That reflins are on it like a blood type.

1990
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I did pick out 250 pieces for this one

1991
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
because I didn't know.

1992
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Strongly struggling.

1993
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Strongly is struggling.

1994
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
But congrats to those who caught it with their face.

1995
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And you have access to all the emotes.

1996
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
There's more emotes on the way.

1997
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I promise.

1998
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I have 13 more emotes.

1999
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And give Mercy some room.

2000
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Please excuse me.

2001
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Mommy, the reflins are hogging the shared brain cell.

2002
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Oh, it's okay.

2003
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Sleepy Phoenix.

2004
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Thank you.

2005
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Thank you for the tip.

2006
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
But yes.

2007
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I don't know what happened there.

2008
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I took a drink of water

2009
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
and now I can speak all over again.

2010
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
So that's good.

2011
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That's good.

2012
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
We should make a thousand.

2013
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
It only goes up to 700, I think.

2014
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So this is the next group.

2015
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
ASMR collab.

2016
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
What do you think it is, reflins?

2017
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
What do you think is happening in this collab?

2018
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I got one!

2019
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Yippee!

2020
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Are you squidding me right now?

2021
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Wait, that is so delayed.

2022
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
That is so delayed.

2023
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Thank you again, Sleepy Phoenix.

2024
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Are you okay, YouTube?

2025
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You took a sec.

2026
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I read that quite a moment before.

2027
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Do 1,000 rotated pieces

2028
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
blowing air into our ears?

2029
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Not air.

2030
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Not blowing.

2031
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
A different kind of ASMR.

2032
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
A group kiss?

2033
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
We're sniffing you ASMR.

2034
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
All six of us are sniffing you going

2035
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
but it's binaural sniffing.

2036
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
So six binaural layered sniffing

2037
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
and you're going to be pheromone maxing for us, okay?

2038
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So that's what the next group ASMR collab is with us.

2039
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
It's all about pheromone maxing.

2040
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I hope you're ready for it.

2041
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
The full sniffing experience.

2042
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
That's 12 nostrils to smell every little piece of you.

2043
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
No shower for a month, God, at the big sniff.

2044
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
God, I hope she likes my pheromone stink.

2045
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
With me, everything will be ready for it.

2046
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
But yeah, look, are you humping?

2047
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Are you? Why are you gyrating the image?

2048
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Why are you doing this sexually?

2049
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Briefly.

2050
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2051
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Fucking steady.

2052
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I need a bit of fire play.

2053
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Okay, yeah.

2054
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Oh, there is 1,000 pieces.

2055
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Okay, I don't think I'm going to do it on this image.

2056
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
There's images too difficult to do 1,000 pieces on.

2057
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
We'll do 450 pieces.

2058
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Let's see, 450 blaze it.

2059
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Great room.

2060
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Comic time.

2061
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
So originally, I was going to release a monthly comic on Villalour.

2062
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Like, for the pro, I'm going to sneeze.

2063
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2064
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That was really weird.

2065
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Puzzle.

2066
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

2067
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Sorry, that was a weird one.

2068
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Bless you.

2069
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Thank you, Bill.

2070
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Aggressive sneeze, yeah.

2071
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I'm afraid I'm not.

2072
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Get out of my nose kind of sneeze.

2073
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Okay, now, originally, I was going to do a comic

2074
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
every month kind of Villalour.

2075
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Fun.

2076
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Damn, she busted me sneezes.

2077
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Apparently, it's one-tenth of it.

2078
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Be aggressive on me however you prefer.

2079
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Yes, but the plan kind of failed through

2080
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
because it wasn't going to work out.

2081
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I need like a specific artist type for it

2082
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
and I couldn't get a hold of one.

2083
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And then I got so busy with all the other issues.

2084
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Like I've kind of said, like debut was,

2085
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
the month of May was absolutely horrific.

2086
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Everyone went past deadlines.

2087
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Everyone, like when, even when I was getting sent stuff

2088
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
that was complete, it was like,

2089
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
it was like a joke because there was so many obvious edits

2090
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
and fixes and subtitle issues or whatever

2091
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
and it was just horrible.

2092
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
So yeah, this plan got put on the back burner.

2093
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I'm not really sure.

2094
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I want to do unspeakable things with Strony Cuttles

2095
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
or do you want me to do unspeakable things to you?

2096
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
What one is it?

2097
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Quick.

2098
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
The Wheel of King.

2099
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
What?

2100
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
There's no way you can see that.

2101
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
What?

2102
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Have I shown this before?

2103
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
How could you have guessed that?

2104
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Amy, is that you on and all?

2105
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Is that one of you guys?

2106
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
How could you have guessed that?

2107
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
It's been a tough year at Commission Art.

2108
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's not their fault.

2109
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I think everyone has taken a lot of work

2110
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
because things are getting more expensive.

2111
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Well, yes.

2112
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Some artists unfortunately do over-promise on deadlines.

2113
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
How could you have fricking guessed that?

2114
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I don't know. Zoom in.

2115
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
We can read Mummy.

2116
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Oh, okay.

2117
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Yes.

2118
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
No, there was a lot of developmental issues

2119
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
with Veilor behind the scenes.

2120
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I commissioned stuff well in advance

2121
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
and then it was announced that Veilor's debut was on June 1

2122
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and collectively, I kid you not,

2123
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
every single artist that we were working with

2124
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
saw that and then all of a sudden,

2125
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
my commission that was on track was getting delayed

2126
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
past the deadline I had given

2127
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
and it just became an absolute nightmare.

2128
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So don't be surprised that Gen 2

2129
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
don't have an announcement date

2130
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
until it's actually all ready to go

2131
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
because I am not going through that stress again.

2132
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I literally almost developed a stomach ulcer.

2133
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It was that bad.

2134
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I like Sheeby's chest has been put together.

2135
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Have you put her?

2136
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
You've put together Sheeby's booba.

2137
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
But yes, this was just kind of like a test sample

2138
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
for the comics.

2139
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
This was a draft, a sample, if you will.

2140
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I will give you a hint.

2141
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Mercy is talking to me in the first panel at the top.

2142
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
That is your hint for this puzzle.

2143
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Mercy and I are having a conversation.

2144
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'm sorry it was so stressful.

2145
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I'm still amazed at the amount of what you did

2146
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
to prepare for debuting yourself.

2147
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Yes!

2148
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Everything got put on the back burner for me

2149
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
to make sure the girls and everything was correct.

2150
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Oh, you've already done it.

2151
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Holy shit, you've already got a little scared.

2152
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Well, there you go.

2153
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
You got the comic outline.

2154
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Ta-da!

2155
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Oh, it's gone.

2156
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
But I worked it in the end.

2157
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
That's the most important thing.

2158
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I am absolutely not telling any artists.

2159
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I'm just giving deadlines that are fair.

2160
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Anyway, lessons learned.

2161
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
It was a massive learning curve.

2162
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Honestly, anything new you do in life

2163
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
is a massive learning curve.

2164
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So I'm glad that I had the opportunity to do it.

2165
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
It was a hoot and a holler.

2166
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
If curiosity, which of the girls can draw,

2167
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
all of them have some sort of drawing experience but me.

2168
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I am the only one that has zero skills.

2169
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Literally, my only skill is licking a microphone

2170
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
and I stand by that proudly.

2171
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That's all I got going for me.

2172
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
That and my addiction to reeflings.

2173
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
That's what I got going for me.

2174
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Life's good.

2175
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
That's all I need.

2176
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
That's all I need.

2177
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Life is good.

2178
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
All her skill points went to specific games

2179
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
and her tongue game, honestly.

2180
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
You're a great entertainer.

2181
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Oh, you stop.

2182
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Yeah, you're gonna make me blue.

2183
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Oh, that's not gonna stop you.

2184
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Your voice is hoot too.

2185
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
My actual voice?

2186
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I don't know.

2187
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I feel it in my eyes.

2188
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
That's what I feel like I sound like.

2189
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
That's what I sound like in my head.

2190
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Who said Farky?

2191
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Oh, it's in the comic strip.

2192
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Sorry, it's in the comic strip.

2193
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
A master assassin.

2194
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I am a master assassin in Assassin's Creed.

2195
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
The best game of all time, which we get to play

2196
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
on December...

2197
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
December, October 10th.

2198
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
That's your actual voice?

2199
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Voice, I can't believe it dropped through.

2200
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
October 10th, we're playing Assassin's Creed

2201
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
all over again and I'm so excited.

2202
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I'm so excited.

2203
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I just can't hide.

2204
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
And on October 8th, we're playing Assassin's Creed 2

2205
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and then the next day, we're doing 100% feather run

2206
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
and then we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

2207
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
on my birthday, which I'm so excited about

2208
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
when I get two days.

2209
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Well, it's gonna be a 40-hour event.

2210
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It's crashing again.

2211
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Oh my god.

2212
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Am I allowed to fart? Excuse me.

2213
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Actually, I just want you all to know

2214
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
that...

2215
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Amy...

2216
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I'm gonna out her right now.

2217
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Amy sent me two clips of her farting

2218
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
to be highlighted into a short.

2219
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I did not go seek them out.

2220
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
She sent them because she was like,

2221
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
oh, this is kind of funny.

2222
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I had to send a...

2223
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
a new person that is working with Veal

2224
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
or two clips of Amy farting.

2225
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I'm like, you know, I had to type up a message.

2226
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I'm like, hi.

2227
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Thank you so much for waiting on your first batch of work.

2228
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Here's a link to the clips

2229
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
that the talent Amy has requested to be made into shorts.

2230
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
You have full editing rights.

2231
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
We're not gonna dictate it.

2232
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And the last two clips were her farting.

2233
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Did they think you were joking?

2234
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
She took it on stream.

2235
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Oh, she took it. She took it twice.

2236
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
She forced it out.

2237
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I had to sit and review the clip

2238
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
to send away to make sure it was acceptable

2239
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
to be turned into a short.

2240
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
So I had to listen to Amy go...

2241
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
and then a little took came out.

2242
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And then she's like, did you hear it?

2243
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Did you hear it?

2244
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I did it!

2245
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Like, she was so proud of herself.

2246
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Expelling that air from her guts, honestly.

2247
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
That editor, happy as Larry.

2248
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
No, the editor came back and was like,

2249
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
crass humor like that doesn't normally land.

2250
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Amy not beating the allegations.

2251
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
That's so funny.

2252
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
She even made a face to...

2253
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Where did you even find these girls?

2254
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
The girls found me!

2255
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
That's the best part.

2256
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I'll be here.

2257
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
They were crazy enough to be like,

2258
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
yeah, I want to be a part of that.

2259
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And I'm like, oh, don't mind if I do.

2260
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So anyway, again, as I said,

2261
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
this is just a draft concept of a comic strip

2262
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
that we may or may not do.

2263
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
That's so funny.

2264
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
She's giving us a real girlfriend experience.

2265
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I feel sorry for the guy,

2266
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
but I love my little sister that, honestly.

2267
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
It's a crass noise, alright.

2268
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I don't have my...

2269
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I don't have my set on board open.

2270
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I'm just gonna have to do it myself.

2271
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Eh...

2272
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Shawnee is a master reefling wrangler?

2273
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Oh yeah.

2274
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Ooh boo, tomato, tomato.

2275
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
How about speaking out?

2276
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Why am I all too ill all of a sudden?

2277
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Oh, that one was a whistle note.

2278
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Her LLE came out with me there.

2279
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
No one noticed yesterday,

2280
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Azura's horns and shebe's chest

2281
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
with the little paper on top

2282
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
give birth to the seventh...

2283
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
What?

2284
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
No one noticed, but yesterday,

2285
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Azura's horns and shebe's chest

2286
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
with the little paper on top

2287
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
give birth to the seventh secret member of your...

2288
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
What are you saying?

2289
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I don't know what you're saying.

2290
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
What does that mean?

2291
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Now we just need a Shawnee to enclet...

2292
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
No!

2293
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Well, for my doughnut song, yes!

2294
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
But in general, no!

2295
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
During the VTuber review collab or something?

2296
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Am I going crazy?

2297
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
The paper above a head?

2298
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And there might be ways.

2299
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Who is...

2300
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
You don't need to move the thing anymore,

2301
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Reefland.

2302
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Or is it just lagging out completely?

2303
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
It may be lagging out as well, so...

2304
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Someone keeps shaking it.

2305
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I think it's definitely lagging out

2306
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
because we've overloaded their wee servers.

2307
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
The lag makes me feel like...

2308
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Ooh, so this is the first comic.

2309
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I don't know if it's entertaining enough.

2310
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Maybe I'll get it professionally ironed out.

2311
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
But this was, again, before I knew the girls

2312
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
and the designs and all that jazz.

2313
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
American Idol.

2314
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Ta-da!

2315
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
So the comic goes,

2316
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So, if Vila doesn't do suspensions,

2317
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
how do you punish us?

2318
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
And I say, oh, I just spin the wheel.

2319
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
The wheel?

2320
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
If you misbehave,

2321
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I commission artwork on whatever lands the wheel lands on.

2322
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
And it's like all these, like, stuff

2323
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
that you don't normally do.

2324
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
And everyone goes,

2325
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Well, babe!

2326
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Because we don't do suspensions at Vila.

2327
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I have absolutely no desire to do it.

2328
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I think it's disgusting.

2329
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So, yeah, that was my meme on, like,

2330
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
this is what happened.

2331
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
This is what I do.

2332
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
And then that's my face all serious.

2333
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
That was my first draft of a meme.

2334
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I thought it was rather humorous,

2335
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
but, yeah.

2336
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Oh, StrayPube.

2337
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Bro, when I figured out what StrayPube was,

2338
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I was like, is this for real?

2339
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
But it's a real tag.

2340
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It's funny.

2341
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Um, yeah.

2342
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Serious?

2343
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
More like psychotic reaction image of StrayPube.

2344
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
If you misbehave, Reeflings.

2345
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Um, I think that's all the images I had to share.

2346
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Now, I could do my thumbnails.

2347
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
If you want, very quickly,

2348
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
we could do my thumbnails for the week.

2349
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
They're not too exciting.

2350
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Um, would you like to do that before I go offline, yeah?

2351
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
That's the one in the corner of the mouth, right?

2352
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I hate it.

2353
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It depends.

2354
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I'm in the corner.

2355
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Yes, you want to do my thumbnails.

2356
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Okay, one second.

2357
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I'm just pulling them up now.

2358
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah.

2359
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Drank.

2360
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
How many thumbnails have I got?

2361
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Now, I will make these smaller.

2362
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I think I'm actually going to go back on the Mario Kart one before.

2363
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Anyone's like, I'm really disappointed in that.

2364
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
That was my PC.

2365
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
That wasn't you.

2366
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
My PC takes like a whole five seconds to comprehend that it's just downloaded an image.

2367
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It has such a hissy fit over it.

2368
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I'm definitely going to go back in the Mario Kart one and add you guys in it because...

2369
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Right.

2370
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I'll try.

2371
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I'll test what 50 pieces looks like.

2372
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I don't know, 50 is like far too easy though.

2373
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Okay.

2374
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
No, I feel like 50 is just...

2375
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Fuck it, fuck it.

2376
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
We'll try 50.

2377
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Okay, we'll try 50.

2378
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
It's not a big deal because we have other ones to go through if we want, if we so desire.

2379
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Oh my God, this is far too easy.

2380
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
No, sorry, this is what I see.

2381
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Just so you know, this is what I see.

2382
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
That's far too easy.

2383
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
No, we're not doing that.

2384
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
We'll do 250, believe it.

2385
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
My apologies.

2386
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I thank you guys.

2387
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
My PC hates putting input.

2388
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Oh my God, it hates me.

2389
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Just so you know.

2390
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Only 50...

2391
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
The wiefling is drowning.

2392
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Everyone does one piece each.

2393
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
We have to be organized like that.

2394
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Okay, these are the last...

2395
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
There's seven more to go, but these are the last puzzles.

2396
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
And then we're done!

2397
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
We did it!

2398
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
We did all the puzzles.

2399
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So you can see a little bit of text.

2400
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
You can see there's a red stop sign.

2401
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Maybe some sort of red stop sign.

2402
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I'm glad Mummy did this to me.

2403
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
She likes to do puzzles for other reasons.

2404
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Are you enjoying it?

2405
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I'm glad.

2406
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I feel like it's so fun doing little insider stuff.

2407
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I definitely want to do this in the future

2408
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
when I get more artworks for the girls and stuff.

2409
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Me leaking gen 2 via puzzles!

2410
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Stop!

2411
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Stop!

2412
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
The reason I'm saying stop is because I'm dumb enough

2413
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
to want to try and do that.

2414
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
No, I'm not leaking gen 2 designs.

2415
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Via a fucking puzzle game.

2416
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
So this is my first stream tomorrow,

2417
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
which is

2418
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
drawing

2419
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
your gen 2 suggestions.

2420
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
So what would I put inside the big red sign?

2421
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Alright, I'm lurking for the rest.

2422
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Kisses!

2423
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Thank you for hanging and be playing.

2424
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Yes, I will wrap up the stream,

2425
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
and we will redirect into Shibu!

2426
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Cotton bomb!

2427
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Sorry, I'm having a big stretch.

2428
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
But this was so fun.

2429
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
This was such a little goofy stream.

2430
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Bye-bye!

2431
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Bye-poo-ah!

2432
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Thanks for being chinny,

2433
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
thanks for hanging.

2434
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Alright, I'll zoom in a little bit more.

2435
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
She hates slime girls.

2436
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Yeah, the sign says no slime girls.

2437
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But I already know I'm going to have to draw one.

2438
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I already know I'm going to have to draw one.

2439
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Oh yeah, has anyone said Shibu

2440
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
said she wants to try a G-mod?

2441
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Oh my god, I need to buy the thing.

2442
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I need to buy the game for real, for real.

2443
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Bye-bye-poo-ah!

2444
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Thanks for hanging.

2445
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Thanks for completing the puzzle with this as well.

2446
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
It was fun.

2447
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Please do a puzzle stream

2448
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
and link inside your art of your stuff.

2449
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Your content is so fun.

2450
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I so recommend it.

2451
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh yeah, I really want to see the beat of a prop one.

2452
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I already,

2453
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I hate the feeling of being chased,

2454
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
and I already know I'm going to be screaming

2455
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
and excitement being chased,

2456
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
but if I'm like hating as a prop

2457
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
and like one of them susses me out,

2458
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
thank you for always being so nice and comfy to watch.

2459
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Oh thank you for, what the heck, that's so kind.

2460
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I've returned the compliments to you.

2461
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
You're always a cozy streamer too.

2462
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I saw your post on Twitter

2463
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
with all your nickel variations and that,

2464
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
and I was like, damn, you got some,

2465
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
some alternatives.

2466
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
You got loads of stuff that you can do, which is fantastic.

2467
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Mum is screaming because of us.

2468
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
No, I'm not screaming.

2469
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
But the feeling of being chased

2470
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
gets me like so excited and giddy,

2471
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
and if one of the girls was chasing me in Gmodor,

2472
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
they know I'll be like,

2473
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
like I'll be like burst out laughing

2474
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
because I get nervous laughter with chasing as well.

2475
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I don't know,

2476
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
there's just something like primal in me

2477
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
that gets activated.

2478
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Sorry, the red hue,

2479
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I just realized how awkward the red hue is making this.

2480
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
There's so much red hue.

2481
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Actually, for an ASMR I'm working on,

2482
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
it's gonna be interesting.

2483
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
ASMR, you say?

2484
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
3DO, you say?

2485
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Is that a collab on the horizon?

2486
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
No one will know.

2487
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Teasing, teasing.

2488
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Mummy, you should look into primal play.

2489
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Wait, is that a thing?

2490
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Stop, hold on.

2491
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Am I about to get educated?

2492
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Primal play.

2493
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Primal play centers around the raw feeling

2494
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
and actions and natural impulses,

2495
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
especially urges.

2496
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
And while I understand you are the sub in...

2497
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
What?

2498
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Oh, this is like an article.

2499
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Some people who do primal play switch roles

2500
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
and chase them instead.

2501
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
What the fuck?

2502
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Mummy's a primal play girl.

2503
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Stop, is that what I am?

2504
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I just want something new.

2505
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
What do you think?

2506
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Drawing Gen 2 suggestions.

2507
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
No slime girls!

2508
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
No, who said 3DO, that's gonna...

2509
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I mean, you know, I could just teach me how to do it professionally.

2510
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Oh no!

2511
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Alright, I'll hit you up in the DMs boob and grill them

2512
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
where I got you.

2513
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And Neko this.

2514
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Neko needs...

2515
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Neko needs pamper you to sleep.

2516
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Gotta make it rain.

2517
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Over like a window.

2518
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

2519
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Viscous liquids girl.

2520
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
She smells fresh meat.

2521
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Article trying to call it.

2522
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Literally, I typed in primal prey.

2523
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Can I speak here anymore?

2524
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Insight girl and goblin girls?

2525
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
There's a lot of bang girls.

2526
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
You can ask for what you want.

2527
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I will actually force myself to draw it.

2528
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
You're welcome.

2529
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Yeah, the DVD screensaver.

2530
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Artificial sea war girl, what does it mean?

2531
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Right, I'm hiding it, I'm hiding it.

2532
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Right, next thumbnail.

2533
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
After slime girls, I've completely forgotten.

2534
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Oh, I'm educating you in my special interests.

2535
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Which you're not ready for.

2536
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Which I'm gonna have so much fun making.

2537
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Like I need to do like a big powerpoint presentation.

2538
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
That stream is gonna be so long.

2539
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
If I get carried away, that stream's gonna be so long.

2540
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Okay, next one.

2541
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Making her successors in Gen 2.

2542
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
The goblino reefling girl.

2543
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
A reefling girl version?

2544
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I feel like you guys are a reflection of me though.

2545
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I was gonna get a model update so I can lift up my bangs,

2546
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:03,000
my fringe, and then reveal the nicotine patch on my head as well.

2547
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I love strony calls, I love strony calls.

2548
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Thank you, I love reefling.

2549
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Cuddles.

2550
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Cause that's your surname.

2551
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Strony, what kind of...

2552
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
No, my autistic special interests.

2553
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Not those kind, not those kind of special interests.

2554
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
The autism kind.

2555
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I'm gonna talk about seat dispersal.

2556
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I'm gonna talk about digestive tract.

2557
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'm gonna talk about

2558
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
socialization.

2559
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I'm going to talk about what life was like before capitalism.

2560
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I'm gonna talk about region locked capitalism,

2561
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
which is feudalism.

2562
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I can never say it right.

2563
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I'm also gonna talk about Freud.

2564
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
You know, because he was kind of right

2565
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
and people shunned him.

2566
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I'm gonna talk about what mother's special interests are.

2567
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
The other special kinds are in a different stream.

2568
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Feudalism, that's a feudalism.

2569
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
What kind of seats?

2570
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I'm gonna teach you about seats in general,

2571
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
so you can learn.

2572
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I'm gonna teach you about how farming works

2573
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
and agriculture and that kind of thing.

2574
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Freud was ahead of his time, honestly.

2575
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
That man was onto something and they shunned him

2576
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
all because he had a cocaine addiction, okay?

2577
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
What else are we gonna talk about?

2578
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Probably

2579
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
world war accounts.

2580
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Some information that you might not have known.

2581
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I'm gonna talk about the farming.

2582
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
How farming at home has disappeared.

2583
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Planting at home and growing your own veggies

2584
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
at home has disappeared.

2585
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
More like Sigma Freud.

2586
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Sigma, I mean.

2587
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Freud had a big speech on how he took coke before

2588
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and then the only thing that mattered was he seemed smart.

2589
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Well, cocaine gives...

2590
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh, I really like drugs as well.

2591
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
No, I don't take them.

2592
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I'm interested in the effects they have in the addiction

2593
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,000
and the social perception of addicts.

2594
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Now, this is a conversation for the stream,

2595
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
but I will touch on it now.

2596
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
So, you know when someone says,

2597
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
oh, that person's so addicted

2598
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
that they couldn't give up the drugs for their kids

2599
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
and then they're like, oh, that's disgusting, XYZ.

2600
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
No, motherfucker.

2601
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
That shows you how unbelievably,

2602
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
like, the grip that the narcotics has on that person,

2603
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
it shows you they have...

2604
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
They are unable to reason.

2605
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
It shows you how strong and dependent their body is

2606
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
on this substance, motherfucker.

2607
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Listen up!

2608
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
That's not how it works.

2609
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Literally, people be like, oh, she couldn't beat...

2610
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Like, you know, when you hear stories like, oh, he couldn't beat the addiction.

2611
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
She couldn't beat the addiction for, like, his son, her son or whatever.

2612
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Oh, they're weaker-weaver.

2613
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
No!

2614
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
That shows how un-the-vice-like grip

2615
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
that does not even give them an inch to breathe

2616
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
that the narcotics has on them.

2617
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But anyway, I'm gonna get into that conversation

2618
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
in my special interests.

2619
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
So yeah, you're getting galaxy brain

2620
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
because you're getting educated in my special interests.

2621
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
What if we're addicted to you?

2622
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Um, hopefully I'm not detrimental to your health.

2623
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I hope anyway.

2624
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
But look, it's me!

2625
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Hey, listen!

2626
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Listen to my special interests.

2627
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
You will get to hear them all.

2628
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Where are you going?

2629
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
You're wiggling away like a little worm.

2630
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Mmm.

2631
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
But yes, I also talk about how to reverse, like, the effects of addiction

2632
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
and how it should actually work and, like, how you do it.

2633
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Good night, mommy.

2634
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Gonna ink and go to sleep.

2635
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I love your honesty, Reefling.

2636
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Have an amazing inking session.

2637
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Please remember to say my name when you ink, okay?

2638
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Just a little stronger.

2639
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Okay, that'll do me.

2640
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Thank you.

2641
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Thank you. Good night.

2642
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Okay.

2643
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
How many...

2644
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Wait, have I spelled it wrong?

2645
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Get educated in my special interests.

2646
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Oh.

2647
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Oops.

2648
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Should I leave it in?

2649
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Should I leave it in?

2650
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Because it makes it more like me?

2651
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Me.

2652
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Okay.

2653
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Next thumbnail.

2654
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Right.

2655
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
So then after you've been educated in my special interests, Reefling,

2656
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
next, we are...

2657
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I actually don't know what we're playing.

2658
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Hold on.

2659
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Let me pull up my whole thing.

2660
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
We're playing supermarket simulator.

2661
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
That might get exchanged if I am dumb.

2662
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
And it's apparently a long game, which I had no idea about.

2663
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Oopsies.

2664
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
That was a mistake.

2665
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Genuine mistake.

2666
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
It was a mistake.

2667
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
It was a mis-input.

2668
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Mis-input.

2669
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Puzzle.

2670
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Secret puzzle.

2671
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Secret puzzle.

2672
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Revealing my thumbnail.

2673
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Secret, secret, secret, secret puzzle.

2674
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Wait.

2675
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Where are you doing a collab with Azura?

2676
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I am.

2677
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:23,000
But you're not seeing the thumbnail yet.

2678
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It's a secret.

2679
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
So this is my supermarket thumbnail.

2680
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
No, you guys honing in on the text.

2681
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
You guys are so smart.

2682
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
They're like going straight for the text first.

2683
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
That's so wise.

2684
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
This is a really cool way to post your schedule.

2685
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Yeah.

2686
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I think I'll do a puzzle stream again maybe once I've got more behind the scenes art

2687
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,000
work and stuff to show off because I think it's quite exciting doing it that way.

2688
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
So I'll need to get ordering.

2689
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Chop, chop, scrawny.

2690
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Get ordering some more things.

2691
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
So I gave my lecture to date.

2692
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Despite my lack of preparation, I spoke well and I ascribed to the cocaine I had taken

2693
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
before and I told.

2694
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
So cocaine is really interesting because it gives you an ego.

2695
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I know that sounds crazy because you know, you know people that are unconfident, you

2696
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
know, we've all experienced something like that.

2697
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
A mis-input.

2698
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm going to, I'm going to put something in this mess.

2699
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
All right.

2700
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Okay.

2701
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
That's actually really good.

2702
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
You get, you have been awarded the comment of the day.

2703
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Congrats.

2704
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
That was actually a really good comment.

2705
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I know I sound so sarcastic.

2706
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
It's so funny that I can't laugh.

2707
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
It's that good.

2708
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Okay.

2709
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
What was I saying?

2710
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Oh cocaine.

2711
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
It gives you an ego.

2712
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So when you're unconfident, often you will hear things such as, oh, you know, fake it

2713
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
until you make it.

2714
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Say positive affirmations to yourself.

2715
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
The substance cocaine gives you an ego.

2716
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
It is the most bizarre side effect.

2717
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Truly.

2718
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Sam, thank you for the rose.

2719
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Why is your profile picture a pan?

2720
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Wait, that's not even a pan.

2721
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
That's a walk.

2722
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Why is your profile picture a walk?

2723
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
That's so specific.

2724
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Thank you, Sam, for the rose.

2725
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
You're giving me flowers.

2726
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I appreciate.

2727
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Are we super chats?

2728
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I won't call it super chat.

2729
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
There we go.

2730
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
The booger sugar, honestly.

2731
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Freud was kind of cute, but it was a bit too much.

2732
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It was a bit much.

2733
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
He did.

2734
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I think he did a really messed up experiment with someone's kids at one point.

2735
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
And I was like, oh, Freud, steady on.

2736
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
It's a skillet.

2737
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Isn't that a walk?

2738
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Oh, sorry.

2739
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:47,000
He did.

2740
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,000
And a lot of times the thing's not really scientific.

2741
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of things with Freud.

2742
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I'll do a deep dive.

2743
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I might also talk about Guy Fox because on the 5th of November, a guy called Guy Fox.

2744
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Yeah, his name was literally Guy.

2745
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:11,000
He planned to blow up parliament on the 5th of November, but his plot got foiled.

2746
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:19,000
So on the 5th of November, the UK set of fireworks for it.

2747
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But England celebrate it because his plot got foiled, but Scotland celebrate it because they...

2748
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Yeah, you know what I'm trying to say, right?

2749
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
So fireworks on the 5th of November in Scotland.

2750
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Yeah, we were rooting for him.

2751
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
He had the right idea.

2752
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's a memorial day in Scotland that day for funny reasons.

2753
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
For me, it ends up being microbiology and diseases.

2754
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Ooh, I could talk about diagnoses.

2755
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I quite like them too.

2756
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:06,000
The only problem when you talk about diagnoses, especially when it's genetic disorders or whatever,

2757
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I don't want to use actual pictures of people because that's not very nice.

2758
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Maybe I can get medical drawings to be respectful to the identity.

2759
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I can at least forget Freud because he was the one of the early researchers in the field that was prey.

2760
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
This is my supermarket simulator.

2761
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
I say, bag your own shite.

2762
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
So, I'm going to tell you one thing I don't like about you Aussies.

2763
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Ooh, that's right, Australians.

2764
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I'm calling you out at 6am in the morning.

2765
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:44,000
No, the Australian etiquette is you do not bag your own items.

2766
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
In Scotland, you bag your...

2767
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Put scrawny in the bag.

2768
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
In Scotland, you bag your own items.

2769
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
When I came to Australia and saw that people do not bag their own items,

2770
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I was mortified.

2771
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I watched the most impatient woman ever get her stuff bagged.

2772
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
And I'm like...

2773
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
And she was like, can you hurry up?

2774
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
I'm on a time crunch.

2775
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,000
And I'm like, just if you...

2776
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:19,000
If you bagged it yourself, you would already be in your car driving away to your house.

2777
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Okay?

2778
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Are you squinting me right now?

2779
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Reflin for a month.

2780
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Thank you, little kawakami for the extended membership.

2781
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I appreciate it.

2782
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
You're doing it.

2783
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Right, what comes after?

2784
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Keep forgetting my schedule.

2785
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
As if I'm not the one who freaking made it.

2786
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
And...

2787
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I'm doing ring fit.

2788
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Right, ring fit next.

2789
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Okay, this is a bit of a...

2790
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
It's rather familiar, so don't be too surprised if you recognize it.

2791
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
It's not much of a different layout, okay?

2792
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I confess.

2793
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I must confess.

2794
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I still believe.

2795
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Still believe.

2796
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Right, one more, one more, one more.

2797
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Oh.

2798
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Oh, okay, that was a little bit...

2799
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
One more.

2800
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Thank you for the extended membership again.

2801
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Ritto!

2802
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I probably said your name horrifically wrong.

2803
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Bro, that was one thing about that collab stream with the girls.

2804
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I was saying everyone's name wrong.

2805
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Like horrifically wrong.

2806
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Bags are cashier exclusive where I live.

2807
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
The bag, the stuff, I'll scan it.

2808
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Yeah.

2809
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It's a different everywhere, but I bag my own stuff.

2810
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Thank you, ladrian.

2811
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
You sound like an elf from Lord of the Rings.

2812
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Ladrian.

2813
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Thank you for becoming a member.

2814
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I appreciate it.

2815
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Yeah, I bring a backpack, so I pack my own stuff.

2816
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
And whenever I say to the person that's attending me,

2817
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I'm always like, oh, good morning.

2818
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I'm just going to pack it myself.

2819
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
They're always like, oh, thank you so much, dear.

2820
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And I'm like, ooh.

2821
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And then I always explain, yeah, in Scotland you do it yourself.

2822
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Now, you can't ask for help in Scotland.

2823
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Don't get me wrong.

2824
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
But if you want to be in and out of that shop,

2825
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:16,000
as quick as can be, then I want more of the collab stream.

2826
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It was so funny and cute.

2827
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Well, let's review another girl.

2828
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I think we're probably going to do a tier list,

2829
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
like an actual tier list at some point.

2830
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Now, and before fucking VTubers get their feelings hurt

2831
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
because we're actually ranking them,

2832
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I'll do a meme-y to you, a bit of a meme side, OK?

2833
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
And it would be like, would slap in between your thighs,

2834
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
would lick them or something like that,

2835
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
would put like chocolate cake on them or something.

2836
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I just want all the girls together.

2837
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Aw, you like when we hang out together?

2838
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I find it so fun.

2839
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I already know what the collab is in August,

2840
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
but I'm not going to tell you because it's inside your secrets.

2841
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,000
You're not allowed to know what the collab is in August.

2842
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Howdy.

2843
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Hi, Evelyn.

2844
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
We're currently doing puzzles

2845
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
and I'm making you unlock my thumbnails for the week via puzzles.

2846
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I love Stony Cuddles.

2847
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I love, I love Evelyn Cuddles.

2848
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Alright, keep your secrets, honestly.

2849
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Alright, then keep your secrets.

2850
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Was actually my night elf, George's name and wow.

2851
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Ah, and I told you it was Elvin.

2852
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
And the USA.

2853
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I don't know.

2854
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Brian.

2855
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
In the USA, if you want to bag your own stuff,

2856
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
you just use self-checkout machine.

2857
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Same if you have social anxiety.

2858
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Ah, that's cool.

2859
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
I like that sound.

2860
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Are you squinting me right now?

2861
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Uh,

2862
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Maurizio.

2863
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Did you forget to send a message?

2864
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
You could have typed in that super chat.

2865
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Thank you for giving me your super chat, Cherry.

2866
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Right now.

2867
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
How did I say that?

2868
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Maurizio Rosetti.

2869
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Okay, I can say that part good.

2870
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Thank you for the super chat.

2871
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I appreciate it.

2872
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
And Sam too.

2873
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
You know, there's self-checkout,

2874
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
and if you want to do your own thing,

2875
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
you can use self-checkout,

2876
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
but it depends how much I've got,

2877
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
but I put everything in my backpack,

2878
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
because I rate a bake.

2879
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,000
What are you doing?

2880
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Alright, this is the first time I think USA

2881
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
have a good thing going,

2882
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
sweaty mummy.

2883
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I hope you're ready for it,

2884
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
because I'm going to be a load of anything.

2885
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I'm digging the background music.

2886
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,000
It is a Lo-Fi Elden Ring?

2887
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
No.

2888
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Legend of Zelda non-copyright.

2889
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Ta-da!

2890
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Ring Fito Avento de...

2891
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Where did it go?

2892
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Where did it go?

2893
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I didn't find myself.

2894
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
But that's it.

2895
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
And look at my heart rate.

2896
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
It's 1,380.

2897
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Oh no, it's 138 beats per minute.

2898
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I'm at the last.

2899
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I was like, how, 1,388?

2900
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
No, 138.

2901
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I have no idea what my heart rate max

2902
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
is going to be on the stream,

2903
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
but we'll find out together.

2904
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Mummy in those thighs makes me want to ink.

2905
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Steady on.

2906
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Copyright Lo-Fi Zelda beats to make puzzles.

2907
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
No, not copyright.

2908
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Non-copyright.

2909
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Non-copyright.

2910
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Non-copyright.

2911
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
No copyright, okay?

2912
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Please don't perish from the heart rate.

2913
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
No, I will look after myself.

2914
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Gamer chop.

2915
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
My resting heart rate is like 90 and 100.

2916
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Damn, are you me?

2917
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
But yeah.

2918
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Mummy looks cute in that outfit.

2919
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
You like it?

2920
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
You like my little headband?

2921
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I need to stick on her.

2922
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I like the way you do.

2923
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I'm like, there, there.

2924
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
There's thighs though.

2925
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Okay, how many more thumbnails do we got?

2926
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Will it do a fit?

2927
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Right.

2928
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I will challenge you to 150 to see how unbelievably easy it is.

2929
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Eh, who is next?

2930
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Sakura game.

2931
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Okay.

2932
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Oh, this is ridiculous.

2933
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
This is going to take like no time at all.

2934
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
As long as you guys are having fun though, that's all that matters.

2935
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Right.

2936
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I need to lake.

2937
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I don't even think I'm going to have time to pin this.

2938
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Are you ready?

2939
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Okay, boom.

2940
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I don't even think I have time to pin it before you guys finish it.

2941
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
There we go.

2942
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Replace pin.

2943
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Yeah, this is what 50 pieces is.

2944
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:23,000
This is Suika and not Tsukiyo.

2945
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:31,000
No, this is too quick.

2946
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I am Watamera.

2947
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Mummy's Melons.

2948
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Would you play with Mummy's Melons?

2949
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
There you say.

2950
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
You did it.

2951
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Replay.

2952
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Oh, almost.

2953
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Oh, we're getting edged.

2954
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
We're getting edged with an edge piece.

2955
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Coco Melon.

2956
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
No.

2957
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
There you go.

2958
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Tsukiyo.

2959
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
One big stretch.

2960
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Tsukiyo.

2961
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Wow.

2962
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Okay.

2963
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I switched.

2964
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I'm jumping up and down.

2965
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Boing.

2966
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I'm up on the top corner.

2967
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I'm down on the top corner.

2968
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I'm up again.

2969
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I'm down.

2970
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I'm hovering over gently in the middle.

2971
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Oh, I'm in the other corner.

2972
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
What am I going to do?

2973
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Oh.

2974
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Oh.

2975
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Oh, I'm jumping in them.

2976
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I am diagonal out here.

2977
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Call me Diagon because I'm Diagon Alley Moving.

2978
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
That's absolutely awful.

2979
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
You won the last one to be a thousand pieces.

2980
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I don't even think something else is that good.

2981
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,000
If you want it to be a thousand pieces, sure.

2982
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I'll do as you command my refling.

2983
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Your wish is my command, truly.

2984
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Okay.

2985
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Next we have Azura collab.

2986
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Okay.

2987
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Thumbnail.

2988
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
A thousand pieces and random rotation.

2989
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Are you mad?

2990
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Okay.

2991
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
How about next time?

2992
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
No.

2993
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Maybe we wouldn't do it this time.

2994
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
How about next time we do...

2995
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
What does that say?

2996
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Azura.

2997
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Azura.

2998
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Azura.

2999
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Azura.

3000
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:11,000
The servers are like pleased for the love of God.

3001
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Oh, Azura.

3002
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
What the heck?

3003
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Oh, we're doing a call.

3004
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I'm making the reflings see the thumbnails via puzzles on stream.

3005
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

3006
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I'm putting them to work.

3007
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Hi, Azura.

3008
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Azura, you have not slept.

3009
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I have not slept, so I know for a fact you have not slept.

3010
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Bad gateway.

3011
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Is this the wrong link?

3012
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I was secretly doing the two other puzzles, were you?

3013
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Azura, you have not slept at all.

3014
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
You did such a long stream.

3015
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I don't even know when you went to bed.

3016
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I went to bed and I think you still kept going.

3017
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
It worked, but we overloaded it for a second.

3018
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I love refling cuddles.

3019
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
16 hours of league.

3020
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
You broke the vod and then some.

3021
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Jesus.

3022
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I took a three hour nap.

3023
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
You are going to be perishing during the Yumi Plus concert.

3024
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
You know that, right?

3025
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
You're going to be a piddle, a little piddle on the floor.

3026
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
You're not going to make it.

3027
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
This is me and Azura's thumbnail.

3028
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Azura and I, sorry.

3029
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
It's not me and person.

3030
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Person and I is the proper English.

3031
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Sorry, I know it bothers some people.

3032
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I apologize.

3033
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I was raised in a barn, okay?

3034
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I don't know your customs and your ways.

3035
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Can I drink her?

3036
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Well, if she melted into a puddle.

3037
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
I mean, if you want.

3038
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
The pot's kind of calling the kettle black, here's the lures.

3039
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
No!

3040
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I don't get sleep because...

3041
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Well, yeah.

3042
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Okay.

3043
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
You know what?

3044
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Sometimes you're right, Riflin.

3045
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Sometimes you're maybe on to something.

3046
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I want scrawny curls to R word me so I can cry in the shower afterwards.

3047
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Hang on.

3048
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I don't think you can say that.

3049
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Before anyone says where did I spawn that from?

3050
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
It's in the chat.

3051
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
It's right there.

3052
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Before anyone says where did that spawn from?

3053
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Hang on.

3054
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
You can say that, I lied.

3055
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Real?

3056
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
No, you're not supposed to agree.

3057
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Why?

3058
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
No.

3059
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Why would you cry?

3060
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,000
He did, so it must be legal.

3061
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Twilight Princess music?

3062
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Yeah, you have good ears.

3063
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
That Riflin speaks the truth.

3064
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Cry?

3065
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Cry because it's over?

3066
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
So, baby?

3067
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
When it comes to using me or I,

3068
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
you just have to remove the other person from the sentence

3069
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
and whichever one sounds natural is correct.

3070
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I don't know.

3071
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
What?

3072
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Tiny Spiny?

3073
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
What?

3074
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Thank you for the tip.

3075
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Are you sure?

3076
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,000
No, because it's like Azura and I are playing...

3077
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
We were here.

3078
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I...

3079
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Hmm.

3080
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
What?

3081
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
We only cry because we stopped.

3082
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
You think the devs read this at any point?

3083
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,000
They're currently looking up what Strony Cuddles is

3084
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
and they're being introduced to the world of V-Tubing.

3085
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Love my cuddlefish wife.

3086
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Aww, such a cute nickname.

3087
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I just want Strony Cuddles hugs her peak.

3088
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Yeah, so this is the thumbnail.

3089
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I've colour-coordinated it.

3090
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
It looks green, orange, like my hair,

3091
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
and then blue and purple.

3092
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Someone said Azura's hair is green,

3093
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
but it's like a teal blue, is it not?

3094
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
That Strony lover?

3095
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Me, for real, for real.

3096
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Why are you booing him?

3097
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
He's right.

3098
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
They probably have a bunch of resource usage

3099
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
and they'll check later and wonder.

3100
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
It's Meku colour.

3101
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
So it's blue, right?

3102
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
It looks cyan to me.

3103
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Is cyan blue?

3104
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
It's definitely not teal.

3105
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Well, people were saying her hair was green

3106
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,000
and I'm like, no, my hair is green.

3107
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Closer to green than blue?

3108
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
I don't...

3109
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I see blue.

3110
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I see blue.

3111
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I see blue.

3112
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
I see blue.

3113
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
That was my old account, by the way.

3114
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,000
All of that, me, for real.

3115
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Oh, shit.

3116
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I think we're timing it.

3117
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I think I broke the servers.

3118
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I think I broke the servers.

3119
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Hold on.

3120
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Wait, no.

3121
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Is it still...

3122
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Am I going crazy?

3123
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I thought this one.

3124
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
It's like a sea foam green.

3125
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Sea foam blue?

3126
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Yeah, I thought it was blue.

3127
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I don't know.

3128
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Maybe it's my eyes.

3129
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
But like, if you look at me, you can be like,

3130
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
yeah, Strony's got green in her hair.

3131
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
But if you look at Azura, it's like,

3132
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,000
she's a kind of a blue-purple palette.

3133
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I want the Vealer Girls...

3134
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
The R word, me.

3135
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Reflames!

3136
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
You want us to run a train on you?

3137
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
One by one.

3138
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Or we'll just take a plop at a time.

3139
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
That's terrible.

3140
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I shouldn't encourage it.

3141
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I'm encouraging it.

3142
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I shouldn't.

3143
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I shouldn't.

3144
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It looks close to Aquamarine.

3145
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Aquamines blue water.

3146
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
So, surely.

3147
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Surely.

3148
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Okay, and then after we've done Azura's stream,

3149
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,000
we have Drumroll, please.

3150
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Mario Kart, which I am going to add you guys into it

3151
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
because it's not got you in it,

3152
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
which I don't like.

3153
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I want you in it.

3154
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Nope.

3155
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
That didn't work.

3156
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
That did work, however.

3157
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Puddle!

3158
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
This is the second-last one,

3159
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and then I'm going off and redirecting.

3160
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I'm slightly blue-colorblind,

3161
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
so I don't know, a fuck room.

3162
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
We're as bad as each other right now, god damn!

3163
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Now, this is Mario Kart.

3164
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Are you squidding me right now?

3165
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Broly legend.

3166
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
So, Strongly does the carpet match the drapes.

3167
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
No, there's no carpet.

3168
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Oh, here.

3169
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Oh, wait, no.

3170
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
It's carpet in my head.

3171
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
No.

3172
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Yeah.

3173
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Wait, I get so confused.

3174
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
This is an American term.

3175
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
What does it mean again?

3176
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Carpet is below because curtains are above.

3177
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Right.

3178
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
No, it doesn't.

3179
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't have anything.

3180
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Carpet's other one.

3181
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Sorry.

3182
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
It's like an American sentence,

3183
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:41,000
and I'd never hear it until I entered the internet.

3184
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Shocking, baby.

3185
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Are you posting it again, Anon in the chat?

3186
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I can see it right above me.

3187
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Orange Anon will call you because your text name is orange.

3188
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Love, Strongly cuttles, do I?

3189
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I do.

3190
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Love me, cuttles.

3191
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Love me, cuttlefish.

3192
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Love me.

3193
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Love me, Momay.

3194
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Love me, Dominatrix.

3195
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Love me, Yandere.

3196
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Love me, little sister.

3197
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
And love me.

3198
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
What was it?

3199
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Mezugaki.

3200
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Kuzugaki.

3201
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
My Bratipolar mirror.

3202
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,000
My Bratiprincess.

3203
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Is she your princess?

3204
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Is that that?

3205
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I see princess now.

3206
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Instead of Brat.

3207
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Thank you for the tip, frilly legend.

3208
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Well, speaking of wax,

3209
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:36,000
you'll never guess what one of my Donathon rewards are.

3210
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Wahoo!

3211
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Himagaki.

3212
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:47,000
No, kuzugaki means like shit-talking brat.

3213
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
No way.

3214
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Yeah.

3215
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
I was going to go to a parlor.

3216
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:58,000
That would wax me and give me permission to record the audio.

3217
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I'm obviously going to tip the girl because not only does she have to look at my clam,

3218
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:13,000
if you didn't know, when you get a Brazilian wax, you also have to present your derriere as well.

3219
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
They do your derriere.

3220
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
So I think I have to literally bend over on this table.

3221
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
I don't know what's going to happen,

3222
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:26,000
but I'm going to ask permission to record it for a Donathon reward if we reach it.

3223
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
So that would be a very interesting audio to put out there.

3224
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Once again, I misunderstood when you said record.

3225
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
It's going to be great.

3226
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I'd literally be like, wah!

3227
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
I have no idea what it's going to be like.

3228
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Apparently it's super painful though, like the first time.

3229
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
No, I'm not going to bring the 3D.

3230
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Oh, I'm going to freak her out with that thing.

3231
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:54,000
The audio, not the visuals.

3232
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,000
The audio.

3233
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Good thing I can do this puzzle one-handed.

3234
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Stop! No!

3235
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
How can it not be painful?

3236
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Well, they say if you do it over time, it's not as painful like it isn't sore as sore.

3237
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
The audio is more than enough.

3238
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Stop! That's terrible.

3239
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:27,000
They say the more you do it, the easier it is for the hairs to be pulled out from the root,

3240
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
because that's what you're doing when you wax.

3241
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
You're pulling it from the root.

3242
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:35,000
But the first time you do it will always be the most painful.

3243
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,000
So I'm rather nervous, I'm going to be honest,

3244
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:45,000
but I was going to get like a full wax like my legs, my armpits,

3245
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
and then my clam and all that.

3246
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
So I don't know how long the audio is going to be,

3247
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,000
but I think it's literally going to be me going like...

3248
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:03,000
So over time, you get an iron clam.

3249
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,000
No! You're upgrading my clam.

3250
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Also, can you post pictures afterwards?

3251
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,000
What? You want to see my hairy armpit before and then after?

3252
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I don't think that's very cheeky.

3253
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I maybe do a cheeky armpit picture, I don't know.

3254
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I'd be kind of down for that.

3255
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:32,000
I was going to do a foot photo shoot where I do every interest for imaginable,

3256
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:39,000
like wrinkly foot, oiled up, dirt outside, spread toes.

3257
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Like I was going to do a mega collage of everything and anything you could have wanted.

3258
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Like of, I don't know, more about the taco and the peach for me.

3259
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
No! I'm putting them in a picture of a peach.

3260
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Well the more you do it the rarer it gets.

3261
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Imagine an adamantium clam.

3262
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
It's so op.

3263
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
It's a bit, don't ask them that.

3264
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
They're going to say yeah.

3265
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
My poor reflex.

3266
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Can that be considered a tazadivel?

3267
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Waxing speaks to me because it ingrown hairs.

3268
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Post pics of the wax strips.

3269
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I feel it.

3270
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Oh, I'm not sure about that one, Chief.

3271
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I mean, if you want to, I guess it's natural but I'm not sure about it.

3272
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
The clam will be strong and tight enough to snap tentacles.

3273
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Oh, just inked his pants somewhere.

3274
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Praise be to Talos.

3275
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,000
You'd be surprised how many, like the pheromone pet.

3276
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Let me go snap.

3277
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Right, I'm going to edit this so that's you and that's you and that's you.

3278
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Okay, deal.

3279
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,000
So this one's you and this one's you and this one's you.

3280
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
And then my accord with you.

3281
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Cute face.

3282
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Yeah, you're like my...

3283
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I can't get around the bend because I still don't know how to drift in that game.

3284
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I'm probably going to have to look up a tutorial unironically on how to do that game.

3285
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Can you also run me over?

3286
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Why would I run you over?

3287
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,000
I'll run a train on you but I will not run over with you in an automobile.

3288
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
All those racers, me.

3289
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Literally me.

3290
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
That'll be me.

3291
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Blue shell coming at you.

3292
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,000
No!

3293
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
You want me to edit a blue shell?

3294
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Reflink coming at me?

3295
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
That would actually be really funny.

3296
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Hold on.

3297
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Hold on, you're giving me oil up.

3298
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Who said oil up?

3299
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I've just caught that.

3300
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I want her to outward me.

3301
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
No, don't use the interactive chat in a puzzle game to state your claims.

3302
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Okay, last thumbnail if I'm not mistaken.

3303
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
It's not the most exciting.

3304
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I don't know what this game contains but you guys were like,

3305
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Oh, it's a sad game.

3306
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Okay, so you'll never guess what I did with the thumbnail.

3307
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:11,000
At last but not least, please can I buy the wax strip?

3308
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Funny you mentioned that because I could have sworn I saw a tech talk about a girl that

3309
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,000
made a hundred dollars because she used to sell her wax strips.

3310
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I don't think you're joking.

3311
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I don't think that Reflink's joking.

3312
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'm getting nervous, okay?

3313
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I'm getting shaky.

3314
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
The intimidation music shift.

3315
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Oh no, sorry, I'm not showing the screen.

3316
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Whoopsies.

3317
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Next thing you know, people are asking about Johnny's bathwater.

3318
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I wish I could do that but I feel like I'm like so nasty.

3319
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
I want her to outward me.

3320
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
No, don't use the alternative chat as well.

3321
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
You both can't be started on both sides.

3322
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
That's terrible, Reflink.

3323
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
So I have to enter a puzzle chat to save by all things.

3324
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
No!

3325
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:01,000
This is terrible.

3326
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Alright, we're going to meet them while you're at it.

3327
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Alright, enough, enough, enough, we're getting too far.

3328
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I'm going to get this going to be limited ads.

3329
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I'm going to end up being demonetised.

3330
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Johnny being nasty and more like tasty.

3331
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I love this woman.

3332
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Love you, Terry Reflink.

3333
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Hi!

3334
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Join the queue for...

3335
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Okay, you're done.

3336
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Cutie.

3337
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Now you're in cutie.

3338
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
What I need to do for mom...

3339
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
No!

3340
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
No, no more.

3341
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Filling the database with all these comments.

3342
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Honestly, they're going to be like one error that's going on.

3343
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Gennlain.

3344
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Johnny could probably make bank sale and use...

3345
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Used what?

3346
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Absolutely not.

3347
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Use pads.

3348
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Are you serious?

3349
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Are you guys vampires or something?

3350
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Absolutely not.

3351
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Reflink's kind of freaky.

3352
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Chat restraints.

3353
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Reflects the streamer through and through.

3354
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
That's terrible.

3355
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Fine, no R wording.

3356
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Just go to town, though.

3357
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I'm going to hug this woman until she falls asleep and go flying.

3358
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Funny you mentioned vampires.

3359
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Is that going to be a teabag?

3360
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Is that going to be a teabag?

3361
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
What?

3362
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Funny you mentioned vampire.

3363
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Is that going to be a teabag?

3364
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,000
The pad is going to be a teabag for a vampire?

3365
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Ewww!

3366
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Stop!

3367
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Right, you've won the gross comment of the day, Reflink.

3368
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Congrats.

3369
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Don't...

3370
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Queeflings?

3371
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,000
No.

3372
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
No.

3373
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Absolutely not.

3374
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,000
You guys are not referring to yourselves as fucking queeflings.

3375
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Do I make myself abundantly clear?

3376
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Listen to the tone of my voice.

3377
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:55,000
You are not referring to yourselves as queeflings.

3378
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Absolutely not.

3379
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Absolutely not.

3380
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Why not?

3381
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Why not?

3382
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,000
It is so cursed.

3383
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Don't worry, mummy.

3384
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
We will always be your queeflings.

3385
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
We love you.

3386
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I'm a queefling now.

3387
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Azura, don't encourage them!

3388
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Azura, no!

3389
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Azura, you're going to encourage them!

3390
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:28,000
How many subs for a queefling meme ASMR?

3391
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I don't know how to queef.

3392
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I don't know how to do it.

3393
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Mods, panasura, mods, timasura.

3394
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Kidding.

3395
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Mummy being staring gets us going.

3396
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Call ourselves worst things?

3397
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
No.

3398
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Queeflings...

3399
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
No!

3400
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Right, I'm not reading that word.

3401
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
If I see that word, I'm not reading it.

3402
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Do you understand?

3403
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Start practicing.

3404
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I don't have a word.

3405
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Yeah.

3406
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Name of...

3407
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Oh, that game.

3408
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Yeah, it's a tearjerker.

3409
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Absolutely not.

3410
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Oh, I'm jerking all right.

3411
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Sort of way.

3412
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I don't know what's in it.

3413
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
You guys just told me it was really sad.

3414
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
So I was like, okay.

3415
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Mods, panasura, Azura.

3416
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
She has the wrench.

3417
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Only you and your admins can.

3418
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Oh.

3419
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
She's immune.

3420
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Oh, you guys are fucking...

3421
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Oh, that...

3422
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Azura created the mods.

3423
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
You can't ban her.

3424
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I'll literally...

3425
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Azura is your mummy.

3426
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
How are you going to stop us?

3427
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Going to pin us down and force it out of us?

3428
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Okay, we're back to our word.

3429
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
And that's more like it.

3430
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
That's more like it.

3431
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
If Strani became a muscle mummy, would we switch to beeflings?

3432
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
That's actually kind of humorous.

3433
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I'll give you that one.

3434
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Strani after running a train on the reeflings.

3435
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
She's a queer...

3436
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
We're queeflings now.

3437
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Shut the fuck up.

3438
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Sorry.

3439
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Beeflings?

3440
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Wait, what else is going to mean?

3441
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Meaf...

3442
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Meaflings?

3443
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Beeflings?

3444
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:57,000
When the reeflings are thrown pests on each other,

3445
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
they become beeflings.

3446
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Because it's beeflinging.

3447
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Oh my god, what other words?

3448
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Eaflings?

3449
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Weeflings?

3450
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
See, I'm looking at my keyboard to go through the alphabet.

3451
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Eaflings?

3452
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,000
C-flings?

3453
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
C-flings?

3454
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
C-fling you across...

3455
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I see you and I fling you across the room.

3456
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
D-flings?

3457
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Beeflings?

3458
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
G-flings?

3459
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
G-flings?

3460
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,000
He-flings?

3461
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
G-flings?

3462
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
G-flings?

3463
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Sneeflings?

3464
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
When the reeflings are sick,

3465
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
I talk them in the bed

3466
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
because they're my little sneeflings.

3467
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Oh, that's so cute.

3468
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
With mummy numbs my ears,

3469
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I become a tingling.

3470
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Wait, isn't a tingling the things in Legend of Zelda?

3471
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Aren't they called tinglings?

3472
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,000
If we get too cheesy,

3473
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
are we called brieflings?

3474
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Oh my god, that's so good.

3475
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Fun reeflings go wee flings.

3476
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Sorry, that one was bad.

3477
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
They hold short, they hold swords.

3478
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
We call them sheathlings.

3479
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
When reeflings are upset,

3480
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
they're grieflings.

3481
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I'm loving this, sorry.

3482
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
When the reeflings are gassy,

3483
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
we become que-

3484
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,000
No!

3485
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
No!

3486
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
No, not that one.

3487
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Everyone else, everything good.

3488
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Not that one.

3489
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,000
GG.

3490
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Your tight climb syndrome

3491
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
made me queefing.

3492
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Yeah, I've never,

3493
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I don't know how to do it.

3494
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
So, I'll look up a tutorial.

3495
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I'll look up a tutorial

3496
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
and I'll do it.

3497
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Oh my god.

3498
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Oh my god.

3499
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
That was so good to end on.

3500
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Holy crap.

3501
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
That's all my thumbnails for the week.

3502
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I hope you enjoyed that.

3503
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,000
That was hilarious.

3504
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Oh.

3505
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:56,000
That was so good.

3506
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Alright.

3507
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,000
When mommy post audios,

3508
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
we become stifflings.

3509
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Oh no, I have to edit the audios too.

3510
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I need to edit one of my audios

3511
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
and one of Azuras today.

3512
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I forgot about that.

3513
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Right.

3514
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,000
First, nap.

3515
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Second,

3516
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Umi plus.

3517
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Third,

3518
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
maybe nap again

3519
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
depending on how tired I am.

3520
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
No, I got signed out on my YouTube.

3521
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Are you serious?

3522
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Oh, for god's sake.

3523
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Hold on.

3524
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,000
I don't know why.

3525
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I seem to get signed out on my YouTube so much.

3526
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Hold on.

3527
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Hold on.

3528
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
I need to look into the old.

3529
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I need to look into it.

3530
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
No way.

3531
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Why does it keep signing me out?

3532
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I'm not doing anything against the law here.

3533
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Oh my god.

3534
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I don't think I can redirect.

3535
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I think I'm going to have to go on my other PC

3536
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
because I have two PCs.

3537
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
That's right, baby.

3538
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
And redirect via the other PC

3539
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
then come back here and wrap up stream.

3540
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Does that make sense?

3541
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Or should I wrap up now and disappear?

3542
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
No.

3543
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Because I need to be on in order to do the redirect.

3544
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Man, this is fun.

3545
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
I don't know why I get signed out on YouTube so much.

3546
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I don't know.

3547
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
It's bizarre.

3548
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
We are reeflings in strontiae.

3549
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Our words are...

3550
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
No, no, no.

3551
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
That's not why I called you reeflings.

3552
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I called you them because of the halflings

3553
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
from Lord of the Rings.

3554
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,000
You're not called reeflings

3555
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
because I are a word you on a daily basis.

3556
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
When in doubt, just assume YouTube hates me.

3557
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Yeah, honestly.

3558
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Oh my god.

3559
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I don't even think I have my outro asset.

3560
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
I'm not even kidding.

3561
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I do have an ending screen.

3562
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Do I dare to use it?

3563
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I actually have an ending screen.

3564
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I think we're going to use it

3565
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,000
for the first time ever.

3566
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Wait, so we're all our word halflings?

3567
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
No, that's not why I called you.

3568
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Well, okay, ending screen it is then.

3569
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I've literally not used it.

3570
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I think I used it once for debut and never again.

3571
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
A once in a lifetime event, I dare you.

3572
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Okay.

3573
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Thank you so so much

3574
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
for having such a carry on with me.

3575
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
I hope you enjoyed the artwork reveals

3576
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:28,000
and the fun things that I did have behind the scenes

3577
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
as well as my thumbnails and my schedule.

3578
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
I thought that was really fun.

3579
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Please don't be.

3580
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I might do that again in the future

3581
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
because it was like no download, no hassle,

3582
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
no fuss, no nothing.

3583
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Thank you for puzzling with the puzzles all over you.

3584
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
My puzzle league flings, I tried.

3585
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I'm sorry.

3586
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I love Winston.

3587
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I love you.

3588
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Love you.

3589
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Thank you for enjoying stream.

3590
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I might do that again.

3591
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
If I get more behind the scenes stuff

3592
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
that I can kind of leak via a puzzle

3593
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
because I find that absolutely hilarious.

3594
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I don't know why.

3595
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
It's tickling my pickle in a very good way.

3596
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Okay.

3597
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
That was so fun.

3598
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Thank you for hanging out.

3599
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Next week's stream snipe game is Mario Kart.

3600
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I am going to be going live again today.

3601
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
To watch the Yumi Plus concert.

3602
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I'm just going to make sure.

3603
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I'm just going to make sure what time it's at.

3604
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Okay.

3605
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
It's at 10 a.m.

3606
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
So if I go to bed right now,

3607
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I can get a cheeky two hour sleep.

3608
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Can I tickle your pickle and push the naughty over?

3609
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
No.

3610
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Two weeks.

3611
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Give me two weeks.

3612
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
And then all the thought already begins again.

3613
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:44,000
You give me two weeks and I'll start cooking all over again.

3614
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
But yes, that was so fun.

3615
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Thank you for hanging.

3616
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Thank you for lurking.

3617
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Thank you for doing puzzles.

3618
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Again, Azura came in and did puzzles at one point as well.

3619
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I'm going to use my ending screen.

3620
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I cannot believe it.

3621
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
And then I'm going to run and boot up my PC

3622
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
and then actually redirect into someone.

3623
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Is she be live right now?

3624
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
She better be.

3625
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
She be cotton bum.

3626
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
You better be live right now.

3627
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I'm going to spank you.

3628
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Is there no VR lure girl live?

3629
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Oh no.

3630
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
This can't be.

3631
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Oh.

3632
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Well, if there's no VR lure girl live,

3633
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I'll just...

3634
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
I'll go live.

3635
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Are you going live?

3636
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
What are you going to play?

3637
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Don't say legal legends.

3638
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I've redirected into legal legends too many times Azura.

3639
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
You're getting spanked for it.

3640
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,000
What are you going live with?

3641
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
You want that too?

3642
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
DEMPA's doing a...

3643
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
I can't...

3644
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Don't do it.

3645
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
She's going to play League again.

3646
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Azura, you were showing off your skins at one point

3647
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:57,000
and you were telling us about your favourite character.

3648
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
I've forgotten their name.

3649
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
But they kind of looked like you.

3650
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
And I was like...

3651
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Oh.

3652
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Because they had like big blue hair.

3653
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,000
DEMPA's live right now?

3654
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
One, two inches.

3655
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,000
One, two inches.

3656
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
DEM...

3657
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
I went to bed this morning.

3658
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Azura's still going.

3659
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
She is addicted.

3660
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Coming for my endurance title.

3661
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
How dare you Azura.

3662
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Are you actually going live?

3663
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Or will I redirect into DEMPA?

3664
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,000
If it's DEMPA's birthday, I'll go redirect into DEMPA.

3665
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Azura's legalings?

3666
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Honestly.

3667
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,000
No, no, I was joking.

3668
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
No live.

3669
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I was going to say,

3670
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
you need rest before this little watch long.

3671
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

3672
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Right, I'm going to go redirect into DEMPA

3673
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
because it's her doughnathon.

3674
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
You'll need to give me like two minutes to run

3675
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
and put up my computer and get it set up.

3676
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Is this fucking...

3677
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I have no idea.

3678
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I have...

3679
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

3680
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Hold on, we have a...

3681
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Oh, pause, pause.

3682
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
We might not need the ending screen at all.

3683
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
I repeat, ladies and gentlemen,

3684
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
we might not need that ending screen at all.

3685
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
It will remain a mystery.

3686
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,000
You have even...

3687
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
You have yet to see...

3688
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
You have yet to actually see

3689
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
my stingers as well.

3690
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
I was accessing my files yesterday

3691
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,000
because I was having to send stuff to my editors,

3692
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Arisa, and I was looking at the files

3693
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
and I saw my stinger and I'm like,

3694
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
I have yet to show my actual stingers.

3695
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I have credit on the website

3696
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
for the people who made my stingers,

3697
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
but the actual stingers...

3698
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Are you trolling me?

3699
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Did you say DEMPA is live?

3700
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
When she...

3701
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
No one is live!

3702
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Upcoming, upcoming.

3703
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
I don't see one live person

3704
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
that I'm subscribed to.

3705
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I think they said DEMPA was live.

3706
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Is she live on Twitch?

3707
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Did you think I could redirect on Twitch?

3708
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Are you trolling me?

3709
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Oh, she is live.

3710
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
What the fuck?

3711
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Why did that not show up?

3712
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
That's so dumb.

3713
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Sorry, it never showed up for some reason.

3714
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,000
You were telling the truth.

3715
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I'm so sorry.

3716
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Okay, do you actually want to see

3717
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
the ending screen, to be honest?

3718
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Okay, I'll show you the end.

3719
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
She is though.

3720
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Sorry, it wasn't displayed.

3721
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
I don't know.

3722
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
There are a lot of things displayed at once.

3723
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
You think we're that dumb?

3724
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Well, I'm dumb

3725
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
and sometimes chat's the reflection

3726
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,000
of this dreamer,

3727
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
so what does that make two of us, huh?

3728
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Okay, I'll show it.

3729
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Thank you so much for hanging out

3730
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,000
with me, Reeflings.

3731
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Tomorrow, we will be drawing

3732
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
your stinky gen 2 suggestions.

3733
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
So please keep that in the back of your mind.

3734
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,000
You're welcome to submit it via Marshmallow,

3735
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
or you can do it live in the chat.

3736
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
But if you do Marshmallow,

3737
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
I can probably mentally prepare a bit better

3738
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,000
for what I'm going to draw.

3739
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
So don't be afraid to use Marshmallows.

3740
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Thank you so, so much.

3741
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
I'll see you good for givers tomorrow

3742
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
and I'll put up all my wait rooms and all that.

3743
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
No, I'll see you in Yumi Plus Concert.

3744
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Give me two...

3745
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Three hours.

3746
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Three hours, I'll see you in Yumi Plus Concert.

3747
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Okay, I'll be singing and stuff, okay?

3748
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,000
And then we're going to take notes

3749
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
and then I'm going to ask Yumi Plus and be like,

3750
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:00,000
hey, how the fuck did you do that concert?

3751
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Because I want to do it for my girls.

3752
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Okay, thank you so, so much.

3753
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
I'll see you later today, Reefling.

3754
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,000
But please enjoy Dampock

3755
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
because it's her little birthday.

3756
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Even just lurking in the shadows is helpful, okay?

3757
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Bye-bye!

3758
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Time to use my end screens.

3759
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Oh, who goes there?

3760
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:17,000
I need to...

3761
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Alright, can you hear me?

3762
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Okay, you can.

3763
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,000
This is my actual streamer's ending scene.

3764
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Ta-da!

3765
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I did it.

3766
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I had to censor it because...

3767
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Yeah, it's very...

3768
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
It's very OP.

3769
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Now, let's meet and look at you on my head

3770
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
with your nicotine patch

3771
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
and we both have hypnosis toggles

3772
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,000
because you can technically hypnotise me too, Reefling.

3773
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Did you not know that about your lore?

3774
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:55,000
That you're naughty and you hypnotise me sometime?

3775
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Hmm?

3776
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Yeah.

3777
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Yes, I have Butt Fangs and I have Booba

3778
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
and I had to cover it.

3779
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Don't forget to like and subscribe

3780
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
for the other industry.

3781
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,000
She's actually...

3782
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
It's true, it's real.

3783
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Okay, I'll test out the stingers

3784
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
at another date, okay?

3785
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Need to give us a hypno-ending streamer.

3786
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Yeah, you like it?

3787
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Well, we're listening to...

3788
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Lea Jean de Zelda, but yeah.

3789
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,000
We usually don't have to

3790
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
since you prefer the backfire scenario.

3791
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Honestly, I love it.

3792
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Shove a mirror in my face.

3793
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
I'm going to be right back

3794
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
writing a new marrow right now.

3795
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Okay.

3796
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I don't want to go yet.

3797
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
I'm really enjoying today's stream.

3798
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
That was really fun.

3799
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I enjoyed that.

3800
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
I don't know.

3801
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I like when we do stuff together.

3802
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Does that make me a weirdo?

3803
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
No.

3804
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
It makes me in love with you.

3805
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Thank you.

3806
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,000
That was a really pleasant...

3807
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
I know you can't see my model right now,

3808
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
so I'm just trying.

3809
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
That was an incredibly fun stream.

3810
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I thoroughly enjoyed that.

3811
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:08,000
I really like when we can hang out like that.

3812
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
And I look forward to doing it more.

3813
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Yes, I'll get going.

3814
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I'm going to go for a little chicken nap.

3815
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Maybe squeeze out a little chicken,

3816
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
a little for bread while I'm at it.

3817
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
And then we can watch Yumi Plus together

3818
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
and take notes.

3819
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Love you too, dismembered voice.

3820
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Literally, you can't even see my wee model.

3821
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Spends like a ridiculous amount of money on model.

3822
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Doesn't even use it and just chats on the end and screen.

3823
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
But yeah, it's a really good loop.

3824
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
The loading screens were made by YumiYumiWorks.

3825
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,000
They were fantastic.

3826
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
They were such a good sport about everything.

3827
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
I was like, it is paramount that reeflings are with me.

3828
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Because at first I was going to be the only one

3829
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
that had their mascot in their loading screen.

3830
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:53,000
You're not giving me money because I used my...

3831
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I will send you...

3832
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
I will do the stingers tomorrow, okay?

3833
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:58,000
I will do them tomorrow.

3834
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,000
I need to send them to this PC because they're on my other PC.

3835
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:06,000
I will show you what my stingers look like tomorrow.

3836
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Don't give me money for that though.

3837
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Thank you, Murizyo for the five.

3838
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Don't give me money for doing stuff that an average streamer does.

3839
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:22,000
What's that letter in the middle?

3840
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
An O?

3841
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Strong E?

3842
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Stip, writ, awe, knit, net, eh?

3843
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Unless I'm not understanding.

3844
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:33,000
It feels like I can still hear her voice.

3845
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Pepe hands.

3846
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
No, that was really fun.

3847
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
We'll try Mario Kart.

3848
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
See what's going on.

3849
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
We'll know the world is truly ending when a stream starts

3850
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
and she's using the starting.

3851
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
That's when you know, literally,

3852
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,000
censor hate is always hypnotizing us.

3853
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Stranny.

3854
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I wonder what's behind the veal or what.

3855
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
My butt fangs.

3856
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
You're not really supposed to be showing butt fangs,

3857
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
but I have butt fangs.

3858
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
So does Mercy actually.

3859
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
She's broken as I hear her in my head.

3860
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Stranny.

3861
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Stranny.

3862
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Stranny.

3863
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Stranny.

3864
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Stranny.

3865
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Stranny Gonzalez.

3866
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Forget speedy Gonzalez.

3867
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Stranny Gonzalez.

3868
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,000
One minute fifty-six beat my record right now.

3869
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Hello.

3870
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Hello.

3871
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
I'm about to go.

3872
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Stream's ending.

3873
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I'm just trying to shake.

3874
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Bansley give butt fangs, yes.

3875
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:28,000
I'm gonna see, maybe Nari might work on a nude model for me.

3876
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
I'm not sure.

3877
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I haven't been drawn nude.

3878
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
But maybe Nari'll entertain me.

3879
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Entertain me.

3880
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Stay with me.

3881
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
La la la la la la la la…

3882
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
feeling.

3883
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
And those are not the words at all,

3884
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
I have no idea what the words are.

3885
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Um, actually funny you mention stay with me

3886
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
that song by the way?

3887
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,000
That, I'm making a short about that song.

3888
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
The, I don't know how you did that,

3889
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
but anyway.

3890
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
The thought of that making me unwhysed.

3891
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Yes.

3892
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,000
And we're probably at the karaoke where Dad goes away too.

3893
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,020
I think I'll do ASMR, bathtub is my first stream.

3894
02:45:09,020 --> 02:45:11,760
And then I'll do membership karaoke

3895
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:14,360
just to really give my voice the wham bam

3896
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:16,040
so I have no voice at all.

3897
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:17,000
You have butt fangs?

3898
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:17,840
What coincidence?

3899
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:20,120
I also have fangs and they should meet your butt.

3900
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:23,200
Congrats again on 10k, thank you.

3901
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:26,240
That video propelled us ahead.

3902
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:29,480
That person, that clip, did that highlight reel?

3903
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:30,720
Like fucking threw us ahead.

3904
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:31,880
I'm not listening, right?

3905
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:34,720
I'm going offline, I'm going offline.

3906
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:39,640
Thank you for the very kind and super chat

3907
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:42,120
if it's on YouTube or still a tip, okay?

3908
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:43,800
Thank you for your tip.

3909
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:47,920
Maurizio, I'm absolutely butchering your name, Maurizio.

3910
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:50,120
Okay, I'm going to go for a nap.

3911
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:51,540
I will see you in three hours, okay?

3912
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:53,080
Too many is three hours, okay?

3913
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:53,920
Enjoy your nap.

3914
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:56,360
If you want to nap with me, you can nap with me.

3915
02:45:56,360 --> 02:45:57,680
I'm not going to say no.

3916
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:02,800
Bye-bye, strongy, bye, reef flings.

3917
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:04,960
I read that, but I'm not saying that.

3918
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,640
He's distracted by something.

3919
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:08,120
Mods, get that man.

3920
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:11,080
Okay, good night, I, no, no, good night.

3921
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:13,280
Later, three hours, for goodness sake, woman.

3922
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:15,080
Three hours, enjoy denpa.

3923
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:16,200
Right, give me a big kiss.

3924
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:17,040
Mm.

3925
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:20,400
Three hours, see you in three hours.

3926
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,480
No, good night, stop it, you're confusing me.

3927
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:24,800
But I'm going to bed for a nap, but see you in three hours.

3928
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:26,120
Okay, bye.

3929
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:26,960
Bye-bye, bye.
