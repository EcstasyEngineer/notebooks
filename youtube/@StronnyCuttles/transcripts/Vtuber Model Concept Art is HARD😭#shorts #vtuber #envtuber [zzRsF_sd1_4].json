{"text": " Development can be rough in a VTuber agency and yellow was no different. I knew from the beginning I wanted a hypnosis theme and it took quite a few attempts to become the cuttlefish you know and recognize today. Yes you are allowed to laugh, this was literally my first draft. I quickly was developed to be a cuttlefish early on but I took a very splatoonly vape which wasn't quite what I wanted. Then from this outline you can actually see my shape and pupils are already in place which is amazing. Then a big switch-up happened and I was drawn in a yukata with permanent swirl eyes which was later changed into my classic cuttlefish pupil eyes.
