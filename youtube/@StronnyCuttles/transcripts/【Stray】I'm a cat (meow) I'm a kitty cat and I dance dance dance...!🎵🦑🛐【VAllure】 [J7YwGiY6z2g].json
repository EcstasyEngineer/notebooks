{"text": " Hey? I'm a dreamer even though we're a kitty cat. Cat, I'm a kitty cat. Cat, I'm a kitty cat. And I meow, meow, meow. And I meow, meow, meow. Cat, I'm a kitty cat, and I dance, dance, dance. And I dance, dance, dance. Cat, I'm a kitty cat. Cat, I'm a kitty cat. You guys remember that hit viral YouTube video where the song goes I'm a cat, me and I'm a kitty cat And I dance and dance and dance and dance and dance Yeah, well I remember anyway I don't know if it might be better for me to play games like in the middle of the screen I feel like I'll always cover up something important over here But then I end up getting really tiny, but then if I'm here, it's like well At least I can show my face I can't feel my face when I'm open Heart or heart? Okay, let me explain the hearts I did a bit of, did a bit of work, yeah Did a bit of work So you may notice Good morning Good evening Or good afternoon I'm your host Strony Cuttos Let's get right into the updates Which is hardly any, there's not that much interesting stuff If you are a member of any viewer member, you may notice that there's hearts What do the hearts mean? The hearts are placeholders for where emotes are going to go YouTube is slightly, slightly A little bit, dare I say, a bit based You cannot lose an emotes slot if you bagzian, okay I'm gonna hope that bagzian is a terminology Used by anyone else outside of Scotland But bagzian means it is reserved, if you will My new favourite emotes just dropped, okay Can we keep one heart or moe? Although I think me holding the heart and moe is better than just an emote Bro, I can't even fucking png them But anyway, if you are a member of any girls channel, you will notice that there's moe slots And depending on how many hearts you see is how many slots unlocked AC for example is the first girl to receive her batch So hers is already up Emmys is the next to receive her batch There was a bit of a miscommunication error And by miscommunication error, they just randomly didn't draw one of the emotes we requested And drew one of the emotes we already, like redrew one of the emotes we already had And they were like, here's your delivery And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's not what my little sister wanted And that has to be, I'm glad she caught it actually I sent it to Emmys and I was like, how does it look? Are you happy with it? And she's like, strongy, there's an entire emote missing And one we didn't ask for, and I'm like, you know what Emmys?

Oh No Looks like those look like stars, but they're only light markings Lights marking the hermetic Roof sealing off the city Mankind built the shelter to protect themselves from the outside But I came at a cost nobody can get out The outside was a disaster completely barren unlivable and dangerous But if you come from there, it must mean it's safe again And my promise wasn't just to go to the outside.

I guess we have to go up I Can hear something is it just frogs like ambience or is like is it something that's gonna there's nothing orange though The video game wouldn't be so cruel as to not show orange if there's enemies nearby surely the game wouldn't do that No, those are frogs I'm actually a really good fool Same leg it's never fully healed per thing. Oh No Where they need to go Hold on Hold on I'm about to cross a barrier where they need to go. I can't see Just jump across the bridge and then to the right cuz it's all lit up there Oh you turn hold on this is lit up. Oh Use item An energy drink. Well, it's definitely no way hmm. It's an electrical generator, but it seems to require some other part function. Okay Okay, we're not gonna get jumped on this side, I don't think because of that generator we need to come back to it Did we follow the cable? I think so Okay, when the music gets intense I'll start screaming I Really don't want to make noise. Oh Thank goodness it's in a cage, why is it in a cage because that baits clearly What generate? Uh Hello Is this on its head? Oh, hello Oh Sorry, didn't mean to scare of course the scientist has like crazy cables coming over this here Wow Wait, you're not a zerk. Who are you? That's my badge you're wearing. How'd you find it? Did my son send you? Oh, see miss you clever boy. You've been alone here for oh, I've been alone here for ages I came here to test my defluxor, but it didn't go as planned. I wish I could go back home I miss my son daily You can have a look around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place What do you what do you mean? Wait, you're not gonna say knows what to do remember What do you remember little buddy? I've seen humans wear costumes like I mean similar They were small and running around making lots of noise. Oh, they were children. Yes The streets felt much more alive with children even with the difficulty they brought the adults seem to love them very much Doc says he misses Seamus. Is this the same thing? Yeah, it is. Oh No, no, he's out of beverages. Oh dear What's going on here? Hello radio. Oh Why oh I Was this mean But Morty you go to shove the mega seats. Oh, it does kind of oh, no It does look a wee bit like Rick Hey, be careful with the defluxor at fill charge it can explode zirks like What do you mean be careful give give me it meow This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work and the only thing around here that Kind of just as a generator outside the house. The problem with that is it's not gonna start I think a fuse blew and with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me go and fix it I'm not fast enough, but you might be if you reach the generator and replace the fuse It should be able to get the defluxor recharge. Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what to do Okay, I'm listening. Are you about to give me a weapon? Do I need to not be absolutely terrified and shitting my panty loners? Hmm? Cuz they just we ship my pants when it comes to these bad boys Well, I was actually already at the generator, so I know where to go here take this fuse is brand new Okay, thank you turning on the generator will be allowed to expect company once you fix the generator It should be able to charge The kick and kick start the defluxor you just need to follow this cable change the fuse and meet me back here Best of luck. Okay, so there's gonna be a bit of a jump sequence once we start it, but that's fine. We know where to go Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now surely Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now. No, it's after I do the generator. Okay The game is giving me a grace period. It's either I take a right or a left here Okay, now what were they coming from I can do it I can do it ominous red glow Hey Yes, give me that technology Wait what I can't cross Oh my god, bro, you're gonna need to aim bought this stuff. I can't get across cuz they're coming on the bridge They need to wait until it involves the mall doc you need better aim I Can't even get along the bridge Think I'm okay, okay, you actually didn't do a bad job Why would you do that game You know that would scare me This isn't a horror game. Why would you do that? Get me inside right now? Oh my god Doc is beaming. Yeah, oh you celebrate is so happy hydration chair Amazing you got the generator back on heck. Yeah, dude. You're well. Yeah And how do you see you're welcome in French I've already forgotten Doody and me duty and I Yeah, my voice is unfortunately breaking at the moment Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is it's definitely our way out here wait a minute I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone Oh, that's exactly what I want to hear doc Give me um, you know that guy that smashes like money on the table gif and basically that right now You do not have to tell me twice. Oh Oh, he popped Thank you It works the defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone It's not meant to run off such a small amount of power if you use it too much a kid malfunction Just remember it's dangerous. Now. Let's go back to the village. I'm coming home to my son. Oh That's so adorable You had I do press a No, he's jumping on it. Wait, how do I use it? Oh Yeah, oh My god, okay, it's a wee bit short.

Oh Take out all those darks and we can get through yes Wow, oh, sorry, I did it a bit quicker than the store.

What happened? I'm like looking for routes or anything but I'm being prepared So does any reeflings know where I'm supposed to go? There's bars I didn't there's no point in being inside it I want to say I have to take a right because honestly the game was designed for me to take a right Hold on or maybe I can like go in here. No, I can't You're awesome. There you go. It's hard to figure out like what the game wants you to do when you're Then you know where to go So because like obviously we can't really use the light theory right now. I was like, oh the light will guide you Really the thing's pointing them where I'm supposed to go Danger I don't believe I want to see it Light theory isn't working right now And none of those people are talking to me The meow will gauge you okay, hold on Yeah, I can't talk to you.

Oh god, she's hiding somewhere Uh claim No sign of claim here. Okay. Oh, what's that? It looks like some kind of a coded message We're gonna have to play detective to figure out what happened to her. Look for b12 in the cat the answer lies in my stuff And then there's four symbols What okay, one's a lava lamp. I know that's upstairs the rock is upstairs as well Wait that level lamps right there I Not that level lamp Right the level lamp up here and spit is that we think There's also a hidden message under the container it says I'm with okay And then there was a level lamp up here.

No, the problem is I wake up I don't want to get in trouble I I can't sleep for eight hours is the problem I could do the only time I get a deep sleep is right before stream and Uh, obviously I have to wake up for stream so I don't have like any Solution to my problem Because I need to be meman I Wait, how did I get over here? Um, like obviously it's probably like oh just skip the nap. What? How did I get here? I don't Oh, it must have been the wall Take a day of rest without streaming. No, this sounds terrible. I know for a fact I'll be so mad at myself for not streaming That I would be so upset that I wouldn't actually sleep And then that would annoy me twice as much Um, that would send me into a fit of rage Right, how did I get here?

No Um I'm sure we got given a subway key If the death is not on the screen, it doesn't count exactly John Wick 4 momentum I read an interview by Keanu Reeves because I was so upset And if he apparently begged the directors to make it obvious he had perished and I was like Because he didn't want any of our arbitrary ending Um So I guess the scene of him falling down the stairs was it I think I'm maybe going back Or not at all Boo oh neko like no eco not neko We're actually going to be a train conductor stop.

There's no humans here But the robots haven't evolved City sealed rules of confinement heavy prison sentence City sealed Wow Greetings inhabitant of waltz city 99 the door leading to the surface is currently locked due to a confinement procedure Please refer to any certified engineer inside the control room if you have any requests. Have a nice day It's weird when they don't have a personality They're just Robots Okay Wow, this is weird The control room is closed by some sort of security protocol It says that only humans are authorized also says that i'm not considered human. Hey, that's offensive security protocol Maybe if we work together we can open this passage way Um the control It says why I'm pressing why but it's not doing it. I need to drag something over. Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember this Let's stand on it and see what we can do about this panel Um, can we expect some gender bender and models females? No, I'm not like this Oh Okay Yes, good little spreadsheet. Whoa Oh, it's like I can't scratch it off or open Hmm I need to throw something at it Yeah, there's no gender bender of concepts that are already pre-established like All the designs that have been approved so far like unique concepts. How do I open that panel? Yeah, can I borrow your tool, please? The savings you'll please refer to any certified engineer. Have a nice day. Thank you Do you have a tool that I can borrow?

Okay, this is my Does I need to bring the thing over again? No, it's open I Chant to go to eat us through the high table. Oh, you've guessed the pot. How do you this is the control room for the entire city They controlled everything from here and it's empty I remember hating them so much. They had everything clean space limitless power freedom to move Little good. It did them The plague I remember now Everyone was dying and they thought they were above it all they did nothing to help us I watched my family die. I felt helpless. I couldn't do anything to save them But I can still help you we can still go outside together I will carry the memories of humanity and the people I loved Oh I think we did it anyway, I don't know. This seems pretty end gamey to me not to be dramatic or anything, but I think That's it. That's the main computer I According to the mainframe no one has been here for years The whole city is stuck in a lockdown cycle from long ago if we disable it We should be able to leave we'll need to bring the rest of the systems online These computer holds the data we need we need to turn them on While you do that, I'll look for passwords and encrypted keys to get into that system got it Yeah, understood Okay, turn these on I actually really like areas that don't have freaking anything. Oh That's me turning it on by walking on the keyboard Oh, I can turn the phone. Hell yeah Oh, let me jump that Okay Let's go. Oh, I missed. Sorry. Hold on one moment, please And then done It worked good job my friend. I found it. I know how to open the city something's off here Wait, maybe there's a way around it Roof control stage There that's the workstation to open the city, but there's several layers of security preventing us from using it Okay, that's understandable Now we need to do what we do best me. I'll hack the machines and you destroy some stuff. Yeah Oh, we actually destroyed the high table Oh, so you're hacking what am I doing? This isn't destroying Okay, hold on there's a symbol here Oh Get this off Okay, I will do my job do gel. Yeah, take this high table. Okay, this one In this room Um Oh, there's a second one.

You're literally a circuit board. We can heal you Rift control right go do your thing Oh wait, there's That's it. We're safe Listen I have something to tell you I knew the power requires to disable the city Control center would be immense more than the strong body could handle but never the security disabled I can take control of the system and open the city overriding it would destroy my software Um, I'm pretty sure the software is him By made that choice when I hooked into the first computer Is he gonna die I can't cry I don't want to cry wait no And the consequences it could bring I'm sorry. We won't see that. It's like no I thought I needed to carry on in the memories of humanity to hold on to the past but I Can see a future in the companion than you here. Let me take that off You are my friend my very bad. Oh, no, why why do they have to make it sad? It's literally I gave him a freaking car Mine is thank you.

No, don't put me back here Can at least take them with me Yeah, no, don't no, no, don't sit down. Can I not take them with me? Are you joking I can't even take them with me. Why not? I Bro When the hero never gets the good ending honestly The city is actually open you can freely get in and get out Why does it say like that this city is actually open? There's an old way to freeze it Oh Oh, I'm gonna see my buddies at least Now there's pigeons and shit I can eat And my friends here I'm calling for them Oh Wait, was that him Was he uploaded into the mainframe was that him at the left? Was that him Despite that you're still just the cat I don't like when you cry I fucking can't stand why do the games have to be so mean? Why can't it just always be a happy ending? I mean like shit cameo is a happy ending Like fuck me man Thank you dimsy dan for the cat sticker the neck with sticker They are just old home humans kopium. He took control of the system the drone got fried, but he's up like done in the system Yeah, so there's their stray two coming out and then we can like shove them in a robot and then we live happily ever after Oh Whenever you cry it reminds me what a sweet girl you are. I literally cannae handle it Like why can't we not just like fucking be pod champ? Have you ever played pokemon mystery dungeon? I think so, but I was very young so I didn't understand what was going on Wow Wasn't a model twitching I look like it was the rooms a bit dark so it's probably why He lives happily ever after anyway if there's a straight mean he's gonna have To struggle for it. Don't cry. No, I'm like Why I just wanted to be like one thing. I'm such a crybaby and everyone like literally can't can't beat the crybaby allegations Well, that just thought I was supposed to be like this cool neko game Um, well, you know you're mucking about and like a post-apocalyptic scenario and it's like oh by the way the person That you started with oh the parish and I was like, oh, thanks for that That's really gonna brighten up my day after that. No, seriously that I'm so happy That the person who helped me through the entirety of the game Who helped me translate and speak to all the robots and gave me all this advice and we discovered that was actually a human And they were a scientist. Oh, no, that's lovely that they just perished right at the end No, thanks for that really really cheered up my day really made my heart speed up. Okay. Yeah, like Cute crying mummy cup I don't need to beat the embrace the crybaby embrace that emotion. Honestly. Why? Oh, can't he handle it Oh, but we love her crybaby. Honestly, it's freaking terrible for it So out of 10 Honestly, I have to admit That was a very fair game in the gameplay my only thing is Maybe give a directional point to where you're supposed to go Then again, I can see the argument for being like Look, we've given you signs of where the shops you need to go and I kept stumbling into the puzzle somehow But I do it. I think at the start we took a lot of time I can hear my fucking neighbour in the garden right now I swear to god if he puts on that lawnmower She's sobbing hard. No, I'm no I'm no sobbing. I'm all right Um our little crybaby seaweed. Honestly At least the cat survived. Oh, no, I wouldn't even touch the game I'm sure if the cat perished in the game like everyone I would have heard about it and wouldn't even touch the damn thing Um Now you can't even parley vu with the robots. I know Um, are they confirmed that there's a straight to in production? Hold on. Let me check Straight Let's see is straight to in production Not like you see it in the dark straight who is not confirmed as of yet. Wow. I'm surprised Sorry, I need to sync up my mouse, but I keep them up, don't I? Strony has been keeping the sea salty because of these games. Honestly. I can't stop greeting We say greeting in scots. So yeah, Strony that was four hours. So I guess five hours is to 100% the game Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't really know what you'd get if you 100% assume just as memories I think they're gonna do a different game in the same universe. It is still a pretty recent game. Is it? Oh, okay I just remember when it came out. There was like a lot of hype about it because like no one expected that So Yeah, we're learning That was cute though. Um We'll just say it was 10 out of 10 For me personally, no, however, I can definitely see this appealing to the masses and being very fair Like I think gameplay wise I messed up twice in the entire thing And if I knew what was coming up like once I learned what was coming up, I could avoid what happened. So Yeah, I don't think it's a a wee problem Stray came out in 2020. Okay. No game games take like at least three years development at this point And I think in 8.5 animation and music was good gameplay was simple, but good story was good Story was great um Yeah, I think that was I think it's definitely on the higher for me personally. It's not a 10 out of 10 However, I can completely see where it's a 10 out of 10 for other people like Again fair gameplay wasn't asking me to do like a billion different things at one time I'm sure maybe exploring for people that enjoy exploring, but I don't really enjoy talking to NPCs um that much um I know some people enjoy the dilly dallying, but I don't know for that game I was like, oh, let's go to the net like let's do the next mission. Let's do the next mission Like let's not dilly dally and like stop to talk like I guess cameo is a good example of like I did the whole campaign and I only talked to who I needed to to get my fruits on that This is definitely one of those games of all time from what I've seen I would give an 8.5 and I don't see a need to play it I personally wouldn't replay it, but it is a good game The game is pretty lore heavy, is it? I think maybe yeah, maybe if you solo explored and you know Read everything there was to say and found all the wee secrets and memories and that maybe you know, it'd feel like a bit better Yeah gameplay wise it isn't that appealing. Yeah, it's I would say it's relatively easy Which I quite I'm enjoying an easy gaming experience these days. Like I'm really addicted to baltro But it's so hard not to like slam it down every week. So I'm behaving. I promise there's no baltro for a couple of weeks Um, I've really been enjoying stuff that doesn't require like insane reaction time Because that's like where I get frustrated. I have to like replay the same mission over and over. I do wish we had our aim A cutscene where all the cats got together though. That's a bit annoying. I like understand the cats freeing back on the surface But I wanted it to see its pals, you know, like is that is that too much to ask for chat noir? In a two tail polka dot. Oh, I forgot his name and cally-cally clear. I think Stray is one of those huge Intractable movie type games. I'm gonna not even pretend. I know what that word. We should have baltro Monday. Nah, I've got I've planned a little bit ahead of what streams I'm doing when my dad gets here. Um I've got an Orwell game. I'm not even kidding. It's like a 1984 game. I'm forcing you to play it with me I don't care. I honestly don't care. I'm forcing you to play with me And I'm sticking a tinfoil hat on me when we do the entire gameplay I need to start using like vtuber assets like this more because the ears are so funny Interactable, okay. Yeah, is that a retro game? No, it's like a I don't know. You just like click through the text and stuff I'll read it out though. Don't worry. I'll read it out But yeah, that was good. I enjoyed that. I'm gonna is there any uh veal or girly pops on Yeah, I mean the review said the game takes five hours. So Uh, I really be stumbling very luckily into that stuff. Uh Is there any veal or girls on that I can redirect into just the question She be on Elden Ring. Let's effin go Let's effin go Elden Ring it is time. Rise do you turn is she playing at the proper way or is harem Is harem coming into help her or is she doing it the proper way? As the development team intended, what do you mean you don't play Elden Ring as a multiplayer experience? What are you talking about? It's a perfect multiplayer experience That yours are cute. Read them up it. Let us go. Oh, no, somebody save she be. She hasn't summoned anyone yet Oh my god, she's so brave. I'm like as soon as as soon as I had access to the summoning circles. I was like Come play with mome Oh also, uh all my thumbnails are up like all my streams are up for this week We are playing the jellybean game, which is called fall guys. So if you don't have fall guys Installed please do it for me if you want to play with me. I'd like to play with you. That's okay But I know some people don't like downloading the launcher because I think it's an EA game And I'm sorry if you don't so it's okay if you don't want to download it and play with me because of the launcher because I know it's a thing A real pro gamer not like me Yeah Some girls just like being princess carried in games and some like a challenge I think a lot of people will show you in that game. Yeah, but the reeflings get to touch me and get to jellybean pull on me Not that I had to make a new epic account Hackers tick my your epic freaking account. Wait. Did you spend money on it? All downloaded and ready to go. I just don't like fall guys We were playing other multi game experiences We're actually going to be making puzzles together In a week or so, but I'm going to hate what I'm going to make the image And I'm going to make it really difficult and I'll see if we can do it A bit those of us who have on steam I think you can like play with me. No problem because I just give you the code Who would hate the fortnite launcher? No, it's a fortnite. It's fall guy No money, but I lost some of the free games I claimed. Um Shocking Puzzles with Johnny. Yeah, but I'm going to hide the screen So you don't know what the puzzle is and then I'll give you the link and then we complete the artwork together Um I had to catch up on Isaac So I'm ready for multiplayer when you said this game wants you to suffer. Yeah, you're right I remember why I draw oh the game does not Want you to win it is a punishing game. Um Like I honestly enjoy just playing it casually I've not actually hardcore tried to go for any unlocks in a very long time I should have showed off my unlocks because I had a I've got two Alternative characters that aren't unlocked on Isaac and I keep forgetting to get them But yeah, the game does not like you like I'm pretty sure pretty much all my unlocks are like I randomly stumbled upon an R key. Um, and then did what I needed to do Um, but yeah, that was like a really good experience. Is this freaking shame that I cried honestly I'm such a fucking crybaby. Can he stop it? Um, but that was really good.
