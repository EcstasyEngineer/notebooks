0	2000	Wow...
2000	6000	Tasting, tasting...
16000	18000	My voice is sharp before any...
18000	20000	Yes, get excited!
22000	24000	Testing...
24000	26000	Microphone test...
26000	29000	Ah ah, microphone, okay.
31000	33000	Audio is a freaking thing.
33000	36000	Oh yeah, it's streaming time.
36000	38000	Are you guys there?
38000	41000	Testing...
41000	44000	Oh, YouTube gave me acknowledgement I'm live.
44000	46000	Hello...
46000	48000	Good morning!
48000	50000	Good evening!
50000	52000	Good afternoon!
52000	54000	How are my little wiflings?
56000	58000	Very very sweet!
58000	61000	No one is going to get that reference.
61000	64000	Good morning!
64000	66000	How are you?
66000	71000	I'm currently glowing because of the events that occurred last night.
71000	76000	After a stream that should not be named.
76000	82000	You guys had some very interesting marshmallows for me when I woke up.
82000	86000	I do have some good tiny VLR news.
86000	93000	AC and Emmys second batch of emotes have been accepted and paid for.
93000	96000	So do hold your breath for them.
96000	99000	The girls picked what emotes they want and they were very charming.
99000	101000	I think they're adorable.
101000	107000	Up next is ordering Sheevee and Mersi's emotes.
107000	110000	I'm having to do it in batches.
110000	112000	The wait time is 30 days.
112000	118000	But as soon as they've been accepted it's just something in the background that I don't have to think about.
118000	120000	Which is fantastic.
120000	129000	I am submitting my emotes last because I know how ever so patient my beautiful wiflings can be.
129000	134000	So I do appreciate your patience until the new emotes do show up.
134000	136000	We are getting there.
136000	139000	We will soon be there.
139000	144000	I will do that later.
144000	152000	My voice is short unfortunately but hopefully the microphone is covering up the majority of how badly short it is.
152000	156000	And I think we're just going for it.
156000	158000	We will wait as long as it takes.
158000	162000	I think ours are going to show up in like 40 days which is quite a lot.
162000	169000	Considering how much mome streams.
169000	177000	I'll be a whole second but I mean I see their emotes have been submitted and I get to see the adorable drafts.
177000	182000	The mot artist has already worked on them before so it might be a faster process.
182000	183000	Question mark.
183000	184000	I don't know.
184000	187000	I submitted to them the ref sheet.
187000	189000	They're all the emotes and what they want here.
189000	191000	Time to diminish.
191000	194000	No we are going to save.
194000	197000	I have a cup of tea.
197000	199000	I've got a hot war ball.
199000	206000	I may or may not have slapped myself a little too hard but I hope.
206000	208000	That phantom we saw earlier.
208000	210000	He said he had an ancient king of Hyrule.
210000	211000	What else do we know?
211000	214000	The element was nowhere to be seen in the wind runes.
214000	217000	I guess we'll just have to go to the place marked on our map.
217000	220000	But first you should infuse your sword with that element.
220000	222000	Right okay.
222000	224000	We have just picked up the third element.
224000	226000	The element of water.
226000	227000	Oh the light.
227000	229000	The skulls open up.
229000	231000	Hello.
231000	233000	No.
233000	235000	That's right.
235000	238000	I knew this was here for a child.
238000	245000	Yeah someone was so adorable in message and they were like mome.
245000	247000	I'm like yeah.
252000	254000	They were like mommy.
254000	256000	What hole did you use?
256000	258000	My refund.
258000	260000	Bless you.
260000	262000	Hope.
262000	264000	Brained where are you?
264000	267000	Did my language not unfair?
267000	269000	Where are we going?
269000	272000	I was going to say swimming pool.
272000	274000	Hi Sony what's the transformers last night?
274000	276000	Is this one I've ever had watching a movie?
276000	278000	Oh I'm so glad.
278000	280000	I actually love doing watch-alongs.
280000	282000	Especially like on stuff I've never seen before.
282000	284000	Fucking hell it's going to take forever.
286000	289000	I'm lucky I picked up a bomb sack honestly.
291000	293000	I can't read the site from Marshmallow.
293000	294000	I have no clue.
294000	299000	If you use firefox there should be a little extension for translation.
299000	303000	Unfortunately I don't use anything else but firefox.
304000	309000	But I think you can all translate if you try hard enough.
311000	313000	Wait I can't...
316000	318000	I can't do anything can I?
318000	320000	I can only get this.
325000	328000	Well oh well we got 100 for that.
328000	330000	Oh we can go buy an upgrade on something.
331000	334000	Yeah we cannot do anything.
334000	337000	There's something to the bomb we can do unfortunately.
337000	340000	I'm not sure what that is.
345000	348000	We're currently just exploring because we've got access to the...
348000	350000	Oh no they're having to do a time crunch.
350000	351000	Chomp chomp.
351000	353000	I'm always the last to finish eating.
353000	355000	Oh can't really...
355000	356000	How about you do you...
356000	358000	No no trading.
359000	360000	Oops.
362000	364000	We're dying.
365000	367000	We are very...
373000	376000	We are getting very close to finishing the game.
377000	379000	As far as I'm aware.
381000	384000	I don't have that yet grrr.
385000	387000	Alright we can come back another time.
388000	390000	Oh there's a big guy up there.
390000	392000	Let's go get him.
392000	394000	Shonen's always a fed gopher.
394000	397000	Let's just let them have people eat slow.
399000	401000	You made it here really quickly.
401000	403000	You're filled with surprises aren't you?
406000	408000	It took me like one third of the game.
408000	411000	But sure if you mean getting here quickly.
413000	415000	There you go.
415000	417000	That's so cute.
417000	419000	That looks like...
419000	423000	No one wants to trade Kinstone pieces either.
425000	427000	And here my food I've got stuff to do.
427000	429000	Bruv honestly.
431000	433000	Hello thanks everyone for joining.
435000	439000	I am not going to even pretend I know what's going on with the schedules.
440000	442000	Some people will be online.
442000	444000	Some people will be offline.
448000	450000	That's it. That's all I know.
450000	452000	Don't ask me anymore because I don't know.
452000	453000	What do you say?
457000	459000	You've played this before.
459000	463000	I have. This is a lovely childhood game of mine.
464000	466000	Oh we can give these girls houses.
469000	471000	Who do we think is the best here?
471000	473000	Do we do the green bunches?
473000	475000	Come on green bunches.
475000	477000	Yeah give us green bunches.
480000	484000	No there's something really annoying about this little side quest we're about to do okay?
485000	489000	There will always be one girl that doesn't have a house because they didn't call to end.
491000	492000	It's annoying.
496000	498000	Shira Fanta Fusion Ward.
498000	500000	Well I've just had the best idea.
500000	502000	I can rent out my house for some extra cash.
502000	504000	No not long lords simulator.
504000	505000	We can't escape.
506000	507000	You've made a perfect match.
507000	509000	Singing in forever. What a bother.
510000	512000	It's so nice to be here at last.
512000	514000	We need to find a place to quiet and down.
515000	517000	It's so nice to be here at last in such a big townhouse.
518000	520000	Are these maybe they're a reference to another Zelda game?
523000	526000	So now he can rent out but we need to find someone.
526000	528000	What do you want? Why are you bothering me?
528000	530000	Oh my name is Gorman. I'm trying to hand in real estate.
530000	532000	Turns out I'm a total pain.
532000	534000	It's a total pain right now.
534000	537000	I'm looking for a 10 and you see the thing is I can only rent to a wimp.
539000	542000	Do you guys remember that reddit post that went semi viral?
543000	548000	Where the guy was like looking for a roommate.
549000	552000	But you wouldn't have to pay if you're a woman.
552000	557000	You'd just have to give up the goods basically.
561000	565000	Yeah I don't know if you guys remember that but I do.
565000	567000	And it was pretty wild.
570000	572000	You found me a house yesterday. Go rent.
576000	577000	Oh I remember that.
577000	578000	Yes.
578000	580000	Okay I knew I wasn't the one that knew about it.
580000	582000	That was legit. It was pretty nice.
583000	586000	Right we actually can get access to the rooftop now.
591000	596000	Once we pick up the last item we're going to do a massive amount of exploring.
597000	603000	Because you want to make sure you get naturally due.
604000	606000	Is that supposed to be the lead? No it's not.
610000	612000	So my update last night.
612000	616000	Yeah last night I was doing my research about this game.
617000	622000	No chance. I don't think I can play sub six and make it interesting.
622000	625000	I'm going to be honest. I don't think I can make it interesting.
627000	630000	Strongest, strongest, strongest explorer.
632000	634000	Oh does he want to teach me anything here?
635000	636000	Hello.
636000	638000	Come again when you can jump further.
641000	644000	I never believed Sivir's your kind of game.
644000	648000	It would be fun to just be like scorching it but...
650000	653000	Wait is this going to give me like 50 bombs then?
655000	657000	That's a big bomb bag.
661000	663000	Well you are a big spender thank you.
664000	668000	It does! It gives me 50 so I'm going to have 50 arrows as well.
668000	669000	Okay okay.
671000	674000	I assume the shield doesn't actually give me...
678000	680000	You already have a fine shield.
680000	681000	Yeah I was going to say.
681000	683000	We already have one I'm not sure.
684000	688000	No one seems to want to fuse Kinstone pieces.
691000	693000	Have I like done everyone?
695000	697000	I think I might have done everyone in town.
699000	702000	Strongest big spender and she can handle deposit.
702000	703000	Hope you're having a good day.
703000	706000	Yeah I'm having a cheeky slow morning.
708000	710000	I've got my cup of tea.
710000	713000	I'm just letting it cool down a little bit.
714000	716000	We'll go at the Castello and upgrade our equipment.
718000	719000	We can...
720000	721000	Oh look at that.
721000	722000	Zoom in.
722000	723000	Absolutely zoom in.
724000	726000	I think it would be...
726000	727000	It's a group club idea.
727000	730000	They do an endurance club by each other and so...
732000	737000	Unfortunately the girls can't do that because they need to move out.
737000	740000	Or their parents are going to come flying in the room and be like,
740000	741000	Shut up!
747000	749000	I love hedges!
749000	751000	I love gardening!
751000	753000	It's saving me from the snake!
755000	756000	That's kind of the problem.
756000	757000	That's why I'm always like,
757000	762000	Please support the girls because we have plans of moving to better locations and stuff.
764000	766000	I knew gardening would pay off.
769000	771000	How long is stream today?
771000	772000	I don't know.
772000	774000	It depends how much time we piss off about.
775000	776000	Wow!
781000	783000	I actually don't know how much longer.
783000	784000	Lore-wise?
785000	787000	We only have one more item to unlock.
788000	791000	You're in presence of the true master, Grimblade.
791000	793000	If you train me, you become a master.
793000	794000	Would you like to train?
794000	795000	Yes please.
795000	798000	I think we've only got like four more hours of gameplay.
798000	800000	To learn the meaning of the power of this technique,
800000	803000	you start with first, second, third.
803000	804000	Yeah, sure.
804000	805000	I was listening.
805000	806000	But this is only the beginning.
806000	807000	It comes to real thing.
807000	808000	You must feel the technique.
808000	811000	That's why I will never possess your body.
811000	814000	With the Grimblade possession technique.
814000	815000	Watch this!
817000	819000	Position!
820000	824000	No, I think it will be like four hours.
824000	825000	Oh wow, I can like shoot.
825000	826000	You must try it yourself.
826000	827000	When you're...
828000	830000	Oh, that's such a good thing.
834000	835000	Oh.
835000	836000	No way!
836000	838000	I just like straight up have a laser beam now.
838000	839000	Do you teach me anymore?
839000	840000	You're awesome.
840000	841000	Can you teach me more?
841000	843000	No, there's nothing more I can teach you.
846000	847000	But that's pretty cool.
847000	850000	If I'm full health, I have a bullet now.
853000	854000	Possession.
854000	856000	We refuse this forbidden stream allegation.
856000	857000	Oh my god.
857000	859000	I don't want to know the allegation.
859000	860000	Them allegunkns.
861000	864000	I was outrageous that stream.
864000	867000	But for anyone that gets annoyed with me going
867000	870000	bit, bit, bit for all the bees.
872000	874000	I visit her every hour to have much to offer
874000	875000	but you're welcome to stay.
875000	876000	Stop!
876000	878000	They're so cute and humble.
878000	880000	The stream didn't even get limited ads
880000	882000	even though the context of the stream
882000	884000	is absolutely outrageous.
886000	888000	Oh, the falling trees up.
889000	892000	You can visit the Swordmaster at the lake.
892000	893000	Did I not?
893000	894000	Did we not go back?
895000	897000	I thought we went back.
903000	907000	YouTube ads are such a working system.
908000	909000	Are you guys getting ads?
909000	912000	I told them not to put them on stream.
912000	913000	Wah!
914000	917000	Oh, well, I can definitely go to that lake right now.
922000	923000	What?
926000	927000	She's trying to gain it.
927000	929000	Right, so we basically just don't,
929000	932000	just don't get caught by the AI.
932000	934000	I don't know how severe it is
934000	936000	or if it's like accessible.
938000	941000	Wah, it doesn't seem too bad.
944000	945000	Um...
948000	950000	Who even gets bothered by the bees?
950000	951000	Well, literally, if you're considering,
951000	953000	like, with a hook or something like that.
958000	959000	Here?
960000	961000	That doesn't seem right.
963000	964000	Woah!
964000	965000	No way I did that!
967000	968000	Wait, is there a hidden-
968000	971000	Yeah, okay, let's definitely do the hidden stuff first.
974000	976000	I'm shooting my laser beam!
979000	981000	Oh my god, this is so OP!
981000	983000	Sorry, but actually...
984000	985000	What is here?
997000	999000	Oh, I went the right way.
1001000	1002000	I went the right way.
1004000	1005000	Uh...
1005000	1007000	She's charging my laser.
1007000	1009000	The laser's also two times your sword damage.
1009000	1011000	Are you winning, Strunnion Chat?
1011000	1013000	Yeah, we're infusing the third element!
1013000	1016000	We now are adding the water element to the sword.
1018000	1019000	Which is fantastic.
1019000	1021000	I don't have my blanket and I'm
1021000	1023000	killing the circulation in my leg.
1024000	1026000	It's my pure accident.
1029000	1032000	I don't have access to my alternative Twitter.
1034000	1036000	But I hope that audio did well.
1037000	1039000	The power of the element allows you to
1039000	1041000	split into three copies now.
1042000	1043000	That's cute.
1047000	1049000	We're winning when Strunnion is on the screen.
1051000	1052000	There we go, just like that!
1053000	1054000	The audio was Ace here.
1054000	1055000	What is it?
1056000	1058000	I was like, oh, it's so cringe.
1058000	1061000	Like, I struggle so much to talk when I'm like that.
1062000	1063000	I was just like...
1065000	1066000	Please read me out.
1067000	1069000	I was the best I got.
1069000	1070000	I couldn't do it anymore.
1073000	1074000	Okay, glad you're in.
1079000	1081000	Ah, frickin', not to be...
1085000	1086000	Yikes, my nerve.
1092000	1094000	Sorry, I just woke up.
1102000	1103000	No, I didn't.
1104000	1105000	I didn't.
1105000	1106000	No, you gave me money.
1109000	1110000	I didn't get demonetized.
1110000	1112000	That's what it's saying for people who
1112000	1114000	like hate when I go like burger bing-boot,
1114000	1115000	but it's babas bing-boot.
1116000	1118000	The reason why I brought it up is because
1118000	1119000	we didn't get...
1120000	1121000	Gammy, stop it.
1121000	1122000	Not again.
1123000	1126000	We didn't get demonetized.
1127000	1128000	But thank you for the tip.
1128000	1130000	Thank you for the super chat.
1133000	1135000	Was there something under here?
1137000	1138000	There it was.
1140000	1142000	Burger bing-boot, that is.
1142000	1143000	The bath we knew won.
1143000	1144000	We knew won.
1149000	1150000	We're doing it.
1150000	1151000	I don't know what we're doing,
1151000	1152000	but we're doing it.
1152000	1153000	We're not jumping down.
1156000	1159000	We probably should go gambuzzle shells soon.
1163000	1164000	What do you think, Link?
1164000	1166000	Pretty dark and spooky, isn't it?
1166000	1168000	Makes you want to cry, doesn't it?
1169000	1171000	You're not scared?
1171000	1172000	Well, neither am I.
1172000	1173000	Come on, let's go.
1177000	1179000	I'm actually going to chug my tea.
1179000	1180000	I do apologize.
1184000	1185000	Tell you what, we'll go to Hyrule
1185000	1186000	because it sounds a bit more nice.
1186000	1189000	The background ambiance in Hyrule is a bit nicer.
1190000	1191000	Let me just slurp this tea.
1193000	1197000	But thank you, Broly Legends99 underscore.
1197000	1199000	You're getting very specific with the names here.
1203000	1205000	We're on an adventure.
1205000	1207000	Big Ben Zershin.
1207000	1208000	I have no clue what this is.
1209000	1211000	Like Big Bilbo Baggins.
1211000	1213000	Like Big Bilbo Baggins, Big Plugs.
1215000	1217000	Like Toys, that kind of thing.
1220000	1222000	Algo has no close stroneas.
1222000	1223000	I'm architect.
1223000	1224000	Oh, no, you can say architect
1224000	1226000	because it just sounds like architecture.
1228000	1230000	Don't forget to take them in if you haven't.
1230000	1232000	Oh, I'm already hired, okay.
1233000	1237000	I changed my wind.
1238000	1239000	She's gone, lads.
1241000	1243000	The Vietnamese fucked me up real good
1243000	1245000	but they also have really good food
1245000	1248000	so I'll allow this discretion
1248000	1249000	that has been against me
1249000	1251000	via the Vietnamese.
1251000	1254000	But I forgive you, Vietnamese lady
1254000	1256000	that destroyed my toe.
1260000	1262000	Yeah, I changed it.
1264000	1266000	Healing very beautifully.
1266000	1267000	I'm very happy to say
1267000	1269000	it doesn't look like there's any sign of infection.
1269000	1271000	Doesn't smell like that.
1271000	1273000	Not getting any indication.
1274000	1279000	So I get to put a salt bath for it very...
1280000	1284000	I think in five, well, four days
1285000	1288000	to soak away what I can.
1288000	1290000	They said you can use hot water
1290000	1291000	and swirl it around
1291000	1293000	but it's a bit too sensitive
1293000	1294000	for that at the moment.
1294000	1295000	I'd rather not.
1297000	1299000	But I'll do a salt bath shortly
1299000	1300000	but we're healing nicely.
1300000	1301000	Things are looking good.
1301000	1303000	The painkillers are painkilling.
1306000	1308000	And life is good.
1308000	1309000	I've got a few shorts
1309000	1310000	of the girls coming on the way
1310000	1311000	which I'm excited about.
1311000	1312000	I'm going to put some
1312000	1314000	cheeky advertisement money into
1314000	1315000	as I always do.
1316000	1318000	Mercy's short.
1318000	1320000	I thoroughly enjoyed
1320000	1322000	Shout out to the editor.
1323000	1324000	They just applied themselves
1324000	1325000	on the website
1325000	1326000	and they turned out to be
1326000	1327000	exactly what I was looking for.
1327000	1328000	Edit and style and all.
1328000	1329000	And they've never complained
1329000	1331000	about any of the edits either.
1332000	1333000	I love me.
1333000	1335000	I love me an edit and slave
1335000	1337000	that doesn't complain about work.
1338000	1339000	I love it when you guys
1339000	1340000	still complain
1340000	1342000	and I get to put you at work.
1343000	1346000	But he edited Mercy's
1346000	1347000	Senpai Should I Be Blonde
1347000	1348000	and I've got everyone
1348000	1349000	to do a version of that.
1349000	1351000	I'm about to send that off.
1353000	1354000	Oh no.
1354000	1355000	Strony's removed Tony on chat.
1355000	1356000	No.
1356000	1358000	I'm still here watching mommy.
1358000	1360000	Are you watching me in spirit?
1360000	1361000	Because you no longer exist.
1365000	1366000	We're all willing slaves
1366000	1367000	on this farm.
1367000	1368000	Yes but not for cat-a-wise.
1368000	1369000	Not cat-a-wise.
1369000	1371000	Ever been jealous of an editor?
1371000	1372000	Yeah, me too.
1373000	1374000	I mean...
1377000	1379000	Is it jealousy?
1380000	1381000	Is it jealousy
1381000	1383000	if I'm taking advantage
1385000	1387000	of the editor's hard work?
1387000	1388000	Is it jealousy
1388000	1390000	if I'm taking advantage?
1394000	1395000	Strony was here
1395000	1396000	peeling you in on the new Zelda game.
1396000	1397000	I haven't...
1397000	1398000	I'm still yet to see it actually.
1398000	1399000	I do apologize.
1399000	1400000	However, it looks fantastic.
1400000	1402000	I would watch it live with you guys.
1402000	1403000	But if you didn't know,
1403000	1404000	most game trailers
1404000	1405000	actually get copyrighted.
1407000	1408000	Because for promotional reasons
1408000	1409000	they get permissions
1409000	1410000	of certain songs
1410000	1411000	or additives
1413000	1414000	Yes?
1414000	1415000	It should have been me.
1416000	1417000	If you phrase it like that,
1417000	1418000	yes.
1418000	1419000	Oh, right.
1419000	1420000	Well, fucking relax.
1420000	1421000	You know.
1422000	1424000	I just put the files together.
1424000	1426000	So, can I tell you some secrets?
1426000	1429000	But these are bad secrets, okay?
1429000	1430000	These are bad secrets.
1430000	1431000	No one should know.
1444000	1445000	Oh, Tim...
1445000	1446000	Tim Schrotto.
1447000	1448000	Tim Schrotto.
1448000	1449000	There, see?
1449000	1450000	Netherlands praten.
1450000	1451000	I'm from the Netherlands?
1451000	1452000	Thank you very much.
1452000	1454000	One euro.
1455000	1457000	Thank you very much.
1458000	1459000	Yeah.
1461000	1462000	Streaming must not be named
1462000	1463000	was very useful.
1466000	1467000	I am glad you guys didn't judge me.
1467000	1468000	I honestly thought I was like,
1468000	1470000	relatively like...
1470000	1472000	But, like, you know,
1472000	1473000	I went exploring
1473000	1474000	and I was like,
1474000	1475000	damn,
1475000	1476000	strong a freak.
1476000	1477000	And I'm like,
1478000	1479000	am I actually?
1481000	1483000	Are you guys just scared to explore?
1487000	1488000	Please leave me alone.
1491000	1492000	Gami!
1492000	1495000	Gami, when did you get your hair done?
1495000	1497000	I've seen more degenerates.
1498000	1499000	Yeah, we're up there with you.
1499000	1500000	Okay, thank God.
1500000	1502000	Gami, I see you in that tree.
1502000	1503000	Don't think I don't see you, Gami.
1505000	1506000	Gami, don't be naughty.
1507000	1508000	Gami, that...
1510000	1512000	Okay, that's just a quick way down.
1512000	1514000	Tharya, thank you for coming,
1514000	1515000	a member.
1515000	1516000	Hi, BW.
1517000	1518000	I was...
1519000	1520000	I was like,
1520000	1521000	oh, you need to stay filled in.
1521000	1522000	Right, what's the plan?
1522000	1523000	What's the plan, Batman?
1523000	1524000	Up.
1528000	1529000	What's the plan?
1529000	1530000	What's the plan?
1530000	1531000	You need to tell me the strategies.
1531000	1532000	Left.
1532000	1534000	Hmm, I know what left is.
1534000	1536000	Yes, yes, left.
1538000	1539000	Do you remember as a child,
1539000	1541000	I couldn't do this section?
1541000	1543000	Same as before.
1544000	1545000	Left.
1547000	1548000	Oh, no.
1548000	1550000	I wonder I couldn't do this as a child.
1551000	1553000	Same as the beginning.
1555000	1556000	Up.
1559000	1561000	Up, left, left, up, right.
1564000	1566000	Up, left, left, up, right.
1567000	1569000	Same as two before.
1569000	1571000	Up, left, left,
1571000	1574000	left, up, right.
1574000	1575000	Up.
1577000	1578000	Oh, thank god.
1578000	1580000	Don't ever make me do a logic puzzle again.
1580000	1581000	The disrespect.
1581000	1583000	The disrespect.
1583000	1586000	Make me do a logic puzzle first thing in the morning.
1586000	1587000	There was a key that's needed tomorrow.
1587000	1588000	Okay, a key.
1588000	1590000	Oh, it's a new house.
1590000	1591000	Oh, hello.
1592000	1594000	My name's Dampi.
1594000	1596000	I'm a grave digger.
1596000	1597000	What's that?
1597000	1599000	You were called here by the ghost of the king.
1599000	1601000	That'd be the ancient king of Hyrule who rests here.
1601000	1602000	I've seen him myself.
1602000	1603000	Well, it's just king.
1603000	1605000	I can't see any reason not to let you in here.
1605000	1606000	Take this key.
1607000	1610000	Oh, that was a super easy little safe quest.
1612000	1613000	Mummy do be smart.
1613000	1614000	Well done.
1614000	1616000	Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
1616000	1617000	Gami!
1619000	1621000	Gami.
1621000	1623000	What's with that crow?
1623000	1625000	He up and flew away with a key.
1625000	1627000	Charge after him and get that dang key.
1628000	1629000	I lost the key.
1629000	1630000	Have you got a spare?
1630000	1631000	What?
1631000	1632000	A crow took the key and flew away with the tree.
1632000	1634000	Well, don't just stand around and get the crow.
1634000	1637000	Charge at him and give him that tree a rattle if you want it back.
1644000	1647000	If you stay with a person long of you,
1647000	1648000	spice things up.
1648000	1649000	Oh, yeah?
1649000	1652000	Mellow to spice things up by going in the book.
1653000	1658000	Oh, it was that quick.
1658000	1660000	So we managed to get the key back.
1660000	1661000	Yeah.
1661000	1662000	Okay.
1662000	1664000	Please tell me it's not going to swoop down and yank it
1664000	1666000	and it was just like a little small side thing.
1666000	1667000	I'll open the gate for you.
1667000	1669000	Be careful this time though.
1669000	1670000	Hello.
1670000	1672000	I'm going to kill you.
1672000	1674000	Hello.
1674000	1676000	Yeah, let's fuse.
1677000	1680000	I love crows but that behavior is unexpected.
1681000	1685000	Oh, we never played that.
1685000	1686000	What does it do?
1686000	1687000	What have we just done?
1687000	1689000	Hey, I've just had a great idea.
1689000	1691000	This will add you a little more risk.
1691000	1692000	I'm so excited.
1694000	1695000	Curious.
1696000	1697000	They fit perfectly.
1697000	1698000	Hi.
1698000	1699000	What are you doing here?
1699000	1700000	This is a graveyard.
1700000	1701000	There's ghosts here.
1701000	1702000	Oh, yeah.
1702000	1703000	Speaking of which, my brother lives in town.
1703000	1704000	He's a troublemaker prankster,
1704000	1706000	but I often wonder what he's doing.
1707000	1708000	Push.
1708000	1709000	No.
1709000	1710000	No.
1710000	1711000	Wait.
1712000	1714000	Why did that give me a noise though?
1714000	1715000	Did he dig the grave?
1715000	1716000	Surely not.
1718000	1719000	Okay.
1719000	1720000	Yeah, we're not doing that.
1720000	1721000	How about this?
1721000	1722000	No.
1723000	1725000	Oh, okay.
1725000	1727000	We need to push through graves at a time.
1730000	1732000	Oh, we need to hit those buttons.
1733000	1735000	Wait, are these like all secret graves?
1736000	1739000	No great braving for our shock and behavior.
1739000	1740000	Look, I'm a child.
1740000	1742000	I don't know the implicate.
1742000	1744000	Why would I move that one?
1747000	1749000	And why did it give me the do-do-do-do-do-do-do?
1749000	1750000	Oh.
1752000	1753000	Can I do it?
1753000	1754000	I can.
1755000	1756000	Can I?
1756000	1757000	Is that three or four?
1758000	1759000	I took my legs off.
1760000	1762000	Oh, let's go.
1762000	1763000	You got a piece of heart.
1765000	1767000	Dang straight, I got a piece of heart.
1767000	1769000	I'm just so good, baby.
1769000	1771000	So this one didn't move.
1772000	1774000	I wonder if the king's grave is up there.
1774000	1775000	Surely a mystery.
1775000	1776000	We'll never know.
1776000	1778000	Okay, let's try this again.
1780000	1781000	No, no.
1781000	1784000	It's just grave discovery.
1784000	1788000	How do I get over there without breaking my guys?
1790000	1791000	Oh.
1791000	1794000	I can just like pass through stuff.
1796000	1797000	Oh.
1802000	1803000	Oh.
1803000	1805000	It may be the royal crepe, but graves are creepy.
1805000	1808000	No matter where they are, where is the king's supposed to meet?
1809000	1810000	I'm good stuff.
1810000	1811000	I'm not so sure.
1811000	1812000	I even want to help anymore.
1812000	1814000	Can we just go somewhere that's less creepy?
1816000	1818000	Oh my God, he took a hammer in.
1818000	1819000	He took a hammer in.
1822000	1824000	I'm doing aimbot from halfway through.
1824000	1826000	I'm literally sniping him from the map.
1826000	1828000	So that's horrifying.
1830000	1831000	Oh no.
1831000	1832000	What one is it?
1832000	1833000	Is it this one?
1833000	1835000	Because I can see a platform there.
1839000	1841000	Right replaying.
1841000	1843000	Middle left or right?
1844000	1846000	We just wanted to hold.
1846000	1848000	You can burn the mummies with a lamp.
1848000	1850000	Right, get that lamp right here.
1851000	1853000	Middle was first.
1855000	1858000	Oh, it doesn't make a difference.
1858000	1860000	What's going on here?
1862000	1864000	What's going on?
1864000	1865000	Ah.
1874000	1877000	Oh wow, that disappeared so quick.
1890000	1891000	Okay, okay, okay.
1891000	1893000	I was getting a bit worried.
1893000	1896000	I was getting a bit nervous that nothing was going to occur there.
1897000	1899000	Oh no.
1900000	1902000	This is not good.
1903000	1904000	Do I have time?
1907000	1908000	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
1908000	1910000	Okay, that was freaking lucky.
1910000	1912000	Because that was not good.
1913000	1914000	That was not good.
1914000	1915000	But we did it.
1915000	1916000	We did it.
1916000	1918000	We did whatever challenge was necessary.
1919000	1922000	Further into the...
1924000	1925000	You...
1925000	1929000	The devs knew exactly what they were doing putting that there.
1929000	1932000	That is so cheeky, honestly.
1935000	1938000	Well, this totally doesn't look like a battle dome.
1938000	1939000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1939000	1940000	How do I put them on fire?
1941000	1943000	How do I put them on fire?
1943000	1944000	Oh.
1944000	1946000	I need to give it a drive by.
1947000	1949000	You didn't tell me there were scallies underneath.
1953000	1956000	Of course the fires start attacking me too.
1957000	1959000	Oh wow, we like sped on that.
1959000	1961000	We didn't even have to go left or right.
1977000	1980000	Yeah, can you speed it up a bit, mate?
1985000	1986000	Yeah, a bit quicker.
1986000	1987000	I've not got all day, mate.
2002000	2004000	Yeah, a bit faster.
2006000	2008000	You got a canstone piece.
2008000	2011000	These mystic stones are said to bring happiness.
2012000	2013000	Fascinating.
2013000	2015000	An ancient king of Hyrule.
2015000	2016000	How strange.
2016000	2018000	And the source of the flow.
2018000	2019000	What's that supposed to mean?
2019000	2021000	Her fanny, mate, obviously.
2022000	2024000	Wait, no, you kicked me out.
2024000	2026000	I didn't finish exploring.
2026000	2028000	Let me back in.
2029000	2031000	Wait, did I even have a key?
2036000	2038000	Oh, they're fake doors.
2039000	2040000	No way.
2042000	2044000	Oh wait, how did I get back?
2046000	2048000	Oh, suck, suck, suck, suck.
2049000	2050000	Mumbo.
2051000	2053000	I was like, you said it enough.
2057000	2059000	A little cheeky suckage there.
2059000	2061000	I got nervous there, right.
2061000	2065000	We'll go thank the graveyard guy for letting me in.
2066000	2067000	Thank you.
2067000	2068000	Oh, he's already gone home.
2068000	2069000	Honestly, I'd be home too.
2071000	2072000	Hi.
2072000	2074000	Oh, less, less, less, up, up, up, down.
2074000	2076000	What was that last time?
2076000	2077000	Yeah, let's fuse.
2077000	2079000	What you got for me.
2081000	2083000	Stranny, I know you approve of dolls.
2083000	2086000	What if the doll is taller than the person normally is?
2089000	2091000	Has it all been done?
2091000	2092000	Oh.
2093000	2095000	Well, I guess we're going back to the graveyard.
2096000	2099000	A tall, skeletal doll?
2101000	2103000	Cheeky skeletal moment?
2103000	2104000	I don't know.
2108000	2109000	Oh, hello.
2109000	2110000	Hello.
2110000	2113000	Ah, so you moved the graveyard and now you can go outside.
2113000	2114000	I'll get lonely.
2114000	2115000	Can you come see me sometime?
2115000	2117000	I have plenty of Kinstones.
2117000	2119000	Oh, is this like infinite Kinstone person?
2121000	2123000	Like a Slenderman doll.
2123000	2126000	I don't think I could tolerate a Slenderman doll.
2126000	2127000	Oh.
2128000	2131000	Well, that's the source of the floor if I've ever seen one.
2133000	2134000	A waterfall.
2135000	2136000	Hello.
2137000	2138000	How many shells?
2138000	2139000	I think we might need to gamble.
2140000	2141000	Oh, we're 700.
2142000	2147000	Do you have any more to fuse together like you claimed young lady?
2148000	2149000	Oh, you do.
2149000	2152000	I wonder if she's just an infinite...
2155000	2156000	I'll come back.
2156000	2157000	I'll come back.
2157000	2158000	I need to cut the grass, okay?
2158000	2160000	The source of the floor is...
2162000	2163000	Wow.
2165000	2168000	I fucking got so nervous.
2168000	2170000	I was ready to pop at two minutes.
2170000	2174000	I got a little heated during the stream.
2174000	2177000	I was ready to pop after two minutes.
2177000	2179000	I was like, bro, I can't.
2179000	2180000	And then I got shy,
2180000	2182000	so I actually lasted the normal amount of time
2182000	2184000	and I was like, yeah, this one's like...
2186000	2188000	What's in here?
2188000	2189000	Hello.
2189000	2192000	Well, we definitely need to gamble now after that.
2200000	2205000	Yeah, I expected minutes just to be talking.
2205000	2206000	No.
2207000	2209000	Are we really doing gamble?
2209000	2210000	I don't know.
2211000	2212000	Gamble time.
2213000	2214000	Hello.
2215000	2216000	Traits.
2218000	2222000	The odds of us getting the same thing is diabolical.
2222000	2225000	If we end up with the same one figure percentage,
2225000	2229000	this just proves my gamble luck is just outrageously bad.
2230000	2231000	Aw, Zill and friends.
2231000	2233000	Zill is the one with the drippy nose.
2233000	2235000	He likes to wander around town with his pals.
2235000	2238000	He knows a lot about Hyrule and he might even give you some tips.
2238000	2239000	Aw.
2242000	2243000	I don't...
2243000	2246000	Right, we'll do this for like a whole four minutes, okay?
2247000	2248000	That's the best I got.
2248000	2253000	Four minutes in me and then we'll move on to the actual gameplay.
2254000	2256000	I think we have to go top right now
2256000	2263000	and then we unlock the last area and the last item.
2266000	2267000	Um...
2268000	2270000	Our probability is 97%.
2270000	2271000	How many...
2271000	2273000	Is there a hundred figurines on the door?
2275000	2276000	You...
2276000	2278000	Catch a game play.
2278000	2279000	Golden rule.
2279000	2281000	They call the snakes the rules.
2282000	2283000	I mean, I guess.
2283000	2284000	Okay.
2284000	2286000	Stunning hearing you finish...
2286000	2287000	Oh.
2288000	2289000	Great.
2289000	2290000	Now she's cool to live.
2290000	2291000	Aw, wait a minute.
2293000	2294000	I'm glad you...
2295000	2296000	Bond Liz.
2296000	2298000	Thank you for the mimbo.
2299000	2301000	There's a girl from my hero.
2301000	2302000	Your profile picture is bigger.
2302000	2304000	Let's take the girl from my hero.
2306000	2307000	I just forgot the name.
2307000	2308000	95%.
2308000	2309000	Right.
2309000	2310000	I'll stop.
2310000	2311000	Yeah, tell you what, I'll make a deal.
2311000	2313000	I'll stop once we get a duplicate.
2316000	2317000	A chaser.
2317000	2319000	Yeah, those things were chasing me.
2319000	2321000	They were getting my ankles, honestly.
2321000	2324000	We'll stop when we get a duplicate so we can be hero.
2324000	2325000	Hemiko.
2325000	2326000	Yeah.
2330000	2333000	There are 136 figurines total.
2333000	2334000	Okay.
2334000	2336000	So the probability is two.
2338000	2340000	Well, I guess that's our gamble time over.
2340000	2342000	Thank you everyone for playing at home.
2343000	2344000	I appreciate it.
2344000	2345000	I appreciate it.
2346000	2349000	Literally what the percentage is so high.
2349000	2352000	And it was one that we had literally just go up.
2352000	2354000	Oh wait, I can swim now.
2355000	2357000	Right, can I still not get this?
2360000	2362000	It doesn't look like...
2362000	2364000	I don't see a Minish entrance.
2364000	2367000	Oh, I need to jump with a freaking cape.
2367000	2369000	Right, okay, we're gonna go get a cape.
2371000	2375000	Right, no one wants to trade me.
2375000	2376000	That's fine.
2376000	2378000	We'll go get some switch for the reeflings
2378000	2381000	because I don't want you guys to be too hungry.
2381000	2384000	On our adventure, I'll get you your lovely cape.
2386000	2387000	Yes, thank you.
2389000	2390000	Nothing this time.
2390000	2391000	That's okay.
2391000	2393000	As long as the reefling got some food in this, come on.
2399000	2402000	I wonder what the mayor says now that we've been in his house.
2404000	2406000	I may look somewhat idle too, but no, sir.
2406000	2408000	I'll be working terrifically hard as soon as you leave.
2408000	2409000	You can bet that.
2409000	2412000	Oh, he's just like classic doesn't do anything.
2413000	2417000	Right, we now need to go top.
2417000	2419000	Right, let's speed things up a bit.
2421000	2422000	Get to work.
2424000	2425000	Oh, sorry.
2425000	2426000	Sorry, my bad.
2430000	2431000	Wait, is that a bump tree?
2432000	2434000	Oh, a cheeky bear.
2435000	2437000	Hey, I could actually use you right now
2437000	2439000	because I can't shoot my laser beam.
2439000	2440000	Thank you.
2443000	2444000	Basically every polish.
2444000	2445000	Hey, you can't say that.
2448000	2450000	Oh, we can swim.
2451000	2456000	Once we get the last item, we will do a full exploration.
2459000	2462000	Whoa, I can see that guy with a rock helmet over there.
2463000	2467000	Oh, I'm getting...
2467000	2469000	No, no bomba, no bomba.
2470000	2471000	Hello.
2472000	2474000	Oh, that's what the king gave us.
2475000	2477000	The two fit perfectly.
2478000	2480000	He has a cool hat as well.
2480000	2482000	What's your favorite item in this game?
2484000	2485000	A stone door.
2485000	2489000	So that's what they meant by the source of the flow business.
2489000	2493000	Well, this waterfall certainly is the source of Hyrule's water.
2493000	2494000	According to King Gustav,
2494000	2497000	the final element lies somewhere behind these falls.
2497000	2499000	We've done a long enough length.
2499000	2500000	Let's paint that element.
2502000	2504000	Maybe my favorite item is the light
2504000	2506000	so I can fucking see in this cave.
2509000	2510000	Oh, I'm missing.
2510000	2511000	I'm missing.
2511000	2512000	The bat's just so skinny.
2512000	2513000	Right, whoops.
2514000	2515000	In both.
2516000	2517000	Um...
2519000	2520000	Oh god, what's that doing?
2522000	2523000	Oh, you can't destroy it.
2524000	2526000	I'm on fire and I can't do anything.
2535000	2538000	I guess it makes you vulnerable.
2542000	2543000	Oh, no more bomba.
2544000	2545000	No more bombs.
2545000	2546000	I can't take any more bombs.
2546000	2547000	Give me my gambaba.
2551000	2553000	Oh my god, why is he so aggressive?
2553000	2555000	Get me up this wall.
2555000	2557000	Oh no, they're going to chase me up the wall.
2557000	2558000	No, leave me alone.
2558000	2559000	Leave me alone.
2559000	2560000	I'm just a per innocent boy.
2560000	2562000	I have no family.
2562000	2563000	Spare my life.
2564000	2566000	Hey, we found another wind crest.
2566000	2567000	Absolutely, right.
2567000	2568000	Let me think about that.
2568000	2569000	Stop!
2569000	2570000	Oh my god, just a minute.
2570000	2571000	Get me in this cave right now.
2571000	2573000	It's even worse than the cave.
2578000	2580000	Oh, that didn't even hurt him.
2581000	2582000	What's there here?
2584000	2585000	Okay, just...
2585000	2586000	I swear if it shells.
2588000	2590000	Bro, we've got enough shells.
2590000	2591000	I don't want a gambaba though.
2591000	2592000	I don't want to send gambaba.
2592000	2593000	Oh, gambaba at the end.
2596000	2597000	Up or down, up or down.
2597000	2598000	I'm going up.
2598000	2599000	I'm going up.
2600000	2601000	I'm going up stairs.
2601000	2602000	I'm going to enter.
2603000	2606000	Jeez, the bat and fire station caverns.
2607000	2609000	Think of the tourism industry.
2610000	2611000	Okay, I'll take you.
2613000	2614000	What?
2614000	2615000	What?
2615000	2616000	I need out.
2616000	2617000	I need out.
2617000	2618000	Jeez, let me.
2618000	2619000	The race.
2622000	2623000	Wait.
2626000	2628000	I've just done a 360.
2629000	2630000	No.
2630000	2631000	Right.
2632000	2633000	Yeah, I was going to say,
2633000	2634000	there's clearly something in the war
2634000	2635000	if it's giving me a ledge.
2636000	2638000	Some of those are ropes though.
2638000	2639000	I'm not even interacting with that.
2640000	2641000	Anything in here?
2641000	2642000	Whoa, red.
2648000	2650000	Oh, yes, I've unlocked it.
2650000	2652000	Have a gun.
2652000	2653000	It was like, what?
2657000	2658000	Oh, I'm rubbish at this game.
2659000	2661000	Shawnee's going to turn into a hoarder
2661000	2662000	of pyramid crafts all of a sudden.
2662000	2664000	Literally, there's so many shells.
2664000	2666000	So this wasn't the way I was supposed to go.
2667000	2668000	What is?
2670000	2671000	I think I've done wrong then.
2677000	2678000	What?
2681000	2682000	Oh, there's a door there.
2683000	2684000	That I didn't take.
2685000	2686000	There is a fitting fitting.
2686000	2687000	Okay, there we go.
2687000	2688000	There we go.
2688000	2689000	Did it?
2689000	2690000	Sorry, excuse me.
2690000	2691000	Pardon me, coming through.
2700000	2701000	What have we here?
2701000	2703000	Some kind of vortex?
2703000	2706000	Well, we seem to have hit a dead end.
2706000	2707000	What shall we do from here?
2708000	2709000	Go in the vortex.
2714000	2715000	Close talk.
2715000	2716000	Close talk.
2718000	2719000	Am I still alive?
2720000	2722000	Link, what were you thinking, child?
2722000	2725000	You just reaped the world winds, as they say.
2726000	2728000	We could be dead right now.
2728000	2730000	I must admit, it did the trick.
2730000	2731000	Are we?
2731000	2732000	Are we?
2733000	2735000	In the lands above the clouds?
2736000	2738000	Then there must be something here
2738000	2740000	that can lead us to the fire element.
2740000	2741000	Let's go find it.
2742000	2743000	Ah, you surprised me.
2743000	2745000	Normally, surface dwellers can't walk on the clouds
2745000	2746000	like we do.
2746000	2748000	My sister and I went to the Depokori Festival
2748000	2749000	on Hyrule Town,
2749000	2750000	and when we came back,
2750000	2751000	there were monsters everywhere.
2751000	2754000	I bet if I could just fuse a Kinstone,
2755000	2757000	but there are monsters about even...
2758000	2760000	Do you think you could search for the Kinstone people?
2761000	2762000	Oh, do you need like...
2762000	2763000	Oh, no, we can do it.
2766000	2767000	Fly, Strony, fly!
2768000	2770000	My favorite dungeon.
2770000	2772000	Are you late this year?
2772000	2774000	I think the air tops are maybe...
2775000	2776000	Really?
2777000	2780000	I know the reward is like...
2780000	2781000	getting...
2781000	2782000	Uh, yeah, we li-
2783000	2785000	Did I not skip the clouds?
2788000	2789000	Oh, hello.
2792000	2793000	Okay, but I don't have what you need.
2793000	2794000	What about you?
2794000	2795000	Oh, this is bad, really bad.
2795000	2796000	Oh, hey, look at that.
2796000	2797000	I've never seen a surface dweller on the clouds.
2797000	2798000	You must be pure of heart.
2798000	2801000	Maybe one such as you would listen to the tale of my woe.
2801000	2802000	See?
2802000	2803000	Right, I'm...
2803000	2805000	I just heard it from your sister.
2805000	2806000	Thank you.
2806000	2807000	That sounded really rude.
2807000	2808000	Oh, no, no, no, no.
2808000	2809000	I do have it.
2809000	2810000	Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.
2811000	2812000	The controls are...
2812000	2814000	Slightly different position.
2814000	2815000	Ooh, where did we unlock?
2815000	2816000	Cause it's red.
2817000	2819000	Ooh, is it gonna be a coup?
2819000	2821000	Oh, we were just there!
2822000	2823000	I was just there!
2825000	2826000	Rude.
2826000	2827000	Honestly.
2829000	2830000	Okay.
2831000	2834000	Uh, let's go a little further right?
2834000	2835000	Cause I can...
2835000	2836000	Or no.
2839000	2840000	What am I the bad dude?
2840000	2841000	Heh heh heh.
2842000	2843000	What's down here?
2843000	2844000	Wow!
2846000	2847000	We are short.
2857000	2859000	I like how we get to dig the clouds.
2859000	2860000	That's so cool.
2862000	2863000	Oh!
2864000	2865000	Wait!
2865000	2867000	We can get Kenstone pieces in here?
2867000	2869000	Or was that, like, actually there?
2871000	2873000	I think that may have actually been sitting there.
2874000	2875000	Okay.
2876000	2877000	Uh, let's fold down.
2877000	2879000	Cause we've not been in them here.
2880000	2881000	Wow!
2881000	2882000	Hello!
2882000	2884000	Did I have your missing piece?
2884000	2885000	I did!
2887000	2888000	All yours, buddy.
2888000	2890000	Mysterious cloud.
2892000	2893000	Uh...
2896000	2898000	A couple more to go, I guess?
2901000	2903000	That's probably more shells, honestly.
2904000	2906000	Uh, we take a little left here.
2906000	2907000	A little cheeky left.
2910000	2912000	Uh, what is over here?
2912000	2914000	Is there anything of interest?
2914000	2915000	No.
2915000	2917000	Let's jump down first to make sure we have,
2917000	2918000	adequately,
2918000	2920000	the woman trouble.
2922000	2925000	Oh god, they're going to knock me off the map.
2925000	2926000	Okay.
2926000	2927000	Two hit.
2927000	2928000	Oh, he just...
2929000	2930000	Oh, we got a...
2930000	2931000	Okay, okay, okay.
2931000	2932000	Second piece, second piece.
2932000	2934000	Yeah, let me get up, let me get up.
2934000	2935000	Thank you.
2936000	2937000	Skyfish.
2937000	2938000	Skyshark.
2938000	2939000	Honestly.
2940000	2941000	Skiyark.
2942000	2943000	Great.
2943000	2944000	What is this down here?
2944000	2945000	A little to the left.
2945000	2946000	A little to the left.
2947000	2949000	Let's grab that wind gust.
2949000	2950000	Don't want to get in trouble.
2951000	2952000	Let me get up.
2952000	2953000	Let me get up.
2954000	2956000	Uh, oh, there was something up there.
2956000	2957000	Hmm.
2958000	2959000	Can I do it?
2960000	2961000	Whoa, where are you?
2961000	2963000	Did I need a shield from him?
2966000	2967000	Well, luckily...
2967000	2968000	Okay.
2968000	2969000	I'm sorry.
2969000	2970000	What was that supposed to do?
2970000	2971000	A bow and arrow?
2971000	2972000	I think a bow and arrow.
2978000	2979000	Oh, suck him up.
2979000	2981000	Because he's an arrow thing.
2982000	2984000	Gimme your cloud right now.
2984000	2985000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2985000	2988000	You're not so big without your cloud now, are you?
2989000	2990000	Mario's gonna...
2992000	2993000	Oh, sugar.
2993000	2996000	Right, we need to come back to this one.
2996000	2998000	Because we don't have the correct piece.
2998000	3001000	Surely, I will not forget the location.
3002000	3003000	Surely.
3003000	3004000	Hope you'll...
3005000	3008000	Okay, uh, middle left is...
3009000	3011000	Uh, tree...
3014000	3015000	Middle left.
3020000	3021000	What?
3021000	3022000	What?
3022000	3023000	What?
3023000	3026000	No, chicken shells, but I'm so full.
3029000	3030000	Jar of boomerang will not...
3030000	3031000	What?
3033000	3035000	That is my favorite mermaid waifu?
3035000	3037000	I ain't even a mermaid.
3037000	3038000	Oh, good thing.
3040000	3041000	Ah.
3042000	3044000	Oh, there's another one of those guys.
3044000	3045000	Wait, you perish.
3047000	3049000	Yeah, we're getting there with the minish.
3049000	3050000	We're on the last element,
3050000	3053000	and then I think everything goes to do the time.
3054000	3055000	Yeah, yeah.
3055000	3056000	Perish.
3056000	3057000	Oh.
3057000	3058000	Okay.
3058000	3059000	Is this it?
3062000	3064000	Okay, we now know...
3064000	3068000	it's middle left for whatever one is missing.
3069000	3071000	Oh, there's five?
3071000	3072000	Oh, them...
3075000	3077000	I don't know what one to do then.
3080000	3083000	Oh, well, I don't mind if I do.
3083000	3084000	Oh.
3085000	3088000	Am I gonna have to do a second lap?
3091000	3093000	I feel like I'm gonna have to do a second lap
3093000	3095000	around this area.
3096000	3097000	I don't know.
3100000	3102000	I can't remember your style.
3102000	3103000	As soon as you said mermaid,
3103000	3104000	and I'm like,
3104000	3105000	I'm not a mermaid.
3105000	3106000	And I'm like,
3106000	3107000	oh, wait a minute.
3107000	3108000	I was like,
3108000	3109000	oh, wait, hold on a minute.
3109000	3110000	Hold on a minute.
3110000	3112000	I didn't write that part of my line.
3115000	3117000	Oh, I got two licks in.
3117000	3118000	I'm the most.
3119000	3120000	One each.
3122000	3124000	You know, for an enemy,
3124000	3127000	you sure as heck don't actually directly attack.
3130000	3133000	I'm gonna get shoved off the map because of that.
3134000	3136000	Oh, I need to defeat him.
3138000	3139000	No, I'm...
3139000	3141000	Okay, I need like an eight-foot sword,
3141000	3143000	like an Elden Ring.
3145000	3148000	Or just do that and knock yourself out.
3148000	3151000	Aren't sirens the evil mermaids?
3151000	3153000	I mean, I guess.
3153000	3156000	I guess you're lucky that I don't have to sing,
3156000	3159000	or you'd be in such deep doo-doo.
3160000	3162000	You're not in deep doo-doo.
3163000	3164000	Right, enough with the shells.
3164000	3166000	We ain't go all the time at Gambo.
3170000	3171000	Sure, drop this here.
3171000	3173000	I won't say there's something here.
3180000	3181000	Just get me up.
3184000	3185000	Freaking go.
3185000	3187000	There's a cheeky hole.
3189000	3190000	What's up there?
3190000	3191000	I don't know.
3191000	3192000	What's down here?
3193000	3195000	Oh, a fusion.
3195000	3196000	I'll take it.
3196000	3197000	I'll take it.
3197000	3198000	You fit.
3199000	3200000	Perfect.
3202000	3203000	I calculated.
3203000	3204000	Calculate.
3204000	3205000	Yes, yes, calculate.
3205000	3206000	True, true, emoji gamer.
3206000	3207000	Okay, two more.
3207000	3209000	I have one golden piece.
3209000	3211000	I just need the other one.
3211000	3214000	I can go back to the middle one that I missed.
3223000	3225000	Wow, we can't get up there.
3226000	3228000	But we can get radio.
3231000	3234000	There's not like a secret on the wall or anything.
3237000	3238000	Where are we going?
3238000	3239000	Where are we going?
3239000	3240000	Come on.
3244000	3247000	Okay, we're now back on the other one.
3248000	3251000	I need to go top left to get the last piece.
3251000	3253000	Which I'm going to do right now.
3253000	3254000	Top left.
3254000	3255000	Yes.
3255000	3257000	Baby, last piece.
3257000	3258000	Oh my God.
3258000	3260000	I'm so smart.
3264000	3265000	Oh, there's something here.
3266000	3269000	Hey, don't give me.
3269000	3271000	You know what?
3272000	3273000	Okay.
3273000	3274000	Okay.
3274000	3275000	I should have gambled.
3275000	3276000	I admit it.
3276000	3278000	I should have kept gambling.
3278000	3280000	I apologize.
3280000	3282000	I should have kept gambling.
3282000	3283000	Okay.
3283000	3284000	I think it was in here.
3286000	3288000	Literally the game's like, please gamble.
3288000	3290000	I'm like, I'm child.
3291000	3292000	I shouldn't be doing it.
3292000	3293000	Right.
3293000	3294000	Did we?
3296000	3298000	I think it's back at the start.
3300000	3301000	And the other one.
3302000	3304000	There's a back at the start.
3304000	3305000	Question mark.
3305000	3306000	I don't know.
3309000	3311000	Serves you right for not gambling.
3311000	3315000	Did you know that 100% of people that win big give up,
3315000	3317000	like right before,
3317000	3319000	I can't remember what the meme format is,
3319000	3320000	but yeah, it's awful.
3321000	3323000	Please don't actually gamble.
3327000	3329000	I'm actually getting a bit turned around now.
3329000	3331000	I'm like 99%.
3332000	3335000	I already did this one today.
3337000	3338000	So what's up here?
3341000	3342000	Okay.
3342000	3343000	I grabbed that one.
3343000	3345000	What was back down here?
3346000	3351000	I can't remember.
3351000	3354000	90% of gambling addicts quit before they hit big.
3354000	3356000	Yeah, literally that's so terrible.
3356000	3359000	That meme format is absolutely a reader.
3362000	3364000	I'd actually be really interested in doing a deep dive
3364000	3366000	into the gamble psychology
3366000	3371000	because I struggle to comprehend it
3371000	3373000	because I just get really...
3375000	3376000	Right.
3376000	3378000	Am I going the wrong way again?
3378000	3380000	I think I might have.
3380000	3382000	Oh, I got red.
3382000	3384000	Okay, it is just random.
3385000	3386000	I'm running in circles.
3386000	3388000	I know I'm trying to get back to the start.
3388000	3391000	I don't know where the last podium is.
3392000	3394000	Any podium goers?
3394000	3396000	I think it's back at the start.
3396000	3399000	I think I just can go back now because I've got the piece.
3399000	3401000	Unless it was back there.
3401000	3402000	Wait, hold on.
3402000	3403000	Let me do a U-turn.
3407000	3410000	I'm too busy yapping.
3410000	3411000	No, we did do it.
3411000	3413000	Right, go back up again.
3413000	3415000	Yeah, the last one's back at the start.
3415000	3416000	Okay, okay, okay.
3417000	3419000	No, no, Link, no.
3419000	3423000	I'm starting to think you just like the gravity of falling.
3425000	3427000	You can't go back to the start from here.
3429000	3431000	Always gambit till you're broke.
3431000	3433000	No, this is terrible.
3438000	3440000	I think it's to the right there.
3441000	3446000	Right, I just need to take our U-turn right and then we found it.
3453000	3455000	This, this is it.
3455000	3456000	Surely.
3457000	3458000	Sure is it.
3462000	3463000	Oh, there it is.
3463000	3465000	I just need a drop down.
3466000	3467000	Wow.
3468000	3470000	Whoever said go right, time them out.
3470000	3471000	No one said that.
3471000	3473000	You don't have to say that anymore.
3473000	3475000	Oh, we did it, we did it, we did it.
3475000	3477000	Get me the heck out here.
3480000	3482000	Why gamble when you can give your money a mummy?
3482000	3484000	No, well, you don't need to do that either.
3485000	3490000	What's more of a ways gamble or giving me money?
3490000	3493000	Choose your, choose your challenger.
3494000	3496000	We did it, yeah.
3500000	3504000	Fantastico, fantastico, let's go.
3504000	3507000	And we got two redkenstone pieces of all that.
3507000	3510000	Oh my god, look how pretty it is.
3510000	3512000	Oh, and we can get a freaking flight stolen.
3512000	3513000	Thank goodness.
3513000	3515000	Hey, we found another wincrease.
3515000	3518000	Now we have one more to travel to when we use the ocarina.
3518000	3520000	Hey, ocarina.
3522000	3525000	Now, how do you build something like this on top of a clown?
3525000	3527000	Maybe someone lives inside.
3527000	3529000	If so, perhaps you could ask for the element.
3529000	3532000	I'm just checking if there's a hidden secret on the outside, but no.
3533000	3534000	It's kinda...
3535000	3537000	Okay, now the man's out of my way.
3537000	3538000	Do you remember that portal?
3538000	3540000	Do you remember that portal?
3540000	3545000	Oh, if it's an old link, my quest to match kinstones has taken me all the way up here.
3545000	3547000	I'm not sure you've noticed yet, but we're on top of the clouds.
3547000	3549000	The wind trebles here.
3549000	3553000	They protect the path of the palace of winds where the wind element lies.
3554000	3555000	Oh, it's you.
3555000	3558000	I thought I'd never make it back here, but thanks to your kinstone, I did.
3558000	3562000	If you're looking for something, go talk to the elderly lady on the fourth floor.
3562000	3564000	Okay, elderly lady, fourth floor.
3564000	3566000	Blue flower, white thorns.
3566000	3568000	There's something like that, I can't remember.
3571000	3573000	Oh yeah, give me your pot.
3574000	3576000	Look, there's the old man.
3576000	3578000	He's up in there, and there's something.
3578000	3579000	Oh, it's Link.
3579000	3580000	Thank you for your help over there.
3580000	3581000	I've got something else here.
3581000	3582000	Take this.
3588000	3589000	Huh?
3591000	3593000	Did you double damage?
3595000	3597000	Did you double damage?
3597000	3599000	Imagine if I let that gentleman slip away.
3599000	3601000	Why is everyone asking for the pieces I don't have?
3601000	3602000	You know, feel well.
3602000	3604000	I don't have that piece.
3604000	3606000	He just upgraded my bowl.
3610000	3611000	Hello?
3611000	3612000	Let me guess.
3612000	3613000	You're going to ask for a piece I don't have?
3613000	3616000	Oh, you asked for the piece I actually do know.
3618000	3620000	Hold the button.
3622000	3623000	A snake.
3624000	3625000	Yeah, yeah.
3625000	3627000	It's all coming in my way.
3628000	3629000	Well done.
3629000	3631000	Hey, they set perfectly.
3631000	3633000	The wind tribe is very skilled at pieces.
3633000	3634000	So skilled in fact.
3634000	3636000	We have more of them than we can manage.
3636000	3637000	We can't even store them.
3637000	3639000	I wish someone would take them.
3642000	3644000	You wish someone would take them?
3644000	3645000	Say no more.
3645000	3648000	No, I'm not doing anything in here at all.
3649000	3650000	Yeah, oh, thanks.
3650000	3651000	She's slow.
3651000	3652000	I'll take that.
3652000	3653000	Don't mind if I do.
3653000	3654000	Thanks, hen.
3654000	3655000	I appreciate it.
3656000	3658000	Yeah, your collection's a whale.
3663000	3664000	Oh, what's that?
3664000	3667000	You need someone to take away all your pieces?
3667000	3668000	Oh, you shouldn't.
3668000	3669000	Yeah, you shouldn't.
3669000	3670000	What's going on?
3671000	3672000	Welcome, welcome.
3672000	3675000	Long, long ago and then the age before that.
3675000	3680000	I tried the brand and the place you call the wind ruins.
3681000	3682000	With our magic,
3682000	3685000	we moved our palace up into the skies.
3685000	3687000	We are the wind tribe.
3687000	3690000	We've been watching and we know all that is happening
3690000	3692000	on your surface world.
3692000	3695000	We know a small boy collects elements
3695000	3698000	to lift the curse for a princess.
3698000	3701000	We know of Vati and his evil acts.
3701000	3703000	The winds tell us these things.
3703000	3707000	The wind element that you seek lies deep
3707000	3710000	in the palace of winds above me.
3710000	3715000	When the blade has been infused with four elements,
3715000	3717000	sorry, forgetting my lines here,
3717000	3721000	the way to the light force shall open.
3721000	3725000	So it is told in the legend of the wind tribe.
3725000	3729000	Vati himself may already know this.
3729000	3731000	Surfaced well as they're not permitted
3731000	3733000	to enter our palace,
3733000	3736000	but you, boy, are special.
3737000	3740000	You may continue to the roof.
3741000	3743000	Can I fuse with you?
3744000	3747000	You're a cheeky granny, you are.
3747000	3749000	You're cheeky cheeky granny.
3749000	3751000	You got me a weekend stone to fuse.
3751000	3753000	There's this device in the palace
3753000	3755000	that allows you to fly in the sky.
3755000	3756000	When I get bigger,
3756000	3757000	I want to explore the palace and find it,
3757000	3759000	but I'm too scared right now.
3760000	3762000	You just walked over me.
3762000	3763000	That's rude.
3764000	3766000	And before someone complains
3766000	3768000	about being weighed down by Cherries.
3768000	3770000	Cherries for me to take.
3773000	3774000	Right here.
3774000	3775000	Oh, baby!
3775000	3777000	Okay, full health.
3777000	3778000	Ready?
3779000	3780000	Ready?
3782000	3783000	We're going to do this
3783000	3784000	and I'll make a tea,
3784000	3786000	and then we'll do lots of exploring
3786000	3788000	to see if we can get all the hearts and stuff.
3788000	3790000	One, irritation.
3790000	3792000	We find our way to the very tops of the cloud,
3792000	3794000	and then we have to go even higher
3794000	3796000	to find a floating palace.
3796000	3798000	I can't believe what a long way we've come.
3798000	3800000	And look how high we are.
3800000	3801000	Don't look down, blink,
3801000	3803000	and watch your step.
3803000	3805000	It's a long fall from here, ya bam.
3806000	3808000	Look, I'm trying my best, jeez.
3808000	3809000	Don't need to...
3809000	3810000	Oh, I'm gonna need them.
3811000	3812000	I'm gonna need to...
3812000	3814000	There's so many enemies on this map.
3815000	3816000	Oh.
3816000	3817000	Oh, it made them fall.
3817000	3818000	Oh, that's not very nice.
3818000	3819000	Where'd they go?
3822000	3824000	Can I stop coming?
3825000	3826000	No!
3826000	3827000	I didn't know you could do that!
3827000	3829000	But the scallies...
3833000	3834000	I just got pranked.
3835000	3836000	And 4k.
3837000	3838000	Alright, hold on.
3838000	3839000	We need to do the boomerang.
3841000	3843000	So we need to do the boomerang?
3845000	3846000	Is that it?
3850000	3851000	Am I going crazy?
3851000	3852000	What do I need?
3852000	3853000	A bow and arrow?
3853000	3855000	Am I like, banned arrows now?
3859000	3860000	Okay, okay.
3860000	3861000	Arrows, arrows.
3861000	3862000	It's fine, it's fine.
3862000	3864000	Guys, why are you sweating?
3865000	3866000	I was going,
3866000	3868000	hmm, I missed the logic in this puzzle.
3868000	3869000	Oh, whoa.
3869000	3870000	I almost fell off the map
3870000	3872000	because I wasn't paying attention.
3873000	3874000	Eeps.
3874000	3875000	Eeps.
3876000	3878000	Okay, let's do a bow and arrow.
3879000	3882000	I need to go by with 3?
3883000	3884000	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
3896000	3898000	Why would you give me stones?
3898000	3900000	I can push, I have no idea.
3901000	3902000	Wow.
3906000	3907000	Music game, good.
3908000	3909000	Wow, please don't hurt me.
3910000	3911000	Please don't hurt me.
3914000	3915000	Whoa.
3916000	3918000	Okay, I've actually got a fright there.
3918000	3920000	I'm like, I just jumped in my chair.
3921000	3922000	Like, I knew it was going to happen,
3922000	3924000	but I still got a fright nonetheless.
3924000	3925000	What is going on?
3926000	3927000	Whoa.
3928000	3929000	What am I to go?
3930000	3931000	I can't do that.
3931000	3932000	Whoa, whoa.
3932000	3934000	Where's the fire going?
3935000	3937000	Oh my God, I'm so skinny.
3937000	3938000	I'm actually so skinny,
3938000	3940000	I didn't get hit once, Lamal.
3940000	3942000	There's a fluffy cloudflown here.
3942000	3944000	It looks awfully comfortable.
3944000	3946000	I too would like to sleep on a cloud.
3948000	3949000	Should I?
3949000	3950000	I'm going to use the boomerang.
3950000	3951000	Oh.
3952000	3954000	Because it doesn't cost any ammo.
3955000	3956000	I jumped too.
3956000	3958000	Literally, give me a wee fray.
3958000	3959000	Oh, I'm supposed to be here.
3961000	3964000	Ew, what happens if I sat on it?
3969000	3971000	Oh, I'm actually...
3981000	3983000	Logic puzzle or I'm just...
3986000	3987000	Am I going the wrong way?
3988000	3989000	Okay.
3995000	3996000	Use a bomb.
3998000	4000000	I'm about to blow this.
4001000	4003000	I would not have figured that out.
4003000	4004000	I'm going to be honest.
4004000	4005000	Oh, yum.
4006000	4007000	Ah.
4010000	4012000	Shadow Wizard money game.
4012000	4014000	We look at these spills.
4016000	4017000	Well, I lost that fight anyway.
4019000	4020000	Oh.
4024000	4025000	I wondered that.
4025000	4027000	We unlocked the figurines
4027000	4030000	before we actually went against them.
4031000	4033000	Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.
4033000	4034000	This is the shit.
4034000	4035000	This is the shit.
4037000	4039000	Shadow Wizard money game.
4044000	4045000	Oh, I'll get wrecked.
4045000	4046000	Oh, I'll get wrecked.
4046000	4056000	Oh, bless I am. You've got Rockscape. Great. Jump with the greatness of Ease. Hold the button and jump faster.
4056000	4064000	Right. Oh my god. Oh, I'm so good. I'm actually so good.
4064000	4070000	This game. Well, we can officially fully explore the map now. We'll do.
4070000	4078000	Gamma. I saw that.
4078000	4084000	I'm actually so good. You have this figure. You must be a fan of the family.
4084000	4091000	Oh my god. I love being able to jump.
4091000	4099000	Okay.
4099000	4103000	I just can't roll up them.
4103000	4107000	I cast and bear her growth.
4107000	4111000	I'm still in mulch. I'm still addicted to mulch.
4111000	4115000	Whoa. Game shields up.
4115000	4127000	I can't.
4127000	4139000	There's a strong gale blowing here. Try not to get swept away and hold on to your hat. You're my hat.
4139000	4143000	Am I supposed to get blown away? I think I'm supposed to jump.
4143000	4147000	I am supposed to jump. Whoa.
4147000	4155000	I was almost gone there. I'm not going to lie. We almost didn't make that jump there.
4155000	4159000	Oh.
4159000	4167000	What? Okay. We need to do the magic staff thing.
4167000	4173000	Okay. Okay. We're getting there. We're getting there.
4173000	4179000	Zelda. Let's go. That panel. I think if we stomped on it hard enough, it might flip over.
4179000	4185000	Yeah. We're still missing two bottles. No. I ain't doing it.
4185000	4189000	The money's good, but I ain't doing it.
4189000	4197000	I ain't missing it.
4197000	4201000	I don't actually remember how difficult the boss is up ahead.
4201000	4205000	There is a possibility we have to go...
4205000	4211000	We have to go back. We have to go deeper.
4211000	4223000	Because we are missing out on a lot of exploratory goodies.
4223000	4227000	Oh my... Bruh, who's...
4227000	4231000	How skinny you can come?
4231000	4239000	Ah, can I do it in time? No, by a freaking bore here.
4239000	4243000	No, Gami. Stop it. Gami, that's mean.
4243000	4247000	Okay. It looks like I need to jump between two.
4247000	4251000	Yes. After this area, we'll do exploring.
4251000	4255000	We'll try and get full hearts. We'll go back to all those master tutor people as well.
4255000	4259000	Professional speedrunner confirmed, actually, though.
4259000	4265000	Witch dungeon. This is for the fourth element, the wind element. We're in the sky temple.
4265000	4269000	I might want to activate my boots first.
4269000	4273000	Oh, I don't like this. I don't like this.
4273000	4277000	I'm just going to take the HP damage because...
4277000	4281000	Yeah, I don't want to have to do this.
4281000	4285000	Oh, and the fucking boots respawned.
4285000	4291000	Well, I'm not mad with Spain.
4291000	4295000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and the respawn.
4295000	4299000	One thing I could absolutely decimate about this game.
4299000	4303000	Okay, and then straight down.
4303000	4307000	Jeez, get me over there.
4307000	4319000	I tried to put up my uno collab.
4319000	4323000	Schedule, and it kept rejecting it for some reason.
4323000	4327000	I think me, Mercy, and me are just too powerful.
4327000	4331000	I kept saying error when I put it up.
4331000	4335000	Sorry about the uno collab not being up, but there is an uno collab.
4335000	4339000	Oh, as far as I'm aware, there's an uno collab.
4339000	4343000	Silly me. Silly me. I'm being a silly sausage.
4343000	4347000	But I'll try and get it up.
4347000	4351000	Why did you do that?
4351000	4355000	I'll try and get it up after the stream.
4355000	4359000	Oh, killing me.
4359000	4363000	Tiny time. Tiny time.
4363000	4367000	Tiny time.
4367000	4371000	Oh, no. Oh, no, this can't be.
4371000	4375000	Is this a logic puzzle? Well, I can only push it.
4375000	4379000	Oh, shit.
4383000	4387000	Like this.
4387000	4391000	Oh, that's a star.
4391000	4395000	A bluntly half as well.
4395000	4399000	I'm making it worse.
4399000	4403000	I'm making it worse.
4403000	4407000	I'm making it worse.
4407000	4411000	I'm making it worse.
4411000	4415000	Oh, no way I did it.
4415000	4419000	Oh, no way I did it.
4419000	4423000	Oh, my God. I don't know how I did that.
4423000	4427000	I'll take it.
4427000	4431000	I think this dungeon
4431000	4435000	is actually pretty big.
4435000	4439000	Can't believe you let me cook.
4439000	4443000	Can I jump over this?
4443000	4447000	Can I jump over this?
4447000	4451000	No.
4451000	4455000	Oh.
4455000	4459000	I never see it until it's really obvious.
4459000	4463000	I got it lucky.
4463000	4467000	Wait, no.
4467000	4471000	Did not already have access to this area?
4471000	4475000	Did not already have access to this area?
4475000	4479000	I'm losing it.
4479000	4483000	But I just did that.
4483000	4487000	Oh, I have a key to get here.
4487000	4491000	Yeah. When Twilight Princess, I've never played another Zelda game.
4491000	4495000	This is the issue. The only reason I'm doing malely good on this one
4495000	4499000	is because I actually played it before.
4499000	4503000	But focusing, there's another...
4503000	4507000	a new 2D Zelda out which I'm actually super interested in.
4507000	4511000	I need to watch the trailer.
4511000	4515000	But I think we might be playing Baltoi.
4515000	4519000	Baltoi? Baltoi.
4519000	4523000	Baltoi next week.
4523000	4527000	That's lovely, the piece that I've been needing.
4527000	4531000	I need to do what now?
4531000	4535000	Okay, I just send it.
4535000	4539000	What?
4539000	4543000	Thank you, Imperial Monarch. You're work right now?
4543000	4547000	Oh, I'm doing lawn work. Oh my god.
4547000	4551000	Someone commented under the video, like the audio.
4551000	4555000	You should... oh, I'm at work right now.
4555000	4559000	So I can't listen. And I always so tend to send back.
4559000	4563000	No, do it. Get hard at work.
4563000	4567000	I can't be doing this. People are getting fucking trouble for this shit, honestly.
4567000	4571000	But I was feeling it yesterday.
4571000	4575000	You guys were letting me talk about whatever my interests are in that.
4575000	4579000	So my brain was like, yeah, let's get rid of this.
4579000	4583000	How did I hurt myself in
4583000	4587000	trying to hurt the enemy?
4587000	4591000	Please get us in trouble. No, like, literally, I was like, no, this is...
4591000	4595000	I had to hold myself back. I don't know if you guys do this,
4595000	4599000	but I type out responses on Twitter and stuff, and then I delete it
4599000	4603000	because I'm like, no, you idiot. That's not a good idea.
4603000	4607000	Don't do that. That's so bad of me.
4607000	4611000	Hey, it is from...
4611000	4615000	Can I even get him? Yeah, I was going to say, can I even get him
4615000	4619000	without perishing? One way or another, he's going to get me.
4619000	4623000	It wouldn't mind some hearts. I'm starting to get a bit low.
4623000	4627000	Finally finished working, mummy. Thank you for the... yeah!
4627000	4631000	You're welcome!
4631000	4635000	Less than 3,000. Thank you so much.
4635000	4639000	Broly legend, thank you. Sorry.
4639000	4643000	I'm struggling. Just, just, just...
4643000	4647000	I'm struggling to read. I can't believe it. I can't believe my inability to read
4647000	4651000	is coming back to me. Oh, there's a heart! There's a heart! There's a heart!
4651000	4655000	Wait, this is not where I'm supposed to go?
4655000	4659000	Where am I supposed to go?
4659000	4663000	Oh, I can just go for it.
4663000	4667000	Because I have flight now. Can I jump for this one?
4667000	4671000	No, you cannot! Please, if you ever thought that you could
4671000	4675000	perhaps jump for that one, please don't jump for that one.
4675000	4679000	Don't be like me and think you can make it. You cannot make that jump.
4679000	4683000	Eh...
4683000	4687000	That's what office toilets are for.
4687000	4691000	That's terrible!
4691000	4695000	Right into... right in his arms. All of my guests, you're one too.
4695000	4699000	Please, game you... this game...
4699000	4703000	What the fuck is that?
4703000	4707000	Armor? Okay.
4707000	4711000	I need to buy a large quiver right now.
4711000	4715000	Because if... ow!
4715000	4719000	Bro, this game needs to start dropping hearts. Please do not make me go all the way back to the start. I'll cry.
4719000	4723000	Bruh.
4727000	4731000	I need focus. I actually need to focus! What's going on?
4731000	4735000	I need to focus.
4735000	4739000	Yeah, yeah, get fucked.
4739000	4743000	What is going on?
4743000	4747000	How much freaking arrow I put in you?
4747000	4751000	Oh, I'm actually gonna die. What happens if you die in Legend of Zelda?
4751000	4755000	Oh my god, the teleport's right there, I think.
4755000	4759000	This is the first teleport.
4759000	4763000	Okay.
4763000	4767000	Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let me get up, let me get up.
4767000	4771000	Oh! What the...
4771000	4775000	Wait, so I put a billion arrows? No, this isn't the teleport out!
4775000	4779000	Sugar, I thought this was the teleport here.
4779000	4783000	I am so low, but I don't want to go all the way back.
4783000	4787000	Holy crap, I just need to not mess it up. Don't mess...
4787000	4791000	Don't mess it up, it's fine. Don't mess it up though. Don't mess it up!
4791000	4795000	Can someone drop me a heart? Like, seriously?
4795000	4799000	No, I couldn't have done that worse if I tried!
4799000	4803000	If I tried, if I tried. If I tried.
4803000	4807000	Literally, the game has put me on life support.
4807000	4811000	Oh, am I actually gonna die? I really don't want to go back though!
4811000	4815000	Oh, please have a heart in this.
4815000	4819000	Can I keep leaving the room and then coming back?
4819000	4823000	Oh wait, I need a pot, sorry.
4823000	4827000	Hold on, is this gonna drop a heart if I do this?
4827000	4831000	It's dropping rupees, so if it's respawn and there's a chance it'll give me a heart.
4831000	4835000	Hold on, hold on!
4835000	4839000	Bear with me, bear with me, Aces in the room, bear with me.
4839000	4843000	Oh, come on!
4843000	4847000	Give us a chance for a heart! Why is this game so
4847000	4851000	allergic to dropping hearts from pots?
4851000	4855000	Literally, I'm just getting my bank account up right now.
4855000	4859000	A freaking shell! I don't need a shell!
4859000	4863000	I actually am starting to wonder if they even coded
4863000	4867000	any hearts to drop in these pots.
4867000	4871000	Yeah, thanks for the five rupees. That is useless for me right now.
4871000	4875000	Do you have fairies? Oh, I do have fairies!
4875000	4879000	Alright, I'll use one fairy.
4879000	4883000	That will have to do.
4883000	4887000	There is a possibility.
4887000	4891000	We don't do this, you know that?
4891000	4895000	We might have to go back and get more.
4895000	4899000	Thank you for your...
4899000	4903000	Yeah, you're more than welcome.
4903000	4907000	Ah!
4907000	4911000	Of course a heart drops when I've dunked the fairy.
4911000	4915000	Ah!
4915000	4919000	Oh, Justin no more.
4919000	4923000	Yeah? Okay, well...
4923000	4927000	Shadow Wizard? I'm gonna get it.
4927000	4931000	Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
4931000	4935000	Don't do that again. Jesus, I was cheating.
4935000	4939000	Oh, they're giving these kinsome pieces though, because I kinda need to trade.
4939000	4943000	They're gonna lie.
4943000	4947000	Don't fight me, bro.
4947000	4951000	Give me a heart! Give me a heart! Don't be shy! Give me a heart!
4951000	4955000	Can I whack him when I'm around?
4955000	4959000	I'm just going for it.
4959000	4963000	I'm just going for it. We are getting so low health.
4963000	4967000	We are getting so low health!
4967000	4971000	Oh my god. That for a key?
4971000	4975000	Something has to give.
4975000	4979000	Something has to give.
4979000	4983000	Wait, can I just permanently get rid of this guy?
4983000	4987000	Fuck you!
4987000	4991000	Did they always drop fairies?
4991000	4995000	New Zelda lore?
4995000	4999000	Did they always drop fairies when you whack them? Or was that just like really good
4999000	5003000	rear drop?
5003000	5007000	Get in my bowl! Get in the jar!
5007000	5011000	What? No!
5011000	5015000	No way!
5019000	5023000	Oh my god, we got the big key, but we still don't have the teleport.
5023000	5027000	We didn't drop fairies! Fuckin' get hit ya! Bam!
5027000	5031000	Give me that right now. Right, we've got two fairies.
5031000	5035000	Oh my god, learning!
5035000	5039000	Ronnie talking to Reflings. I just called you guys Ronnie there.
5039000	5043000	Ronnie and Reflings together becomes Ronnie!
5043000	5047000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, and all the hearts are here. Oh god.
5047000	5051000	Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I'm no good with heights.
5051000	5055000	Hold on, I think I see something down there.
5055000	5059000	I guess that means we have to take the plunge after all.
5059000	5063000	Oh shi...
5063000	5067000	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5067000	5071000	I've got my wee tiny shield. You be nice to...
5071000	5075000	I looked the wrong way! No! I'm at full health! Oh my god, sorry.
5075000	5079000	I'm having a stroke. Link keeps looking so. I don't know why.
5079000	5083000	I don't know why.
5089000	5093000	How big is his freakin' sweat?
5093000	5097000	Ah!
5097000	5101000	Oh, I need my shield.
5109000	5113000	Why is it he can push me off the map?
5113000	5117000	But when I go to push him off the map, that's no possible.
5117000	5121000	And then he says I'm a wane. I've literally...
5129000	5133000	Is that gonna work?
5133000	5137000	What am I doing? I'm having a stroke but not the good kind!
5137000	5141000	Oh!
5141000	5145000	I'm having a stroke but not the good kind!
5145000	5149000	Oh my god!
5149000	5153000	Right, I'm just gonna keep coming back and forth.
5153000	5157000	I was getting absolutely rolled. That is embarrassing how bad that went.
5157000	5161000	I need to keep coming back to respawn the hearts. I'm so sorry.
5161000	5165000	Mapologies, mapologies.
5165000	5169000	Yeah, we're definitely
5169000	5173000	exploring to get the rest of the hearts. Because if I'm making and the rest of the
5173000	5177000	jars, if I'm making mistakes like that,
5177000	5181000	we ain't gonna be making it through anything. This is supposed to be
5181000	5185000	a game for children question mark? Absolutely not.
5185000	5189000	Because that is insane. Right, let's go.
5189000	5193000	Is there like 10 Pokemon sound effects
5193000	5197000	in one? What do you mean?
5197000	5201000	How much further do we have to go? This place goes on forever. There's no point in complaining
5201000	5205000	about it. We must press on more. After all, how much more could there be? Come on Link, let's go.
5205000	5209000	I like how the game acknowledges this area is so vast and
5209000	5213000	ridiculous. Okay, hearts.
5213000	5217000	Oh, no.
5217000	5221000	I do not consent.
5221000	5225000	Okay, hug someone else.
5225000	5229000	Okay, up the stairs.
5229000	5233000	What's up here? Slames.
5233000	5237000	Okay, let's suck these guys off.
5237000	5241000	Aw, I could have got a double kill there.
5241000	5245000	Um...
5245000	5249000	Mom.
5249000	5253000	Oh, that's what I didn't want.
5253000	5257000	I assume I need to do that.
5257000	5261000	Well, maybe if you weren't so selfish
5261000	5265000	and now I'm gonna have to restart the room and do that
5265000	5269000	all over again. I should have been new. Oh, I kept them all
5269000	5273000	perished. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
5273000	5277000	Don't be nervous. Don't be shy. Is anyone online
5277000	5281000	right now that I need to shout out from the Allure?
5281000	5285000	Any of the Allures online?
5285000	5289000	Or what's the situation? Oh, I can jump over these.
5289000	5293000	I was like, aw, I can't do anything about that.
5293000	5297000	Wee! Oh, just
5297000	5301000	no more. I got a kill. Sheeby and Azura
5301000	5305000	in 30. Oh my god, that's right. They're playing
5305000	5309000	um, they're playing Jelly Bean game.
5309000	5313000	Uh, if anyone wants to join them, you can.
5313000	5317000	Oh, sorry, I'm to jump into it. My apologies. Yes, I'm to jump
5317000	5321000	into it. Yes, I knew that. Okay, well, I completely missed a lot.
5321000	5325000	Wee!
5325000	5329000	Uh, yes, they are going to load up a lobby first
5329000	5333000	and give each other, get each other in the lobby
5333000	5337000	and then they're going to reveal the code so you can
5337000	5341000	Jelly Bean snipe, uh, Sheeby and Azura.
5341000	5345000	Yeah, okay. Jelly Bean game!
5345000	5349000	Uh, this is my problem.
5349000	5353000	I don't know if they just continually respawn.
5353000	5357000	It's very plausible that they do.
5357000	5361000	Can I not? Okay, I was going to say, can I not do that?
5361000	5365000	Uh, no. You're in
5365000	5369000	my way. Please don't do that again.
5369000	5373000	Uh,
5373000	5377000	I've just done a 360.
5377000	5381000	Ow, where?
5381000	5385000	Um, I think I need to jump down
5385000	5389000	in the middle here. You know that? You know that? I'm getting a memory.
5389000	5393000	I'm getting a memory! Oh, I love Childhood Me.
5393000	5397000	You're so smart. Thank you for coming. We're literally saving this run
5397000	5401000	right now. Childhood Me, I'm not even joking.
5401000	5405000	We got a...
5405000	5409000	Yeah, I'll take that heart, please.
5409000	5413000	Great. So we go up here again.
5413000	5417000	Core memory found. Literally accessing
5417000	5421000	core memory. Right, and then...
5421000	5425000	Oh, you lose health so quick in this game.
5429000	5433000	Hold on a minute. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let me try again.
5433000	5437000	Let me try again.
5437000	5441000	That's it. Let him get up. Let him get up.
5441000	5445000	If it's gonna be safer going all the way around, I will go all the way around
5445000	5449000	because, bruh, let him get up.
5449000	5453000	Let me redo. Give me a shot. As if this is safer.
5453000	5457000	I think I actually is, though.
5457000	5461000	Lulululu...
5461000	5465000	Lulululu...
5465000	5469000	Lulululu...
5469000	5473000	Okay.
5477000	5481000	Why am I so premature
5481000	5485000	with my fricking actions?
5485000	5489000	Man...
5489000	5493000	I could have sworn.
5493000	5497000	Okay, let's try that again. Let him get...let me get up. Let me go.
5497000	5501000	There! As everyone is my witness, I am on it.
5501000	5505000	Right, so what's up here? Okay, it is definitely
5505000	5509000	a lot faster just to go the other way. I'm not gonna lie.
5509000	5513000	Oh, that's a jump down on water.
5513000	5517000	We have an ability to jump down that way if we still desire.
5517000	5521000	So then water's over here.
5521000	5525000	Yeah.
5525000	5529000	Shadow Wizard money. Oh, I can't do it.
5541000	5545000	I'm gonna need a cup of tea and I'm gonna...
5545000	5549000	I'm gonna need a fricking cup of tea.
5549000	5553000	I'm nuking this...I'm nuking this place into oblivion.
5553000	5557000	Yeah, that's what you get.
5557000	5561000	Do I even have anything that does damage?
5565000	5569000	Put me on fire, will you? Yeah, bam!
5569000	5573000	Didn't even insult me like that. Right, what we got? What we got? What's the...
5573000	5577000	A dungeon map? Well, I didn't even need it.
5577000	5581000	Thanks anyway.
5581000	5585000	Yeah, you're no grabbing me.
5585000	5589000	You're no grabbing me. Good luck.
5593000	5597000	No, no! Get me up the stairs.
5597000	5601000	Get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs.
5601000	5605000	Oh, why so many?
5605000	5609000	A child's game, by the way.
5609000	5613000	Right, fuck it, we're jumping over here.
5613000	5617000	I don't know why we're jumping over here, but we're just going for it.
5617000	5621000	We're sending it. Oh, okay, I'll take that.
5621000	5625000	You now have three. Just collect one more and we'll get another unlock.
5625000	5629000	We've got a city to burn. Scottish Rage Charging. No, no, I'm calm.
5629000	5633000	I'm calm, I'm calm. Oh, I have to go down.
5633000	5637000	Okay, I'll go down.
5641000	5645000	See, you're not the only one that can jump your bams, honestly.
5645000	5649000	Right, we went left, so now we have to go right.
5649000	5655000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
5655000	5659000	I don't even know where we are.
5659000	5663000	I don't even know where we are.
5663000	5667000	A freaking rock.
5667000	5671000	At least I got a kingstone piece. Where the heck are we?
5671000	5675000	Oh, fuck, fucks sake!
5675000	5679000	We have fucking offerty.
5679000	5683000	What the fuck do I need to go? Right, not that way.
5683000	5687000	We'll go all the way back.
5691000	5695000	As if you guys respawn!
5695000	5699000	Yeah, we're definitely
5699000	5703000	exploring. I'm getting like full health.
5703000	5707000	No, no, not the fire though, not the fire though. As long as I don't get the fire,
5707000	5711000	because as soon as you get given the fire, right.
5713000	5717000	You perish. Alright, I know what to do.
5721000	5725000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5725000	5729000	Come on.
5729000	5733000	Get in, get me in.
5733000	5737000	Oh my god, how much health do you have?
5737000	5741000	Ay, yay, yay!
5741000	5745000	Followed me at the convention like...
5745000	5749000	Jeez, I'm getting absolutely wrecked.
5749000	5753000	This is probably the hardest...
5753000	5757000	This has to be the hardest part of the game.
5757000	5761000	Bro, this is getting outrageous.
5761000	5765000	Oh, please don't run off the map, Link.
5765000	5769000	I know your arse is on fire, but please...
5769000	5773000	For me, for me, Link. For me, Linky-Poo.
5773000	5777000	Whatever the heck is this wizard?
5777000	5781000	That's the spells.
5781000	5785000	Oh my god, right.
5785000	5789000	There's a bomb that has to go here, I'm pretty sure.
5789000	5793000	This is the worst. Literally, I have to admit, like, all of a sudden, this is, like, tedious.
5797000	5801000	No game developer wants your game to be...
5805000	5809000	Huh?
5813000	5817000	Am I not?
5817000	5821000	Oh, I have to...
5821000	5825000	Easy.
5829000	5833000	Easy, I'm just...
5837000	5841000	Wow, I'm so skinny.
5841000	5845000	Actually so skinny, so I had to hold my breath for that when I was like...
5845000	5849000	I had to suck in, I had to go...
5849000	5853000	Oh, there's the door! We're, like, right at the boss fight!
5853000	5857000	I don't think I'm...
5857000	5861000	It doesn't matter.
5861000	5865000	Okay, we're right at the boss fight.
5865000	5869000	We can do it! We're so close, replay! We're so freaking close!
5869000	5873000	Right, so I don't need to do anything here.
5873000	5877000	What do I need to do then?
5877000	5881000	Oh!
5881000	5885000	See you, jumping on my head.
5885000	5889000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hug someone else. Where's my hug?
5893000	5897000	Huh?
5897000	5901000	I think I got another.
5901000	5905000	What is it?
5905000	5909000	I need to go back already.
5909000	5913000	Wait, what's going on over here then?
5917000	5921000	Hold on, I've missed something. I've missed a...
5921000	5925000	I've missed a vital clue. What have I missed?
5925000	5929000	A boomerang? Can boomerang even go over?
5929000	5933000	Hello?
5933000	5937000	Hit the switch with a bomb.
5937000	5941000	As if that was the move!
5941000	5945000	That wasn't even on the same pixel tail, like...
5945000	5949000	That wasn't even on the same tail! How is that supposed to figure that out?
5949000	5953000	Oh my god, they're paling me with money as a sorry.
5959000	5963000	I need to drop down?
5963000	5967000	Am I going crazy?
5967000	5971000	I have to go up
5971000	5975000	in order to go down, but only up and a little to the left.
5975000	5979000	Okay...
5979000	5983000	Up and a little to the left, so there's something to the...that can fall down up here.
5983000	5987000	But I need to fall down on the left side.
5987000	5991000	I come friend, I come friend!
5991000	5995000	I'm learning, going!
5995000	5999000	I need to fall here.
5999000	6003000	Oh!
6003000	6007000	I'm so fucking smart! And this game is just proving how smart I am.
6017000	6021000	Alright, stop charging bro. I can't hit you if you're charging me.
6021000	6025000	I can't hit you if you're charging me and I'm not full health.
6025000	6029000	Oh! Bro! You're not even in the same tail as me!
6029000	6033000	Glowy.
6033000	6037000	I'm going to start dropping bombs.
6037000	6041000	And the Legend of Zelda. The hit video game.
6041000	6045000	Legend of Zelda.
6045000	6049000	Well, I didn't...
6049000	6053000	Can I just shoot?
6053000	6057000	Link, sorry.
6057000	6061000	Alright, how do I...
6061000	6065000	Just jump?
6065000	6069000	Oh! How am I supposed to make a mini jump?
6069000	6073000	A mini jump.
6073000	6077000	Okay, we did it, we did it.
6077000	6081000	Shadow Wizard minigame. We look.
6081000	6085000	Oh, I fucked that one up, didn't I?
6085000	6089000	Yes, I fucked that one up.
6089000	6093000	That was fine, I'll reset when we go up.
6093000	6097000	I think this is the ball?
6097000	6101000	I think?
6101000	6105000	Please be easier. Oh my god, we're still going?
6105000	6109000	Give it a break!
6109000	6113000	Alright, sorry, sorry, sorry.
6113000	6117000	I've got one fairy to my aid.
6117000	6121000	I just need to not mess this up.
6121000	6125000	Let's not mess this up. We should watch you play a puzzle game.
6125000	6129000	It just ends up with me swearing.
6129000	6133000	Okay, okay. I'm already seeing something that I need to.
6133000	6137000	Some. Okay.
6137000	6141000	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
6141000	6145000	Phase 1 already complete, question mark?
6145000	6149000	Phase 1 complete, question mark. Please let me on.
6149000	6153000	Do I need to get on? I don't know. Is that supposed to jump on that?
6153000	6157000	I don't know. Nope.
6157000	6161000	I'm not...
6161000	6165000	What do you want from me?
6165000	6169000	What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Do you want me to get on you? I don't know. Oh, okay.
6169000	6173000	You've just killed me. I just refused to let me on you.
6173000	6177000	Maybe I was supposed to jump on you? How is I supposed to know that?
6177000	6181000	How is I supposed to know that?
6181000	6185000	It's fine. I didn't need the HP.
6185000	6189000	It's fine. I didn't need the HP.
6189000	6193000	It's fine. I didn't need the HP.
6193000	6197000	So the blue guy is not friendly.
6197000	6201000	Go on and fucking spam it!
6201000	6205000	I didn't do it. Oh, I didn't do it.
6205000	6209000	Hold on. Hold on. I'm fucking dodging me. I'm fucking dodging.
6209000	6213000	Wait, hold on. I don't want him to get me.
6213000	6217000	Okay, here we go. Now jump on his back.
6217000	6221000	Jump on blue. Okay, I'm on blue.
6221000	6225000	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You like that? You like that? You see that?
6225000	6229000	Power and skill. Jump! Okay, it's fine. It's fine. I've got a fairy.
6229000	6233000	I've got a fairy. I've got a fairy.
6233000	6237000	Why the heck are there so many? I don't even remember.
6237000	6241000	You need to jump. Please jump. Oh my god, please. Please.
6241000	6245000	Please. Please! Why is he doing backflips?
6245000	6249000	Fuck it!
6249000	6253000	No! The HP can't take anymore!
6253000	6257000	I might lose this. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually released.
6257000	6261000	I'm not confident. I'm not confident.
6261000	6265000	But that's not going to stop me. That's not going to stop me. Jump on his back.
6265000	6269000	Okay, completely miss his back. It's fine. Okay, jump on his back.
6269000	6273000	Okay, okay. Easy. Easy. Easy.
6273000	6277000	Easy. Easy. Take it. No! Don't jump! Why would it not be
6277000	6281000	sequenced to his freaking back? Why would you do that?
6281000	6285000	Why would you do that? Get... Oh, I'm going to need calling a fairy.
6285000	6289000	Get on his back right now. Jeez, love.
6289000	6293000	Right, bro. If the game doesn't put me on his back, what do you actually want me to do?
6293000	6297000	What do you want me...
6297000	6301000	We ain't going to do it. I think I'm actually going to die here. Oh my god.
6301000	6305000	Stop! He keeps, like, purposely going away.
6305000	6309000	Oh, get to fuck. Oh my god, did we do it?
6309000	6313000	Oh, thanks again for dropping me. No, it's fine.
6313000	6317000	I didn't want to win. It's fine.
6317000	6321000	Child's game, by the way. Child's game, by the way!
6321000	6325000	And you just nuked my freaking allies.
6325000	6329000	Ooh, it actually doesn't really seem
6329000	6333000	to matter what... Oh my god, we did it.
6333000	6337000	Don't ever make me do that again. Why was that so hard?
6337000	6341000	My hands were sweating. My hands are literally sweating
6341000	6345000	so much right now. Why was that so hard?
6345000	6349000	Oh. Oh, it's a snail.
6349000	6353000	That's wind?
6353000	6357000	Is that wind? Why would the wind look like that? Shouldn't it not be, like,
6357000	6361000	a cloud or, like, three little wings? You got the wind element!
6361000	6365000	The wind carries the seeds of flowers scattering life across the lands.
6365000	6369000	That's called wind dispersal on seeds. The wind element is the embodiment
6369000	6373000	of that power. Yeah, me, though!
6373000	6377000	Okay, we now have even more health, which I will take.
6377000	6381000	Get me out here. Get me out.
6381000	6385000	At last, we've got all four elements. Let's go
6385000	6389000	revive the sacred blade. Now this is where everything goes to
6389000	6393000	Judy Kaka. Bruh, I need a victory
6393000	6397000	cup of tea after that. I'm not even kidding. I need a victory cup of tea.
6397000	6401000	Hello, Elder. Now would you like to fuse?
6401000	6405000	Poster check.
6405000	6409000	Currently a shrimp, the way I like it.
6409000	6413000	A chest in the graveyard?
6413000	6417000	Yeah, yeah. I'll take it. I'll take it.
6417000	6421000	Oh, they fit perfectly. Right. There's a tornado at the top of the winds.
6421000	6425000	Receive the blade. I already did. I thought her dialogue was going to change, actually.
6425000	6429000	Okay, I'll get ready. No, no, no.
6429000	6433000	Kaka. Oh, we can trade with you as well. You want green.
6433000	6437000	We destroyed like a billion monsters that need green. Or that drop green, sorry.
6437000	6441000	Yes, I am going
6441000	6445000	to basically do all the side stuff. Like,
6445000	6449000	no. We'll play gacha. How about that? We'll play gacha
6449000	6453000	for a bit.
6453000	6457000	You guys have so much money. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
6457000	6461000	I'm going to upgrade our quiver size, not to be confused
6461000	6465000	with you quivering last night to
6465000	6469000	my audio. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all week. That's not even funny.
6469000	6473000	Oh. Well, when I said it wasn't funny, you didn't have to actually
6473000	6477000	announce that it wasn't funny. Okay.
6477000	6481000	Mate, when I explore before, yes, I absolutely will.
6481000	6485000	Where do we start?
6485000	6489000	Like, where do we start? Tomato, tomato.
6489000	6493000	There's still a few things you need but to fill store, but no, everything. Yes. Okay, the
6493000	6497000	town hasn't gone to Shisa yet. So, I'm actually
6497000	6501000	right. We have the cape.
6501000	6505000	How the fuck do you get in here?
6505000	6509000	I don't know how I get that. But yes,
6509000	6513000	there is like, all the
6513000	6517000	weasels floating about on itself. Do everything you've done before you completely
6517000	6521000	hit the sword because this is the point of no return.
6521000	6525000	I already did him and he gave me a heart, I'm pretty sure.
6525000	6529000	The door's shut. We can't open it from the side.
6529000	6533000	Why can't he open it from any other side either? Alright, let me upgrade our quiver size.
6533000	6537000	Oh, the quiver. Yes, that.
6537000	6541000	Kin stone the door, most likely. You are a big
6541000	6545000	gender. There's a way you get in that house.
6545000	6549000	Right. Oh, are we laundry?
6549000	6553000	Hi, Link. If you have an empty ball, I can put one of my charms
6553000	6557000	inside. Oh, that's cute.
6557000	6561000	Oh, something red, so it's something good.
6561000	6565000	You have to get every figure in
6565000	6569000	the gacha. What does a butterfly do?
6569000	6573000	What does a butterfly do?
6573000	6577000	What does a butterfly do?
6577000	6581000	I don't know. Oh, she's got to be laundry.
6581000	6585000	Oh, wait, you're that ghost. I met your brother.
6585000	6589000	Don't worry, I'm already looking for another job.
6589000	6593000	Oh.
6593000	6597000	I think we can also learn a new technique
6597000	6601000	because we've got the cape now. Imagine watching like, I don't know
6601000	6605000	how old Link is lore-wise, but imagine watching like a 12 year old jump
6605000	6609000	of it with a cape. You have the cape. You have acquired a new skill.
6609000	6613000	I'm ready to train you. Yes, I would like to train, please. Now I will teach you how to take three.
6613000	6617000	The down thrust. First, equip the cape. Second, equip the sword.
6617000	6621000	Jump, and then at your jump's peak, thingy. Yes, I understand.
6621000	6625000	You see it, do you not? What does it do? I must possess you.
6625000	6629000	Oh, no.
6629000	6633000	Oh, I like that.
6633000	6637000	Wait. Hold on a minute.
6637000	6641000	Am I not AB?
6641000	6645000	Okay, there we go. Sorry, sorry to be a little second there.
6645000	6649000	My apologies, my apologies. Please do not look at me in the eyes. I'm
6649000	6653000	rather embarrassed with that move. Joy butterfly's appear.
6653000	6657000	Catch a joy, increase Link's speed while digging, swimming, or shooting. Oh, okay.
6657000	6661000	There's nothing more I can teach you. Now you must train yourself. Okay, we can now go to the other
6661000	6665000	masters to get trained up. Right, we'll do some gachapon,
6665000	6669000	since we actually need to do it in order to get full
6669000	6673000	health. Are you guys feeling lucky?
6673000	6677000	Oh, hello. Yeah, trade. I really
6677000	6681000	wish you could do it all in one go, and before we get like another one that we already have.
6681000	6685000	Gambit time.
6685000	6689000	Down throws. Big octa rock.
6689000	6693000	Octa rock is such a good ASMR trigger word.
6693000	6697000	Octa rock, octa rock, octa rock. I'll be saying that in my next
6697000	6701000	ASMR video. Octa rock.
6701000	6705000	Gambit time. What are we going to get?
6705000	6709000	What are we going to get? We're going to get Percy.
6709000	6713000	Which I didn't actually solve his problem. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have access
6713000	6717000	to his house or something.
6717000	6721000	If you put extra in it increases your odds of not getting a duplicate. I don't want
6721000	6725000	to burn through it too much. Although
6725000	6729000	we do seem to be getting like tons of stuff anyway.
6729000	6733000	Strony calling you a good octa rock ASMR win. Oh no, I never looked.
6733000	6737000	Oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry, I didn't see what we just unlocked there.
6737000	6741000	I like your outfit, Strony. Thanks. I didn't model
6741000	6745000	it myself. I had no say.
6745000	6749000	But I like the bikini.
6749000	6753000	With the tape kind of thing. Okay, we got rope.
6753000	6757000	Not to be confused with Chibi.
6757000	6761000	T minus seven minutes until your beloved milfs are live together.
6761000	6765000	Playing the most predictable game of all.
6765000	6769000	Jelly bean game.
6769000	6773000	I'm actually a big fan of color combinations. I'm drawing you right now. Oh yeah?
6773000	6777000	You like my green? My vert? Is this in French or vert?
6777000	6781000	It's vert. 91% probability.
6781000	6785000	Look, 90% is not really high. Anything above 50% is like a one and two.
6785000	6789000	Although then again, you guys did see my luck.
6789000	6793000	The third time I freaking got it. Yeah, you better buy that
6793000	6797000	freaking figurine. At least you get money if you pull up the same thing again.
6797000	6801000	And what happened?
6801000	6805000	Exactly.
6805000	6809000	I can't. Oh!
6809000	6813000	The great dragonfly.
6813000	6817000	Dragonfly Vechiver? I'm actually
6817000	6821000	kind of down. Dragonfly Vechiver.
6821000	6825000	How would she look?
6825000	6829000	Would she have a toggle to open up her wings?
6829000	6833000	I mean, I like that. Dragonfly Vechiver.
6833000	6837000	I don't think I've heard of a dragonfly Vechiver. Oh, the forest bakori.
6837000	6841000	Very elegant and ladylike. Would a dragonfly
6841000	6845000	be a milf? Wait a minute!
6845000	6849000	The dragonfly would be a milf because if you didn't know, dragonflies are the most successful
6849000	6853000	predator.
6853000	6857000	Oh my god, I need someone who's in a shot or corner to play her.
6857000	6861000	Oh, that would be outrageous.
6861000	6865000	Yeah, that's
6865000	6869000	fucked. Yeah, that'd be outrageous. But that's funny as fuck.
6869000	6873000	And before I even put, oh, I'm triggered. Oh, go fuck off me.
6873000	6877000	I'm just leaving about. I've actually been getting in a model in Wings and 3D. Dragonfly
6877000	6881000	Vechiver. Munker.
6881000	6885000	Hire me, I'll do it, I'll do it.
6885000	6889000	A to A, geez, the probability going down.
6889000	6893000	As long as it's not a blight. A little too far. Oh, all right. Okay, okay.
6893000	6897000	My bad. Speaking of dragonfly.
6897000	6901000	So he gives me five rupees every time I have a duplicate, which I should be the goose.
6901000	6905000	Prey and Mantis Vechiver.
6905000	6909000	They don't have, I don't like Prey and Mantis.
6909000	6913000	Not far enough.
6913000	6917000	Oh, it's Mama's Cafe. This is the best place
6917000	6921000	in Tentorite. She can also pick up some good tips. I actually love this
6921000	6925000	little cute save mission thing. It's actually really sweet. I know it's not
6925000	6929000	like, sweet, sweet, but.
6929000	6933000	87%
6933000	6937000	Not far enough.
6937000	6941000	For anyone who is lurking and is like,
6941000	6945000	what on earth are you doing? We have finally unlocked all the items
6945000	6949000	in the Legend of Zelda Minish Cap and we are currently just doing all the side missions
6949000	6953000	because if we progress the story any further, basically
6953000	6957000	everything goes to Judi Kaka and it's not very
6957000	6961000	nice section of the game and the game unfortunately
6961000	6965000	is one of those games that reverts back every time you load up the same save.
6965000	6969000	So the town will not be restored and
6969000	6973000	you'll constantly have the ability to do the boss fight type thing.
6973000	6977000	And I'd rather have it fun time.
6977000	6981000	The Wind Tribe. God, this is so like 9.
6981000	6985000	I wonder how long development took on this game. I feel like a lot of love went into it.
6985000	6989000	You know, a lot of love, a lot of hard work tears.
6989000	6993000	I never heard anything bad about the development of Game Boy games, to be honest.
6993000	6997000	But then again, I guess back then you never really ask those kind of questions.
6997000	7001000	Like, oh, is, you know,
7001000	7005000	how was development? How is this? How is that? Like it was all insider thingy.
7005000	7009000	But now like development teams in that are being so open and honest
7009000	7013000	and like saying like this is what's happening, this is what we're doing next, the type thing.
7013000	7017000	It came, it took Nintendo two years to come up with this beautiful game.
7017000	7021000	That's fantastic. It really is
7021000	7025000	a beautiful game. Really, really.
7025000	7029000	I love it.
7029000	7033000	They're paying you rupees for
7033000	7037000	JPEGs, honestly. I think this came out. Pina
7037000	7041000	Hyrule's Fruit Vendor. She hates vegetables. She won't even sell
7041000	7045000	tomatoes even though they technically are fruits. Freak!
7045000	7049000	Oh my god, Nintendo!
7049000	7053000	Steady on, some folk just dinny like certain palettes. You know, everyone's tongues a wee bit different.
7053000	7057000	Oh my god, that is a Nintendo.
7057000	7061000	Well, literally, they're
7061000	7065000	brutal. They like their fresh veggies.
7065000	7069000	Mayor Hagen, the mayor of the town of Hyrule, he's a big collector of odd mass.
7069000	7073000	He's built a shelter in his garden just in case monsters attack Hyrule.
7073000	7077000	He knew. Is he a body?
7077000	7081000	She a fur diver. Every time I hear that I am
7081000	7085000	Jingle, I'm the last one trailing off forever.
7085000	7089000	Meeps.
7089000	7093000	Nintendo went crazy for that one. Hagen Love, you liked that the mayor
7093000	7097000	of the town does nothing? Oh, and Eni and Meenie,
7097000	7101000	the high-reliant vegetable growing in their fields are exquisitely delicious.
7101000	7105000	Apparently, Brocco sells some of their crops.
7105000	7109000	They've got like little lore for all the townsfolk. Oh come on, give me a game
7109000	7113000	where it's about restoring a town, please. I'd love it. I'd go absolutely.
7113000	7117000	Oh, there's this game that's coming out that's called like...
7117000	7121000	It's like a hotel game. You run it.
7121000	7125000	Oh, Stockwell and his wee pup. Oh my god, he's called
7125000	7129000	Stockwell because he's well-stocked.
7129000	7133000	There's this hotel coming out, but it's like
7133000	7137000	you're playing Vampire or something.
7137000	7141000	And I don't know if it's in Early Access right now
7141000	7145000	or they're about to do Early Access.
7145000	7149000	Sheebie is live. Is there a...
7149000	7153000	Ezlo has Link, a young boy on a quest with Ezlo to restore the four
7153000	7157000	swords with the sword's power he hopes to remove the curse of Princess Zelda.
7157000	7161000	Join Sheebie and Ezra live on Fall Games.
7161000	7165000	Yes, if you want to play with Sheepsters and Ezra on Fall Guys,
7165000	7169000	you can do that right now. I kid you not, they are doing it right now.
7169000	7173000	As long as you don't mess up tea.
7173000	7177000	Yes, we are literally just playing
7177000	7181000	Zelda and finishing the main quest
7181000	7185000	and all that today. I don't know how long it's going to take. I thought it was only
7185000	7189000	going to take four hours, but considering we're at the two hour mark
7189000	7193000	and I've made no progress, um, yeah.
7193000	7197000	It's fine. It's fine. This might be a little bit of an
7197000	7201000	endurance stream. Dr. Le, a gruff talking academic type who says
7201000	7205000	he's studying the PCORI. He doesn't seem to be aware that they're actually living in his own house.
7205000	7209000	Aw. If you're looking for an older RPG
7209000	7213000	that has rebuilding, look into... look at Dark...
7213000	7217000	look at Dark Cloud or Dark Chronicle. Oh, I love like the repair
7217000	7221000	ability in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed 2.
7221000	7225000	You get to like repair either Monty Regione
7225000	7229000	or Rigatoni, whatever you want to call it.
7229000	7233000	Scissorblades, that's actually a pretty good name for them. Or you get to repair like
7233000	7237000	Roma and I really like that aspect of like fixing it up and like the environment
7237000	7241000	changes as you fix stuff up and like you go on quest to do it.
7241000	7245000	I would absolutely love to develop some kind of game around that.
7245000	7249000	I've not met you yet.
7249000	7253000	A great butterfly... oh no, in the Minish Woods.
7253000	7257000	I have met you.
7257000	7261000	Oh, I didn't realize the fairies were different types.
7261000	7265000	Like a dragonfly, a butterfly. So what's the... is it the blue one I've not
7265000	7269000	met yet? No progress blasts through that part of the game.
7269000	7273000	I mean, we got the last elemental, that's all we need.
7273000	7277000	Past that coded...
7277000	7281000	Bro just said Rigatoni. Oh, sugar, that was a joy butterfly.
7281000	7285000	I probably could have read that, honestly, but...
7285000	7289000	We're trying to get through it. What's our percentage now?
7289000	7293000	75%, ooh. It's getting low.
7293000	7297000	How low can you go? How low can you go?
7297000	7301000	Not exactly retro, but Bastion has a little bit of that and it's a good game.
7301000	7305000	I haven't played Bastion.
7305000	7309000	I don't... the only Bastion I've played is...
7309000	7313000	Shoulda picked Mercy. Shoulda picked any kind of support.
7313000	7317000	We ended up losing. All your fault, your tears are what I
7317000	7321000	live for.
7321000	7325000	Leaver appears in Wild Runes real full. These baddies
7325000	7329000	are really underground. You never know where they might pop up. Keep your shield raised and ready.
7337000	7341000	Your race will win, Stan. I wanna be Winston.
7345000	7349000	Uh...
7349000	7353000	Lucky 2. Lucky 2 appears in the sky.
7353000	7357000	I can't move, but they throw lightning bolts, steal their clothes with the gust star.
7357000	7361000	Oh, like how it actually gives you a base on how it flew.
7361000	7365000	Oh, Monkers. Monkers, I've got DMs in the discord. What does it mean?
7369000	7373000	Um...
7373000	7377000	Oh, okay, it's just one of the girls requesting something.
7377000	7381000	That's fine.
7381000	7385000	And Shibi might be cooking up something that I wholeheartedly support.
7385000	7389000	So I might need to get her a few assets for that, which is perfectly fine.
7389000	7393000	My apologies, a little bit distracted.
7393000	7397000	I can't believe it.
7397000	7401000	Shibi, unbelievably, came up with a concept that I
7401000	7405000	actually was considering.
7405000	7409000	But it wasn't possible for me to do it
7409000	7413000	because of timing issues, I didn't have enough time to pursue such a project.
7413000	7417000	However, Shibi just came out with it and I was like...
7417000	7421000	I've not told her that I actually had an interest in that,
7421000	7425000	but I will 100% support it if she's interested in it. I'm not really sure how to go about it though,
7425000	7429000	because it's a bit hot to track down.
7429000	7433000	But yes, we'll see. We'll see how it goes.
7433000	7437000	You just killed him, I did.
7437000	7441000	Please read it out loud. No, I can!
7441000	7445000	Don't get me wrong, I'm a blabbermouth. I can hardly hide anything that I'm interested in.
7445000	7449000	But that is not a project that a
7449000	7453000	beetle appears in various areas.
7453000	7457000	It is not for me to spill beans about.
7457000	7461000	I spill many beans, and I flick many.
7461000	7465000	But that's not for me.
7465000	7469000	Probably 50% and then we'll take a break, I'll go get a honey tea because my wee voice box is already...
7469000	7473000	Oh, Nairu!
7473000	7477000	Nairu, she's looking for a house in Hyrule to move into. She's a descendant from a line of oracles
7477000	7481000	of the land of Labriana. I'm going to say that's probably a reference to another
7481000	7485000	Zeldor game that I've not played.
7485000	7489000	Yes, probability 50% and then we'll have a quick break. Beans and tea
7489000	7493000	all over. Oh, okay.
7493000	7497000	Vacuum pumped beans, no thank.
7497000	7501000	Do you have anything cooking which not even the girls know about?
7501000	7505000	Oh, I've already heard that one. Um, that the girls don't know about?
7509000	7513000	I have monthly events.
7513000	7517000	I did post the old monthly events, but some of them are outdated
7517000	7521000	and can no longer be utilized. Oh no, our probability dropped.
7521000	7525000	We'll have to get two in a row that we've had.
7525000	7529000	So, in July
7529000	7533000	is
7533000	7537000	Minecraft server with the girls.
7537000	7541000	The video game comes out as long as we don't hit any issues.
7541000	7545000	Aw, peaceful Hyrule.
7545000	7549000	I love that I just got back and you're talking about our flicking beans.
7549000	7553000	Oh no, I'm not. Broly legend. I'm talking about beans on toast.
7553000	7557000	Cause I'm British.
7557000	7561000	Thank you for the tip of the super chat. I'll take it.
7561000	7565000	Is the Minecraft server going to have mods or be vanilla?
7565000	7569000	I think Emmy might want it to have mods. I always like vanilla, but
7569000	7573000	it's up to her.
7573000	7577000	I guess it's up to her. Whatever she wants to do.
7577000	7581000	Shaders are instance based, so she puts shaders on.
7581000	7585000	I don't have to see it. 68% on probability.
7585000	7589000	We're getting there. We're getting lower.
7589000	7593000	And after yesterday, I thought Stranny wasn't vanilla. I'm not that bad.
7593000	7597000	I didn't think it was that bad.
7597000	7601000	What was that?
7601000	7605000	Just...
7605000	7609000	When does the Veil or Game come out and where can I purchase it?
7609000	7613000	It is free to play. It will come out on itch.io and you will know about it.
7613000	7617000	Ah, sugar! We're really starting to hit the
7617000	7621000	repeats.
7621000	7625000	Since you said you wanted vanilla Minecraft.
7625000	7629000	Azura's Dona Thon is the event
7629000	7633000	for August, although I am going to try and ask
7633000	7637000	if a VTuber that does game shows will host a
7637000	7641000	game show for us. I just need to get all the assets together.
7641000	7645000	If you didn't know, in order to have a high acceptability
7645000	7649000	rate on collabs, if you do all the work, people are much more likely
7649000	7653000	to accept.
7653000	7657000	I currently have to do that and put it all together.
7657000	7661000	I basically have to reach out and be like, hey, do you want to host all the Veil
7661000	7665000	or girls in a collab? None of us will stream it, so you'll get all the views.
7665000	7669000	Oh, by the way, I've actually planned out the entirety of the game show, so all you have
7669000	7673000	to do is take these assets and files and put them where they belong
7673000	7677000	and then you get to have everything.
7677000	7681000	Yeah, basically. So I'm going to try and get that done. I don't know if
7681000	7685000	they're going to accept the person that I do want to
7685000	7689000	host it is going to accept.
7689000	7693000	Because they are incredibly busy with projects
7693000	7697000	all the time. But you know what,
7697000	7701000	in this world, if you don't ask and be a cheeky shit,
7701000	7705000	you don't get... I was talking to Hexa
7705000	7709000	because she was going to do a watch along, but she felt ill
7709000	7713000	or she had to go to hospital and all of that. And I just checked up on her
7713000	7717000	and I was like, I hope you're doing all right now. And I was like, I know this is cheeky
7717000	7721000	but do you want to do an ASMR collab? And she was like, fuck you. And I'm like, oh, okay, shit.
7721000	7725000	Like, if you don't ask and you don't get in this world, people might be
7725000	7729000	like, I'm so embarrassed to be rejected by someone for not doing a collab or whatever.
7729000	7733000	Bruv. Bruv. Either they'll say yes or no.
7733000	7737000	And guess what? If they say no, that's not a reflection of your character, that's not a reflection
7737000	7741000	of your work, that's not a reflection of your content. Someone
7741000	7745000	might just know before it and that's okay. Like, then you'd be afraid
7745000	7749000	to put yourself out there. Like, literally, I've got what? Six ASMR
7749000	7753000	collabs planned? I mean, I'm about to reach out
7753000	7757000	to more folk. Aww. Cat-less Link.
7757000	7761000	I hate that I put Link in all caps now. This is killing me
7761000	7765000	on the inside. ASMR in the hospital
7765000	7769000	but you missed 100%. No, she's not in hospital, then who? Will there
7769000	7773000	be a link on Discord? Actually, I don't know.
7773000	7777000	Discord. I can't...
7777000	7781000	The main viewer on Twitter can't talk about it but all the girls
7781000	7785000	alts can talk about it.
7785000	7789000	But yeah, then there's
7789000	7793000	another seven ASMR
7793000	7797000	collab coming out. Well, there's actually three more in the works. I'm waiting for this
7797000	7801000	animator to come back because they're taking their
7801000	7805000	sweet arse time and it's kind of just holding up the old
7805000	7809000	Oh, Farori. Farori, she's looking for a house. We're sure to got one.
7809000	7813000	Looking for a man in finance.
7813000	7817000	Eh, right. Want to do... What percentage are we at?
7817000	7821000	When can I make my cup of tea? 62%.
7821000	7825000	Okay, we're getting there. Once we hit 50%, cup of tea time. Do I make
7825000	7829000	myself clear? You will all get up, you will all stretch your legs, you will all go
7829000	7833000	and poop poop. Well, I don't know how fast you can go a poop poop.
7833000	7837000	We're at 100 rupees because we're absolutely burning through it.
7837000	7841000	Sadly, you cannot give all three a house.
7841000	7845000	I know! It's absolutely nonsense. And I
7845000	7849000	realise I actually shouldn't have put that green girl in a house because her reward
7849000	7853000	is she can dye your clothes a certain colour
7853000	7857000	but we're already green. So why does she even offer that as a reward?
7857000	7861000	Who knows?
7861000	7865000	One of them. We're at 61%. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
7865000	7869000	I already have popcorn. Do I have to stretch? Yes, everyone has to stretch.
7869000	7873000	What? Goron merchant. Oh no!
7873000	7877000	I just realise we haven't helped that poor Goron. Right, we're going to do it.
7877000	7881000	He needs more buddies. We'll get more buddies. I think what we'll do is we'll take
7881000	7885000	everything like one at a time.
7885000	7889000	60% we're getting down to the 50s.
7889000	7893000	The 90s.
7893000	7897000	A mountain pokori! Does it mention their Scottish?
7897000	7901000	Their song is actually a saying that they are fully fledged mountain
7901000	7905000	minish now. Oh. Ting, ting, ting along.
7905000	7909000	Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. What are we at? We're at 59.
7909000	7913000	Oh, we're at 59. We're getting there.
7913000	7917000	You can choose.
7917000	7921000	You can have, close whatever colour you want as long as it's green basically.
7921000	7925000	You have to choose the buff to win. You already helped him twice.
7925000	7929000	I know but doesn't he not end up with like six pals or something at one point?
7929000	7933000	I basically need to dig in all the mobiles and then trade
7933000	7937000	a Kinstone with the walls. I'm like 100% sure that's how
7937000	7941000	we got his first buddy. I just got you so
7941000	7945000	don't do that again. This is why we don't catch her.
7945000	7949000	Get your phone, get your phone. How many would you like to see?
7949000	7953000	How many would you like to see? Wager one.
7953000	7957000	Does Scotland have mountains? Yeah, we have Ben Nevis.
7957000	7961000	It is the highest mountain and a young woman
7961000	7965000	tends to her cuckoos. If you help her, gather, she'll give you
7965000	7969000	a reward. Yes, she will give money.
7969000	7973000	Yes, there is a mountain called Ben Nevis
7973000	7977000	in Scotland and people climb it. I don't think
7977000	7981000	it is definitely not severe. Don't you think it's Mount Everest or anything like that?
7981000	7985000	It's definitely not severe. But Scotland's very hilly.
7985000	7989000	Wheaton and pitta. The couple baked bread and high roll.
7989000	7993000	Their tasty pastries hold a secret. If you're extra lucky, they'll be a helpful item inside.
7993000	7997000	I like that.
7999000	8003000	Poor Goron having to rely on wishes to get some
8003000	8007000	pals. Oh no! Oh!
8007000	8011000	The Vealur account finally tweeted out all our mascots and I could see everyone
8011000	8015000	together. Did you know Snowberry's mascots are actually the
8015000	8019000	tallest and biggest out of us all? Out of the
8019000	8023000	reflames, the snippets, etc. I think it goes
8023000	8027000	um
8027000	8031000	Who's the smallest? I think Pin Pals. Then
8031000	8035000	the... Oh no!
8035000	8039000	Hold on. Herum,
8039000	8043000	Pin Pals, reflames, snippets,
8043000	8047000	bleeding hearts, and
8047000	8051000	Snowberries in size. So we... Snowberries are the
8051000	8055000	biggest out of us all. They're big boy.
8055000	8059000	No, reflames aren't the smallest. There was a
8059000	8063000	height chart created. I'll need to ask the
8063000	8067000	freaking concept artist. Um, because
8067000	8071000	Emmy, some of you caught it, but
8071000	8075000	Emmy's loading screen on her background music was the
8075000	8079000	mascot that was concepted, but she made her
8079000	8083000	Pin Pals the way they look now. So I had to get an updated loading screen
8083000	8087000	and all that like very quickly. But her background
8087000	8091000	music, it was too late. We didn't have time
8091000	8095000	to alter it because we had those assets. There was
8095000	8099000	a miscommunication with the asset maker
8099000	8103000	Yumi. Yumi's fantastic by the way. I absolutely loved working with her.
8103000	8107000	But there was a miscommunication. I was like, hey, the deadline's
8107000	8111000	May 1st. And she thought the deadline was June 1st
8111000	8115000	and I'm like, no, that was the debut date and it caused
8115000	8119000	a bit of a back walk. Um, but we actually had
8119000	8123000	that issue. I had that issue with a lot of artists who were making assets.
8123000	8127000	Ball and Chain Soldier, whatever you CBT your way off the map because
8127000	8131000	they didn't want to see you again. I had a lot of issues when
8131000	8135000	the debut date was announced
8135000	8139000	to be June 1st.
8139000	8143000	All artists either saw
8143000	8147000	that and went, oh, I can take my time with my work.
8147000	8151000	And it was like, no, I'm still asking
8151000	8155000	for you to do it by the deadline I gave you, which was more than fair.
8155000	8159000	But everyone unanimously. So if you're an artist that worked with us and you're listening
8159000	8163000	right now, don't feel bad because everyone fricking did it.
8163000	8167000	And everything backlogged to May.
8167000	8171000	My birthday was actually supposed to be when I was making shorts for everyone
8171000	8175000	and that didn't happen. I was also supposed to pre-make
8175000	8179000	all my like, thank you ASMRs, that didn't happen.
8179000	8183000	Because everything got clogged into me.
8183000	8187000	So it was a fricking developmental nightmare. My mother's birthday.
8187000	8191000	Yeah, June 1st.
8191000	8195000	My birthday now, get wrecked. I don't know.
8195000	8199000	You know, in the last dungeon, honestly. Your deadline is like, do not force me to move.
8199000	8203000	Yes, I was not budging on debut.
8203000	8207000	I'm sorry. I was not delaying any further.
8207000	8211000	Man, miss the reflins, okay? I needed to be
8211000	8215000	at my reflins the rose.
8225000	8229000	Sorry.
8255000	8259000	Sorry, I can't, I can't
8259000	8263000	say what I'm doing right now.
8277000	8281000	Wait, back to Gambo.
8281000	8285000	It's spain, everything's spain.
8285000	8289000	Everything's spain.
8289000	8293000	Everything is spain.
8293000	8297000	Everything's cool when you're part of the team.
8297000	8301000	You're almost at 8k, I bloody hope not.
8301000	8305000	I was like, I'll be able to get the clap
8305000	8309000	and ASMR out right now.

8376560	8378560	Stony would be the killest boss ever
8379280	8385000	No, I know how I'm feeling right now. I'd be a terrible boss then
8385120	8387120	I
8391240	8392840	Yes
8392840	8394960	right 51% on the
8396880	8403240	percentage over Gacha, please do not gamble. Yes, I am going to try and
8415000	8417000	I
8445000	8447000	I
8470960	8474600	Was extinct steamed from stand

8489200	8496160	Fall guys if you want to join them live you most certainly can we are gacha pointing until 50% which we are at so I can go make a honey tea
8497680	8501860	We have been released from our percentage
8505120	8509320	Wonder I wonder how low we can actually how low can you wait?
8509320	8515520	So does that mean we have 50 gacha now? We're like over halfway there. Oh, yeah, the probability is 49% now
8516080	8521600	Wait, so this is terrible to gamble below the rate. This is all gonna be repeats. Is it not now?
8521600	8524120	Yeah, I was gonna say now that we're below 50%
8525960	8531960	We have to do well, we're gonna be rich on rupees we have 125 rupees. Sorry my hair's in the way
8531960	8533960	You can't see it
8534200	8538760	Great, I pull that lever. Well, if only you could do it automatically. I wish I could feed it in like a
8539960	8541960	Is it it's called a pachinko machine?
8543120	8545120	and
8545120	8546960	I wish I could do it
8546960	8550360	Still statistically better than one all in
8551720	8553720	They aren't even plain been
8554720	8557280	They've been waiting for people for like 20 minutes
8557280	8564200	As if there's not enough stream snappers to play as if
8564200	8590040	Yes, we already had that we've gonna go on a hundred and thirty rupees long
8591040	8596800	They were late to tell people they could join so now others have to download the game. Oops
8598480	8604680	Chat to scare to play with the veal or girls. I was gonna say you guys are too scared to go against two mills
8604680	8606680	What's going on here?
8607120	8609720	Hey, you should you quaking in your little boots, huh?
8610520	8615320	Hey, little ball sack trembling at the thought of the the superiority that they have over you
8615520	8618040	Come on now. Don't be scared of them
8620040	8623240	Yeah, I don't have it installed. Why do you get a lot of replants?
8623240	8629960	How have you not got that game installed? No fool will appears in dungeons the clinical walls normal tax may not work for the boomerangs
8629960	8634600	It's pretty effective and they spawn in a fairy. No, I'm literally downloading as we speak, but internet
8635240	8640480	Or is the internet absolutely wrecking and decking. It's trembling, but that's no way
8641160	8644600	How many likes did my cheeky voice click? Yeah, I'm allowed to ask
8645560	8650120	I was embarrassed by like, oh my god, how many people have interacted with that?
8651400	8658600	I was actually someone drew me caught up in rope and I was gonna like rate my little cringy paragraph
8658600	8660600	But I want to do something slightly different
8662440	8668680	This time around and I might be able to have time to do it after this stream if I don't go too crazy
8669440	8671440	I'm still getting home from work
8671440	8673440	Oh, yeah
8673520	8675520	You can't play with the moves
8676240	8678560	Wait, does fall guys have cross play with console?
8679520	8681520	um
8682400	8684400	700 lights. Oh my god
8686240	8688240	Reflint stop
8690720	8693760	Yeah, the shabari picture. Yeah, so it's gonna do a cringe thing. That's it
8694480	8696480	Wow
8698000	8704800	Right, we need to actually get all of these in order to get that last heart. So I think we're committing
8706000	8709520	We might be committing here and like running our bank dry
8710800	8716960	Now I know I can increase the odds by increasing the shells, but we're gonna run out of shells long before that
8718160	8720160	um
8720160	8726960	Fall guys supports cross play. Okay. Well, there you go. If you've got a console apparently you can do a cheeky stream
8750960	8752960	Okay
8757200	8759200	Yes, I already have that figurine unfortunately
8760080	8762080	If I got a figurine
8762160	8764160	Would you guys halt glue it for me?
8766480	8771040	I don't know why people find it disgusting actually find it pretty good. I really don't mind it
8773200	8777440	If I had a wee Willy winky, I'd ink all the way your staff, but all you'll spill it
8778240	8780400	Yes. Yes. Okay. It feels good, man
8782400	8786720	Oh, sorry. I'm just putting a laser beam off in your freaking shop. Do excuse me
8790320	8792240	I mean there's already the acrylic
8793040	8795040	I ordered the kitchen
8795840	8799840	And I was so excited for them to arrive and then I could show my hands again
8800880	8802880	Well, just in an ASMR video
8802960	8807920	Unfortunately my french tip is starting to grow out so it doesn't look very nice
8808720	8811280	Um, but that's not gonna stop me
8812960	8816720	Uh, if if it looks I don't know how to take off gel because
8817280	8823200	Someone said that if you try to take gel off at home, you create like mustard gas in your own freaking hoost or something like that
8826240	8828240	Um
8833120	8835120	Um
8841840	8843840	Wizard robes get in my face
8844000	8846000	Yeah, that stuff does not come off nicely with home put
8846000	8850480	Yeah, like I don't want to go back to the well, obviously I can't because I'm a freaking tool
8850560	8856240	but um, I was literally just gonna let it all grow off and like cut my nails as
8856800	8861040	Like it got like too long. I assume I can cut it without like creating mustard gas
8861600	8864240	Or is it gonna be too hard to cut?
8865760	8869120	Actually that reminds me. I need to make uh your tap in ASMR
8869760	8871760	um
8873760	8880640	Because when you have like hard acrylic nails the ASMR comes out so much better. Yeah, it costs fine. Okay, that's fine
8881200	8887120	Don't make this bleed to our money. Oh, that's mustard gas. Yeah. You have to wait from a growing up. Yeah, that's fine. I don't I don't mind that
8887280	8889280	Oh
8890480	8896400	All of these self-transformants have the fighting tournament at the PCORI festival for they are the great potential
8896640	8898640	Oh, they see great potential in blink
8899440	8903360	Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, so we've not even met all of the masters yet
8907200	8914080	Okay, how many have we gone through we've not even gone through a hundred pools yet. Jeez
8914880	8916880	Um
8917120	8919620	Stroney, I will literally do anything you ask. Oh
8929280	8933120	Yes, I am waiting for the key chains and then I can do like uh
8933760	8935680	Maybe just be like a regular ASMR video
8935680	8940480	But I'll just tap on everything and start like tapping on the girls faces and their wee key chains and that
8941120	8943680	I think I'm so cute. It's a coin name
8944720	8951680	And I'll be like this is this is in me and this is a zero and this is a circle and this is sheepsters
8952800	8954800	um
8954880	8960480	I've probably said it but I gave the girls nicknames long before they had glee rock
8961120	8967120	Appears in the cavern of flames a glee rock has a hard rocky shale and mount carino hating and lava
8967520	8971440	I thoroughly enjoyed him as a boss. I think that was a really good boss
8971760	8977440	Didn't enjoy the jumpy jumpy boss ear tempo. That was not really for me to be honest
8979520	8982240	Well, I'm to stop and after 50 percent. I'm addicted
8983200	8986080	I lose 100 percent of the gacha. I don't pool
8987280	8994320	See even though we're now at 180 coins. I started at like less than 100 for the duplication
8994880	8999040	Same I will do many many things to make Johnny
9000800	9003920	You you being happy makes me happy. I don't need nothing else
9004960	9006960	Other than a smile on your goofy face
9007840	9014160	Maybe maybe if I'm really really well behaved. I might even get a giggle out. Yeah a little hee hee
9018160	9020160	Happiness feedback. Oh, yeah
9024800	9026800	Oh
9028320	9031600	Minish Vati before he became a sorcerer
9031600	9035920	He was a simple minish. He had always been entranced by the evil that lives in the hearts of men
9036720	9042800	There's not evil in the hearts of men must catch a gambler stop before winning big literally be with the next one
9043600	9045760	Shawnee does your model have any pierce things?
9046480	9049600	My model doesn't have the pierce things. Um
9050400	9055280	Originally my bikini toggle was actually gonna have indents to show
9055840	9057440	I I'm
9057440	9059440	to show the pierce things
9059840	9061520	but um
9061520	9067040	It got there was a few there was a few development on the show. So it's like such a small detail that it doesn't matter
9067760	9068880	Um
9068880	9070880	Do you have any pierce things? I did
9071760	9073760	I don't have any facial pierce things
9074400	9076400	I don't have any ear pierce things
9077360	9079360	The rest is up to you
9084160	9089680	Oh god, we're at 41 percent. This is getting bitey. Only the fun one
9092480	9094320	Um, oh
9094320	9100400	A mayfly the great mayfly fairy on mount crannel. She provides you a larger bomb bag. Oh wait, so I have seen her
9100800	9107680	So I've not seen the green fly fairy wherever a dragon fly fairy. Sorry green flies
9109520	9111520	A belly no
9111520	9115840	I see was actually supposed to have a belly piercing in her development art
9116480	9119920	You'll see it. If you didn't see the exposed room. She's doing a short about it
9121040	9122880	You know for 40 percent
9122880	9127600	Catch a chance. We're winning pretty big right now. Hold on. We're on a good streak. Let's not forget
9128240	9131760	I forgot we're going to play this game. I'm like, don't worry. Don't worry
9131920	9137440	Um, we are at the stage before everything goes to our chaos
9138000	9140000	So an armpit piercing
9142960	9149920	Um, we are currently just gacha pawning out the wazoo because apparently we need all 100 percent gachas
9150480	9154960	A in order to get access to a heart that we'll need so we can have full life
9155920	9162160	Every gacha pill layer with cell is a little cap a strange creature that looks at first like a cap
9162240	9166400	He speaks roughly and treats link like a child, but he actually really likes link. Oh
9170240	9177440	Bum piercing got it. Why some surprise? I don't know. I've never heard of an armpit piercing. Oh 37 percent as rough
9179760	9183600	40 percent is nearly 50 50 totally worth it. Spoken like a true gamble
9184560	9186560	Spoken like a true gamble
9188240	9194240	A bunny. No, my bunny is not pierced. I absolutely would not have anything near it
9194720	9199680	I do not have a a slight comprehension of the
9200800	9202320	desirability
9202320	9204080	to
9204080	9204960	Oh
9204960	9206400	No
9206400	9211600	A bunny. Absolutely not. Are you joking? Why are we talking about piercings?
9212400	9216000	Because I may or may not have some piercings. Do you want to hear it? Oh, hold on
9216080	9219280	I think you may be able to hear it if I mute the in-game audio
9221600	9223600	Hold on
9225920	9227920	You may be able to hear this
9230320	9233200	Do you hear that from a little nail against it?
9237200	9239200	There you go that one's for you
9239200	9241200	Ah
9241440	9245520	Tapping it. Oh, should I do tapping ASMR?
9246560	9249600	Piercing tapping ASMR. Would you guys be done for that?
9250960	9252960	That would actually be kind of hilarious
9253600	9261360	Well, let's pray obvious then and you trigger on lot. Oh, yes. Oh my god, right. I'll record that because that's hilarious
9262640	9265840	Piercing tapping ASMR, wink, wink, nudge, nudge
9266640	9268320	Yes
9268320	9271440	Did you just? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I did
9273760	9279840	Oh, I know our gacha nightmares. We're now at 200 rupees. He we're actually starting to really run into it
9280240	9283440	Can we tap it for you in the ASMR?
9284640	9286640	Great. Now pull that lever. I'm pulling it
9287840	9292320	New unlocked someone is wearing only a hoodie again. No
9293840	9295840	Maybe
9296080	9303760	Yeah, like I had I had a good time yesterday. I do not deserve to wear a bra right now a bra
9306720	9308720	So
9309440	9313600	I've been wanting you to make piercing taps. That's funny
9314560	9317680	Well, you got your wish because I can make it super easily
9318000	9322960	I need to make the tummy rumble in ASMR as well ASMR lying on your girlfriend's stomach, but it won't
9322960	9324960	I
9325200	9330800	That'll probably be my next like meme ASMR. I'm not really sure it's a thank you ASMR. I think it's a more of a meme ASMR
9331600	9335600	Only wearing a hoodie nothing else. Yeah, I don't even I don't even have socks on
9339520	9341520	Heartbeat ASMR when you want to hear my heartbeat
9341840	9342960	It's not very relaxing
9342960	9346800	But honestly, do you want me to talk during it or do you just want like breathing?
9347520	9353920	And heartbeat because of where the mic is placed you can hear like what I breathe and in the other ear quite well when it's against me
9355600	9359120	It's not going good. It's not going well. We're getting absolutely rigged
9361040	9363040	I think I asked for taps on the last day
9363760	9369120	Socks are the tool of Satan. I honestly don't mind socks because it kind of contains the sweat
9370560	9374960	Out of curiosity is a picture. I'm going to be audios or will the rest of the stuff
9375360	9378960	Or when or will you and the rest of the girls we do and other stuff?
9379440	9382720	Um, definitely like early access to meme stuff is
9383280	9387280	Like for me early access or like youtube archive to my audios perfectly fine
9388080	9392960	Um, as for other stuff. No, it's like audio based content
9394480	9396480	Talking to please and we talk
9397280	9399280	Oh, no
9399280	9403280	Yeah, I'm feeling this percentage probability debuff. This is getting rough
9405200	9408400	They're one in three now. We're at one in three
9410320	9412880	With how hot it is over by me me we're in
9413600	9418320	Even we're in a hoodie. That's worth. Okay. We got it. We got it one in three one in three
9419520	9425360	Cry at ranting during the heartbeat ranting about what came what see this catcher game and legend is elder
9425360	9432400	Yeah, freaking probability dropping down to the floor. I bet you probably the probability will be one by the time we're done with it
9435040	9436560	and
9436560	9438560	The wind tried
9439360	9441360	The wind sure
9442400	9444880	Renting about whatever conspiracies on your mind that day
9450400	9453920	Oh, I have a really controversial one but might filter people
9454560	9458320	But then it means more of the tight-knit community. Maybe it's win-win
9458480	9460480	I
9460880	9464240	Strongly be movie script when absolutely not I have no desire for that
9464640	9468720	I've seen that meme done a few times as well, but if the meme's been done before I might
9470320	9471600	Whereas like
9471600	9476320	I I don't want to say anything but I have to admit I've never looked up clapping without
9476720	9480640	Clapping ASMR, but without my hands before like I think that's funny as heck, you know
9481520	9484000	And then again, it's probably already made and it's sitting on youtube
9484960	9488880	Shawnee always does the filter and yeah, I do it myself. Don't worry. We demand the filter
9489760	9492320	Okay, so you know how there's been abortion bans
9493280	9496960	It's absolutely nothing to do about religion or anything or any of that crap
9497360	9499920	A mold worm appears in minish roads
9499920	9503760	They come out of the ground when they sense free if you get swallowed you'll take damage get all dirty
9504000	9506000	Watch out because when you're dirty
9506480	9508480	I've never seen that enemy
9508800	9509920	and
9509920	9512000	It's about like it's about
9512640	9516720	Raising the population because the population is crashing right now
9517040	9522400	And what happens when a population crashes? Oh, you can't have infinite growth
9524080	9528240	No infinite growth for you capitalist cogs. No, no, no, no
9529040	9534880	Um, so that's why bond reception and abortions are being outlawed because we need slaves
9535120	9536800	We need poor
9536800	9540400	Because you know who benefits from abortions and all that stuff
9540640	9547200	People who are not in a position financially and responsibly to raise children. That's who benefits from that really
9548000	9549520	and
9549520	9551520	Embryo and all that
9552160	9554160	So yeah, um
9554160	9556960	We need more cogs in the capitalist machine
9557440	9558320	so
9558320	9560320	Yeah, again, capital is interesting
9560800	9564160	because yeah, um because of the nature of
9564160	9570240	Of um development as well. So if you think two generations back your grandparents will say
9570640	9574880	I had seven brothers and sisters and then your mum and dad
9575200	9579520	They had three brothers and sisters and then your mum and dad had
9580160	9583920	I produced you solo because at the rate of success
9584320	9588160	You don't need to farm all these children popping out at you willy-nilly
9588400	9592240	So the population is heading for a crash landing
9592640	9594640	fair
9594640	9596640	Uh ace more running about capitalism
9599280	9603840	Me mum's the youngest of 11. How many are you gonna have those the question?
9604560	9606000	because
9606000	9611440	Statistically it goes big party a big party big family medium family
9612000	9618000	Uh, and we're we're heading to one to zero territory. Actually. No, we're already in zero territory
9618240	9624000	Isn't south korea zero point four for the replacement rate for every two couple
9624720	9629200	Wait, zero point four. Yeah for every two couples. There's one child
9630080	9632080	Does that make sense?
9633920	9637680	One they're gonna be a popper. Yes, exactly. Um
9638800	9642400	Depends on how many you want. Oh me how many I want
9642480	9644480	And
9644800	9646000	Um
9646000	9651280	South korea is at zero point seven. Okay, and I think it went down. Yeah
9652640	9658880	This is the uncap rhetoric I membership for yeah, I don't even know what uncap is but thank you
9658960	9662320	Oh any capitalism report. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here
9664240	9666240	Um
9666640	9670080	We'll be having plenty of kids on the farm. No, you're my kid
9671040	9672720	Is that weird
9672720	9674720	You're the father. What?
9675360	9679120	Oh, I jumped. I was like wait link and jump. Yes link has a cape
9679840	9681360	um
9681360	9683360	Do you even want children? Yeah
9684480	9691760	With a boisterous crowd and a cute crest these feathered friends are the most popular pets in high rule. The baby chicks are like small boos
9693120	9695840	Uh, anarchy. Oh an arachnid
9696800	9698800	Oh, you're teaching me phrases. I don't even
9700080	9704080	No, you are my children and I'm also pregnant with you and you're the father
9706160	9710400	Uh, I'm still not commissioned that artwork. Yeah, I need to hurry up and do it so I can make it because it's hilarious
9711920	9713920	Ah
9714720	9717920	What's your name gammy gammy gammy atlas blossom
9718560	9720560	Nice to see you to see you nice
9721520	9723520	Sweet home
9723600	9725600	Boy girl both how many
9725760	9728960	Uh, wherever the reeflings are that's how many
9730960	9733120	Whatever number we've got we've gained, you know
9735360	9737360	Wow, I've already had that
9738320	9740320	We're now at 270 coins
9741520	9745360	8 000 reeflings. That's a lot of birthing. I'm gonna be honest
9746880	9749920	Birth throws are winning right now. They are absolutely winning
9751680	9753680	Jen
9754640	9756640	Uh, I'd rather raise a dog
9756720	9761440	To be a grandpa of its pup since I love dogs cats. I'm allergic to rip being allergic to cat
9762080	9764080	I got two precious poodles
9765040	9767040	I don't think I'm getting any more putters on
9770160	9772400	So many questions about that
9773200	9774400	What about
9774400	9779920	About me being prego with you, but you're also the dad at the same time. Like don't think about it too much
9779920	9781920	It's like a little warp
9782240	9787360	Um, because like if you Azura's lore is that she's actually your literal mummy
9788240	9793920	She creates civilization which makes her your mom technically and all technicality
9794720	9796720	Uh, but I birthed
9797760	9799760	Azura technically
9801120	9805840	Oh, we got a new one our percentage is now less than one in three
9807120	9809760	It's less than 33 percent. So it's less than one in three
9810720	9812720	One in three to the infinite
9814000	9816720	It makes perfect sense to me. Okay. Well, I'm glad it does because
9817840	9819840	Prego strongy was off
9821440	9823440	Yeah
9823600	9825920	Do you want to try some cuttlefish milk?
9827840	9832000	You just have to do you have to do something first to make the cuttlefish milk come in though
9832880	9834880	Oh
9835680	9841600	Young couple Romeo. Oh raw mayo and julietta grew up next door. They're dating now
9841600	9845760	But they plan to marry once they get their pets approval. Then you go talk to their dog
9848080	9850080	Yes, god, please
9851280	9854240	I wish to do that. Maybe I'll get some fun out of that
9855360	9857280	um
9857280	9861040	Like what milton tin I got a beefling diet through
9861760	9867920	How would that even work? Would you have to get the piercing though? No, um, if you didn't know
9868720	9870720	boobly mooblies, um
9871840	9874800	It's not like one singular flow of
9876560	9879920	Milk, um, it's like little tiny
9880880	9882880	multiple little things
9883600	9887200	Um, so the piercings do not have to be removed for that
9888640	9890640	Just means you have to suck a bit harder
9891920	9893920	Oh
9895120	9904080	Refreshing treat udders udders. Can he call it udders? That's that's rough calling it udders
9906640	9908640	We'll have to get a zero to demonstrate
9909920	9912240	Done for that. We have a deal
9913040	9918160	Okay, I think I'm gonna have to put the heat in on and get a cup of tea because it's frozen
9918720	9925760	Nothing nothing. Uh, apparently Aussie houses have like the worst insulation ever
9925840	9927840	There's like nay insulation to them at all
9928560	9931680	I believe it because I've rented
9932880	9936160	And uh, it's absolute piss, so I'm gonna need for the heat on
9937440	9939440	Are you saying you want us?
9940000	9942000	Exactly
9942080	9945600	Oh, oh, they're called chuchu. That's such a good name

10721200	10722640	Rolly legend
10722640	10725280	I really struggled to say your name to two L's on it
10725920	10729520	And my brain always recessed on us that I'm saying to me. Hi Gimli. Yeah
10730400	10736480	I've got you only have one cat. No, I have two putters. I have baby boy and my little princess. Gimli is my princess
10737120	10741520	and baby boy is my little munchkin cat that I
10742800	10745520	The universe sent to me as a laugh
10745920	10747920	and
10748160	10750160	I am a big
10750640	10754160	believer in not breeding cat breeds that are detrimental to their health
10754720	10759760	And then the universe said here take this boy and I was like right fine. I will take this boy
10760960	10763120	Um, and I love them to pieces
10764320	10768080	He's a very silly cat though because he hurt himself and I had to take him to the vet
10769040	10771040	Which was not a fun experience
10771920	10776000	Uh, because cats were really dumb and don't show any pain
10776800	10780000	Uh, and I just it was petting him and his like
10780720	10784000	Blood had matted his fur on his back leg and I was like, what did you do?
10784800	10788960	And then I managed to cut it away and he had a big nasty gash on his leg
10789360	10791360	but um, he healed up nicely
10791760	10793760	and and
10794160	10799360	I was having to warn the vets because I was like, I'm so sorry, but like I've only just got him
10799520	10803520	I have no idea what his temperament is with vets like if he's aggressive or not
10803520	10809040	So please be careful and they were like he was the sweetest boy we've had all day and I'm like
10809280	10813600	Shucks, you just say that to everyone, don't you? You've got me blushing about my baby boy
10814800	10816640	Um, but I'm so sorry
10818000	10820640	But I'm gonna be eating with my in my hands. Okay
10824000	10826640	I'll try and eat that because I should be lucky
10830000	10832000	Oh
10846640	10849440	I have to take your time trying to heal it
10850160	10852160	Oh
10855040	10861120	It's not toast it's chicken lettuce onion on like a flatbread
10866560	10871040	Are you gonna be a cat lady? No, I'm gonna be a farm lady wearing milk reeflings all day long
10872000	10874000	Mmm
10874960	10879920	Oh, I'll tell you something actually about psychology. Do you know
10881520	10888160	Why is unattractive to women if you don't like animals? I'll see if someone can guess why
10890960	10898960	Um, but why do you think that women do not like it if men say they do not like animals
10901360	10905040	Because then you can't care for them
10905840	10911440	Shows a lack of empathy. Oh you're getting close indicates. You don't want children. You're getting there
10912480	10914000	so
10914000	10917600	This is absolutely outrageous to say but it is what it is. Um
10918720	10923200	Psychology wise animals are viewed as lesser, aren't they?
10924800	10927520	Some men view women as lesser
10928080	10931840	So if man don't like animal, what does man think about women?
10933200	10934720	Hmm
10934720	10937760	Scary beans and that is why women naturally do not like men
10938320	10945280	Or gravitate to words men that do not like animals if you do not like animals. I'm so sorry, but psychologically it's a big old, uh
10946240	10948240	Monkey
10948800	10950800	Mm-hmm
10956240	10959600	I love animals, but not women. Why the fuck are you what?
10963360	10968000	Do I see or am I just one of the bros be honest or am I like the neighbor next door come on
10969200	10971200	Show me the goods show me the goods
10972160	10980720	Um, I have some terrible news to break to you about what I've got going on downstairs if you don't like women
10983120	10986480	I'm literally I'm literally the guy that doesn't want animals in their house
10988880	10992640	That's currently petting his dog while getting thinking about getting a second. Yeah
10994080	10997920	That's like the most adorable thing my dad was like that with cats is like no
10997920	11001760	We're not getting another cat and then there would be some sob story
11002720	11006880	Our stray would show up. I think we've had three strays show up
11009040	11011040	Um and I don't
11012960	11018240	You're one of the bros for me. Honestly. All right grip grip session boys. Let's do a soggy biscuit. Well, what about it?
11022880	11024880	Wait a minute you're a woman
11025680	11030480	My little baby saved me from being forever little pudders
11032560	11038080	Can't have animals. I'm allergic. Oh, that's a shame. There's some hypoallergenic freaks, I think
11042880	11044880	But I'm a woman
11045600	11047600	Oh
11050560	11053040	I love animals, but I'm terrible at taking care of them. Yeah
11054240	11055760	I'm I'm
11055760	11058640	I love my pudders so much. They're they're just perfection
11059120	11062240	But you have to treat me like an animal. You need to take me on a walk and stuff
11063120	11065120	You know
11070720	11072720	You're opening a pen
11075840	11082480	Are the animals in a box in a dark room whilst you're pressed against the box by any chance
11090000	11094480	I thought it was the other way around. Oh, no, no, no, no the leash and the collar goes both ways
11095120	11098720	For once it's a not on me, but on you
11099520	11101520	No
11103200	11111280	Remove my dinkleberries, I assure you there's no a liquor here anywhere from below my head, I guess
11116000	11118160	You need to go nap your tire left
11121280	11127600	Strony walks up with the collar and leash time for walkies literally walk me like a dog at the convention
11129280	11131280	You
11131760	11139600	At least connects our collars together. I don't think we're coordinated enough to walk side by side on our hands and knees, are we?
11142000	11144000	You can take me on a walk anytime
11149680	11151680	I always say
11152400	11154400	I'm
11156080	11159680	Shorting on the farm with a key leashes out on a walk on
11181680	11183680	I
11189600	11193760	Have almost finished the omelette right there one last day. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to heal
11197360	11202560	You talk to the guy behind you when you get all the figures. Oh, that's very lucky
11203360	11205360	I'll take that
11211040	11216240	Elton ring Joe between straw and reef and spender who walks who wait
11217840	11219840	But either way isn't a punishment
11220800	11222640	We're losing
11222640	11226960	Either way, I win you don't understand I win you lose

12792800	12796640	There's a reason tingle calls you a fairy that can't remember. I must be related to other war
12797680	12801120	Hey, we're going to do a complete backtrack of the woods right now
12802080	12804720	Okay, maybe this is the bean
12810800	12815600	Yes, it is the bean. Okay, we can literally go straight back to where we just passed. That's perfect
12817280	12822160	They call you a fairy because you're also green. You guys are you guys aren't afraid of heights, right?
12823040	12825040	You don't be shy
12825040	12828240	Let me just double check. He's not gonna give me a second one
12828400	12832800	Yeah, listen, you remember the bean I posted? Yeah, I do. I saw it cool
12833680	12838960	Tingle calls you a fairy because anyone he thinks in green is a fairy because he thinks that's cute
12839760	12841760	You look like me. You are me
12842480	12844240	Right, time to claim
12844240	12846240	Let's see what's up here
12846800	12850320	Okay, that's a bit dramatic. I have to admit that's a bit much
12851440	12853920	Well, there's a heart up here. So I'll take it
12854720	12860800	I need I've got three. I've got 200 rupees. I think I'm gonna max out on rupees. I might buy shells in that case
12864720	12871120	If we're gonna backtrack should I just 100 guarantee gamba these figures if we're gonna backtrack
12871200	12874640	I think we're gonna end up with like tons of shells
12875360	12880080	Yeah, I've like wasted a hundred shells with that. We're just gonna do guaranteed pulls
12881040	12885280	I shouldn't but if we're gonna backtrack we 100% are gonna get like
12886400	12889920	Tons of shells and that was such a waste. Ah, that was such a waste
12891680	12896480	Okay, right. Let's see. You want me to do what your back? Yes. I am back. I'm addicted
12897600	12900320	How many do I need for 100 probability?
12903760	12908640	I'm just gonna do 100 probability because I don't want to gamble like 60 and then not get it
12910800	12913680	Let's do 100. Let's do 100. What is it drum roll?
12916160	12921760	Fire wizard money gang. I burped when I said that. I don't know if you heard that or the mic may have covered it up
12923200	12924480	Okay
12924480	12928640	Is there a faster way to do this? No, it's not. I literally have to go all the way up manually
12929520	12931520	Big gamba time big gamba
12932160	12934160	We're gonna do good
12935120	12936720	Okay
12936720	12940480	74 so I think we get like six pulls and then we're done
12941920	12947760	No burp on the mic. No, I did it as I was talking. So I don't know if the mic even heard it
12949040	12956080	One for each percent and yeah, the uh, this is rough. So I'm only gonna get like 10 gacha
12956880	12958880	new from it
12959440	12961440	I
12963040	12965040	Now pull that lever I
12966560	12973280	What do the figures do in the game it unlocks a location that we need in order to get 100 percent
12973840	12976560	So unfortunately, we're kind of stuck doing this right now
12976880	12984480	Um, but we are just gonna get rid of our shells because we're about to backtrack and we'll be rewarded with new
12985440	12992800	Um, oh was that 99? I swear if that was 99 and we don't get it
12996800	12998800	Okay
13002960	13008960	It's too easy it's too easy ladies and gentlemen, you're lucky I refrained
13011040	13013040	You're so lucky I refrained
13015440	13018720	I I have so much ability to hold it in okay
13020640	13022640	All right, let's see
13022800	13024800	In that room is the music play
13025360	13029200	Let's play in game music. I believe in that room is the music player
13032240	13036960	Yeah, we haven't got I don't actually ever recall getting it before you know that
13040000	13042000	And
13042560	13047760	Oh, you're charging me bro, you are charging me
13049920	13051920	77 just for a guarantee
13056000	13060240	Happy hearth in oh my god, that's such a lovely name for an in
13061600	13064560	I wouldn't mind. Oh my god. Maybe we should develop an in game
13065600	13069040	I quite like meta games. I'm really impressed with that. Um
13070000	13074800	What's the name the team that put together needy streamer overload. I am so impressed
13074880	13079600	I really want to look into them and see to produce anything else. I was blown away by that
13080320	13083520	Uh, what game did I really enjoy that? Um
13086640	13088640	Um that double shitty game
13089760	13093760	Oh, I can't I remember it with the nightclub and I had terrible luck on it buckshot relay
13093840	13097680	I was very impressed with buckshot relay. I definitely want to look into the dev team
13098400	13103120	Although I think it was made by one guy actually, so it'd be interesting to see what other games he came up with
13103840	13105840	Um
13106960	13108960	I'm out of shells yet
13112320	13117120	Buckshot's just one guy literally need see if he's got anything else on the market though like, um
13118480	13122240	Definitely put my money where my mouth is type thing like, um
13123200	13125200	The more shells you use yes this thing
13125840	13128480	Am I out yet? No. No, I can still get more
13129600	13134880	Wow, you lose a hundred percent the same. So this is teaching us go big or go home
13136400	13139920	I'm addicted to buckshot after watching I did so bad
13140640	13143920	But it was funny though stamp a busy hard-working employee
13144000	13149040	Although he can be a touch edgy the stamp he uses his own personal ones. Please don't borrow it. Thanks
13149760	13153440	I love like the little details like you didn't have to come up with that lore
13153520	13156000	But the game was like, yeah, we're gonna make random lore for these times people
13157280	13159280	Are we out shells now?
13161600	13163600	No
13164400	13166720	80 though, bro a
13168640	13175280	Any chance for another buckshot relay stream, uh, most likely a member stream if there's any games we want to revisit
13175920	13181360	Um, I'm quite happy to do it in members because if you look it might be a bit like, oh, you've already shamed this before type thing
13182480	13188800	She says she'll please Viva pinata and cameo shamelessly to back-to-back endurance rooms. Um
13190800	13197840	I think I said I got the achievements on Skyrim working again. So we can actually go back to Skyrim in
13198560	13200080	July
13200080	13201360	Um
13201360	13208400	Oh peaceful high rule car loves peaceful high rule scenery. I don't know who car love is but you've got good taste mate
13209440	13220080	Uh, you can just carry 990 max. So 10 is 11 pulls. No crashed warp 100 percent. Oh, I'm not sure I have that kind of skill
13220960	13226000	I'm not very good. I don't comprehend. It's a child's game, but I'm I don't think I'm that good
13226880	13228000	I
13228000	13232240	How does he know about the minute to make figures exactly?

14880720	14883760	As if that thing just aim bought on the arse
14886240	14888240	Oh

14953760	14959520	We don't need to anything else in here. Uh, we'll go small and navigate the map as a wee one
14962080	14968160	Uh, we'll just double check this little minish in here. Is there a minish in here?
14970080	14972080	I

14986880	14990640	Oh, but we need to make triple quadruple sure because if we win a hundred percent in the game
14990640	14992640	We need to go all the way and uh

15330800	15332800	Thank you
15333760	15338240	Okay, I think if I talk to this cow there has to be a kinstone piece because why would the game want me to come
15338240	15343040	All the way over. Oh, that was too close. I thought I'd be ground chuck for sure. Wait
15344320	15346320	Oh, I can't do anything
15348240	15354080	That's it. I'm picking up this pot and throwing out when I'm tiny. Wait, so there was a waste of I didn't need to do any of this
15355440	15358800	Oh, well. Oh, well, we tried we tried. What's this?

15410800	15412800	No, no, that's stinky
15413360	15417680	Right, if we can get more green we can go back to the original tingle
15417920	15421040	And then we've unlocked whatever that is
15421680	15429040	Because there's one more. Can I get green please? No, okay. I guess it. Oh, no. Wait, hold on. It's faster just to jump off the map

16674560	16680320	Fantasies I should actually mention. What were we doing? I think we're going mount cereal, aren't we?

16713920	16718320	Uh, right. I've already done that, so you don't need to worry about that
16723040	16728080	If that's the shortcut down, I assume I've already nuked whoever's in here
16729600	16734240	Uh, so much fun. Oh wait, I've not been in here. Did I run out? Maybe I didn't have enough bombs at the time
16734960	16740720	I'll take the money though. Fine tens. Poor things have been stuck in that cave. First thing I do is take one of their friends and leave
16741680	16749280	Uh, I'm just checking if there's anything that looks like I need to bomb at or something
16751200	16754880	Hmm, not that my elf I see. Havern

16797120	16799120	There was a cavern that I couldn't do
16800480	16805520	I thought this would work. Or is this just how I'm supposed to actually, no, it must be the other cavern. Sorry
16806720	16811920	There was a cavern that we needed to explore with an item that I didn't have yet
16812800	16817280	If I need an else this guy, oh our cults groups. Damn, shoot me off. This one
16818720	16820720	I'm pretty sure it's a cave
16821200	16823200	No
16824240	16826240	This cave?
16826880	16831040	Short cut to the bomb. So then what's this? Wasn't there no a cave like?

16881920	16885840	Believe it or not. I'm gray blade and I'm a train. Would you like to train? Yes
16886960	16891840	You will learn the roll attack roll and then as soon as you get up scream. Hiya
16893120	16895120	Yes, I understand
16896080	16898800	But one must feel the technique position

17104160	17106160	I
17106960	17108960	Banished right then
17108960	17111920	Did you teach? Oh, no, I don't teach cats that trick cats are
17112640	17113840	Uh
17113840	17115680	They don't need to be oh
17115680	17120560	I cannot believe I didn't know you could wallop those. I thought they were just like a paramount enemy
17121040	17123040	That's so silly
17124720	17129760	Uh, but no, I never taught my putters any twigs. I don't uh, I don't know they're
17130320	17132640	They're cats really performative animals
17134560	17135840	Um
17135840	17139200	I have had to teach them to let me pick them up. So
17140160	17141440	I was
17141440	17146720	Had a weird like stance of like, oh, I won't pick up my cat because they don't like it type thing
17147280	17152560	But then I realized if there was ever an emergency I need them to be able to leap into my arms
17153360	17157120	Um, thankfully no emergency is ever occurred. Well other than
17157840	17160720	Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This is exactly what we want
17162880	17166000	I'd a cat that leads play bitch. Yeah, teach me to come on. Come on
17167200	17169200	You want to teach me to do that?
17171680	17177920	There's a solid wall no doubt about it. Is this the last one we've unlocked a chest of some sort
17181600	17184160	I got a brother and a sister cat recently and there are
17184720	17189920	Uh, they are too keen on getting held. Oh, they aren't no it takes it takes a long time for a cat
17190160	17196720	If you think of it imagine something eight times your size picking you up like it's quite it's quite a lot
17197520	17199520	But over time over time
17201280	17203760	There's normally only one pair of caverns
17207040	17209040	Anything else
17209360	17211360	Oh
17212880	17214880	Yes, but you have to teach us to
17215280	17217040	H3o
17217040	17218640	H3o
17218640	17221840	H, you know H3o is technically right. Hello
17223120	17225120	I'm the hermit
17228400	17232800	Do you do anything else? No, okay. He just sits here. He's just happy to be here
17233440	17239280	Um, I think that's all we can do on the mountain because up ahead is like actual like quest and stuff
17239840	17241840	We've already seen the fairy
17244080	17246880	So I guess we'll go to the swamp already. Yeah
17251760	17253760	All right
17256960	17259440	Okay, now that we can swim
17260400	17262400	Okay, this is just a snake room
17264240	17268720	If only you were eight times my size, I'll wait until you hear about a zoo's lore
17269520	17271520	Okay, there's a little thing here
17273520	17275520	Back in the tiny
17277920	17280800	Oh, this is a vast map though
17281920	17286480	Oh a booty fly you call a joy you can now dig faster than before
17286640	17287760	Are you squid mirroring?
17287760	17289600	Curious
17289600	17292640	I am rewatching the member stream of the forbidden tail list
17293200	17299920	I didn't realize you had a gen 2 commission waiting. I already tipped on it, but here is some extra chocolate luck
17301840	17303840	Wait, what?
17304880	17312800	500 am I I need my glasses on unironically where my is that actually say 500 or are you fucking trolling right now?
17312800	17316800	Holy shit, what the fuck?
17318640	17326000	500 that are for love. Thank you. Hello. What the ink literally what the ink?
17327520	17329520	500
17331440	17333440	Um, I've kind of
17333520	17339200	I've said this before I'm happy to fucking hell 500. Thank you. Jesus
17339920	17341440	um
17341440	17343440	I have said this before
17343440	17349440	But basically we make a route a racially and this is terrible. This is the only way you can describe it
17350160	17353040	We make a racially ambiguous person and then
17353760	17358000	And then we can chocolate fire them if they're chocolate because you can't have a white chick on a chocolate
17358720	17360720	But you can have a chocolate on a white chick
17361040	17363040	Example she be chocolate
17363680	17366240	But she be she be she be's cooking
17367280	17368480	um
17368480	17371600	Holy sugar. Ah, that is a lot of money. Thank you
17373360	17376080	No, it's true. No, it's true. It's true. It's true
17377520	17381680	You can't have a white chick on a chocolate, but you can have a chocolate on a white chick, you know what I mean
17382880	17385280	Surely that makes sense. That was a sense, right?
17386720	17389280	Uh, right we need to dig under there
17391440	17394720	Wait what now? Yeah, no, it does make sense. Yeah. Yeah, okay good
17395360	17397680	I might have said it the wrong way by accident, but you know what I mean
17399440	17401440	Uh
17401920	17403920	Oh
17404880	17409280	Right, is there a box 50 I'll take it 50
17411200	17413200	We live in a society
17413920	17415920	Honestly, I don't mind like I
17416480	17422080	remember when the eyes were teased of the models and someone quote tweeted it and they were like
17422720	17425040	Oh my god, they're actually coming out with a chocolate
17426000	17428160	And like it really made me think like
17429760	17432560	Holy shit, y'all motherfuckers don't get any love, do you? Um
17434160	17440800	Because everyone's too busy being weird about it. Um, but it just wasn't even a it wasn't even a second thought like
17441200	17443200	um, so as I said
17444080	17446080	Azura was designed chocolate
17447040	17452640	But we then when it came to model production, we made her racially ambiguous
17453600	17459680	Because we didn't have a choice. Okay, we didn't have a choice. We had to make her racially ambiguous because we didn't know who was gonna get her but
17462720	17464400	Um
17464400	17468800	We could make maker chocolate. Um
17470880	17479520	Am I being trolled? I'm being trolled. Um, sorry puzzle time. Hold on. Um, and basically like not to give anything away, but um
17480240	17483840	You know, then you'd be surprised if another racially ambiguous pops up. Um
17485040	17486800	Because just
17486800	17488800	Not many designs really
17489120	17491120	Wow, what's this?
17491680	17493680	A dojo. Hello
17495120	17498480	Swordsman ship is spirit. I am the finest or
17499040	17505200	Maybe second finest swordman scar blade. Oh because he's got a scar. I like that. Thank you again for that tip
17505360	17512320	Fucking 500 that's insane. Please do not tip anymore. That is an insane amount of money. Thank you though. I really appreciate it. Um
17513840	17515840	But yes, um
17516000	17521600	Basically ambiguous slash chocolate or eating well at veiler. I assure you headquarters are
17522160	17524800	Looking after you. What am I doing spin blade?
17525360	17528960	You speed up your great spin charge. You won't have to hold the button as long anymore
17530240	17532240	Oh, what? That's so fast
17533200	17534720	Is she edible?
17534720	17538560	We need more chocolate. Well, I thought I thought you weren't so right
17538960	17543040	This is just me being dumb like surprise surprise me being dumb named better joe. Um
17544000	17546000	But I thought
17546000	17548880	That you weren't supposed to say like chocolate and all that
17549600	17554640	But then when azura came out and everyone was like chocolate chocolate. I'm like, oh wait, so
17555360	17557360	chocolate's fine to say
17557920	17559920	Because I didn't know
17559920	17561920	But now I'm like, yeah chocolate
17564080	17566080	Um
17566480	17570480	But yes, right. We've already been there. That's fine. Um
17573760	17581120	So, okay, we did unlock a few bits and bobbies here. Okay, we locked like a lot of bits and bobbies
17582560	17588640	And some people find out I thought they did too, but then everyone was like, yeah chocolate and I was like, oh, right
17588640	17592400	Okay, we're doing this right. Okay. Okay chocolate. Let's go chocolate. Yeah, chocolate feature first
17592880	17594880	Let's go like I didn't know
17595440	17600000	Um, but like, you know, I'm glad. Uh, yes, you please do not worry about
17600880	17603040	a azura being the only
17603680	17609440	Rashly ambiguous or chocolate. Um, you eat well at veal or I assure you that much
17610000	17611680	um, and
17611680	17616240	She be mere may not have something in the work smile smile. She may have something in it

17623440	17625440	That's the weirdest shit I've ever heard
17626320	17628320	Okay, let's go this way

17717920	17719920	It's kind of like saying
17720160	17723760	Need someone to be positive. Oh, she's almost died there because I was reading
17724400	17729920	It's kind of like how saying something needs to be positive and not directly. We love the hmm
17730160	17732160	I love that terminology
17734400	17736400	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
17736640	17740320	Uh, I do not want to lose health because that laser thing is

17765520	17770880	At least you have been to ask this stuff and tell people I hope yeah, like I thought it was bad, but then like

17822000	17825680	Okay, now I can't do anything else being weak. So we're gonna go back to being big
17827600	17829600	Unless I can go over this
17830880	17834000	Sure, what's over here? Let me know
17836160	17839200	Uh can't go in there. Yeah, um
17841040	17843440	Right, okay, we've done all we can being we
17856800	17861280	How do I get big again? Jeez, this is quite a trick and I have to get big
17864000	17867920	Oh boy, I better make plans for this after steam. It shouldn't be oh
17868880	17870880	It'd be very refling that
17871520	17873520	About to get showered in quality
17873680	17877760	Um, I honestly thought it's gonna be a four hour stream. We've hit the five hour mark
17877760	17881200	And we're like no the end is not in sight. I repeat the end is not in
17883440	17885440	Oh, I'm actually gonna have to
17886240	17888240	Do that fly thing
17889120	17891120	No, I can just run across the
17893600	17897360	Mate, I'm getting so turned around right now. I'm getting so turned around
17898800	17900800	Where the heck am I?
17901920	17903920	I need something to claim
17906400	17908400	We might have a three parer I'm
17912000	17914000	Moving
17916320	17920240	That's so terrible that oh see that went a little better
17924880	17926880	Wait, I've not done that one
17928720	17931440	Oh, I think I need a poke it in its eye
17942240	17945280	I wish they would perish permanently my only
17946160	17952320	My only gripe with this game is just oh and I've gone away. I don't even need to go
17953040	17955040	What happens if I jump down here? What happens? Hmm?
17955440	17957440	They're far
17957920	17960800	You will you teach me now master ugwe?
17962720	17967280	Though my body may perish swiftly the first you were trained with me. So would you like to train? Yes
17968480	17974320	This is the technique that I only have mastered only one who holds the sacred blade can perform the great spin attack first
17974320	17978160	Do a spin attack press the button repeatedly. Yes, I understand
17979120	17981920	Okay, let's go position
17982880	17988640	It's a day ending in why so strong any forces are we flings for another 12 hour endurance stream no sleep blood
17989520	17994880	I like the stories where they're like, oh I fell asleep at the start of your stream and then I got to wake up to you
17995120	17997120	And I'm like, oh
17997280	17999680	Okay, I like hurricane spin. That's so good
18000880	18003280	My wings are like a hurricane
18004000	18008880	That's a that's a hobbit with wings the smoke. No, there's nothing more. I can teach you you're on your own
18010640	18012640	So if I'll learn everything
18014880	18020240	Wait, wait a minute. Oh, no, I have to be small
18021680	18023680	No, I have to go back
18026400	18030080	I had I had to go in the sweet lily pad here to go here
18030400	18033680	Say it so
18034880	18036880	I will not oh butterfly
18036960	18042720	You can cause you caught a joy butterfly. You can now shoot arrows faster than before. Oh, I like that
18045280	18049760	There was something I was supposed to do back here and I didn't do it out of pure laziness. I'm sorry
18054560	18056560	Oh, I need to finish my teeth. I almost forget
18056640	18065040	You guys are just so interesting that you're like, I don't think I've ever had like a nice pipe and perfectly temperature tea
18068160	18071280	I actually woke up from a nap earlier go waking up to use one of the pillagers
18071360	18076800	I think yeah, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, it's actually really nice that no matter what time of day
18077280	18081040	I get the opportunity to catch you live and I'm like, damn
18081680	18083680	like that sounds like
18084000	18085440	I'm like
18085440	18087440	Addicted and like online all the time
18087680	18092800	Also, me who is like, yeah, if you two didn't have vodishes, I'd probably pull you for like 14 hours
18092960	18094960	Yeah, like stream for 14 hours. Yeah
18096160	18098160	Maybe I do have a problem
18098720	18100720	But it's a problem
18100880	18103120	If it has if it's good, you know
18103360	18105360	Yeah
18109040	18110880	Yes, having a good day. Oh, I'm having a good day
18110880	18116560	We're currently mucking about going back to see if we can pick up more hearts before we do this boss fight
18116960	18123280	We are now missing 16 pieces, which is actually still quite a decent amount in all honesty
18124320	18126000	um
18126000	18132160	Unfortunately, I'm not aware where I missed. I need to trade quite a few Kinstone like there's a few waterfalls and stuff to the
18132800	18135200	Right side of the map that I haven't unlocked. So
18138480	18144160	You start when I finish working most of the time I just get to watch almost all of the streams that's good timing
18145760	18149840	Shawnee's the best problem to have it's not a problem if we're all enjoying it
18151120	18154560	If it's ever a problem and you need to you need to make your
18155760	18160160	Your issues heard just go on my alt twitter and see if it's a problem after listening
18163040	18167200	Oh, I just realized link blinks even though you're afk
18171840	18175440	Okay, finish the tea. Let's see what I am missing
18178640	18180640	We don't need to deal with that
18181600	18183920	Is there anything hidden back there? Not that I can tell
18185120	18188640	Okay, there's quite a few bits and bulbs here. Ow. Don't do that again
18189520	18191520	Okay, there we go
18193040	18195040	200 that's fantastic
18197120	18202560	Oh get your pawn work. Oh, no, we don't have access. This is definitely a Kinstone
18205280	18207600	Oh, and there's a beanstalk as well
18209280	18212080	Oh, sorry, I didn't know I thought he was perished but he's not
18215680	18217680	No, come on
18219600	18221600	There we go
18222880	18227840	Uh, wait, don't you be small over here? Oh, wow, I do need to be small from over here
18228400	18230400	Okay, let's take a little meter
18230560	18234160	You start streaming just around the time I'm able to get to my pc after work
18234480	18239840	It's like seven company will I get to raw at my desk bro raw after work all you need to
18240240	18246000	I used to be physically mentally drained after my wee shifts at the cafe
18246960	18251440	Although working on the care homes actually probably rougher on the mental and
18252240	18255840	But my favorite thing about being a waitress was like you'd be like
18256640	18262960	I forgot the water for table seven when you're like going to bed and trying to sleep. You're like, oh, no
18264560	18269360	Um, I always like laugh at those memories. You got a piece of heart make four
18269920	18271920	Oh
18272400	18276160	I still actually I still remember I served this couple
18277360	18278800	um
18278800	18280480	and there was a few
18280480	18285360	Waitress and waitresses waitress I I don't know. There was a few of us on the floor
18286080	18290960	But all of us unanimously assumed each other had gotten to that table
18292000	18294880	And they were sitting waiting for 20 minutes on nothing and I was
18295200	18301840	More like I felt so bad. I'm like felt so freaking bad. Honestly. Wait. I just under your turn. Um
18303040	18305520	And I still think about that couple to this day
18306160	18308000	I feel so sorry
18308000	18313440	But basically they all made me go because I was the youngest and they were like, well, they're not going to be pissy
18313520	18319840	Yeah, like a young waitress type thing. So I had to go but they were actually still like super nice. Um, and
18320160	18321280	Um
18321280	18328880	Because the owner worked with us like I explained the situation and we didn't charge them for drinks type thing
18329040	18335520	Like I think it's called cop pain or something like when you don't get the person to
18336720	18338720	um
18339200	18341200	Right, we need to switch off this guy
18343120	18345600	Because he'll run ahead which you really shouldn't do
18346320	18348320	um
18348560	18354480	I bet you made bank getting all the tips because you're so charming. Well, funny you mentioned that I had, um
18356480	18362960	A co-worker who used to send me to get payments from folk because I was like a
18363680	18365680	A peer very young and I look very young
18366240	18367520	um
18367520	18372240	And he was like, oh, they never tip me because I'm a guy but you're a chick
18372800	18376720	So they'll tip you they'll tip you so you go out and get them to pay like say oh
18376720	18378720	It's your turn to pay and all that
18378800	18380800	and
18380960	18382480	And I
18382480	18386480	It actually did work. Like I think we tried it and it definitely worked
18388480	18390480	And
18390480	18392160	you know
18392160	18395040	Strongly useful. Yes, I have a face of bobby
18395840	18397200	Oh
18397200	18400880	Because it's cutting the grass. Oh, there's a bill. All right. Okay. It's fine
18402320	18403920	Harris
18403920	18405920	I think there's an enemy in one of these
18407680	18410160	Shawnee didn't hit no from the start
18412240	18414240	Not quite
18414320	18419680	Of course it works. They proved it in mythbusters. Wait, they didn't mythbusters that you get more tips if you're a chick
18420160	18422880	I believe it. Oh bomba. How much bomba?
18423520	18425520	What 100 bomba?
18426880	18428880	That's actually pretty
18429440	18431200	too much
18431200	18433520	I just realized I haven't been checking the maps
18434480	18436480	There's treasure in the left
18437600	18439600	In the left
18440320	18446160	There's treasure that I've not picked up. Okay. I'm actually kind of glad I've actually not gone back into the other temples
18446960	18452480	Oh, there's treasure in here. What's the treasure? It's a freaking trap shadow wizard money gang
18453200	18455200	We love kissing spells
18457760	18459520	They got me
18459520	18461520	Yay, we got you shells
18462160	18466560	Okay. Well, that was actually kind of lucky because that I didn't wait. Is there like a thing here?
18467840	18469840	Oh, there is
18473040	18475040	Shawnee's passive, let me take your money
18476160	18478160	If you're cute and nice
18478640	18483120	Yeah, like I used to read the reviews and I always got mentioned in the reviews like ah, sorry
18483120	18485760	I took so much pride in my movie waitress job
18485840	18487840	Like I know some people might like well
18488160	18490800	You guys wouldn't because you guys are reeflands and you guys get up
18490880	18496880	But like some people then like oh it used to be a waitress like all you did was serve and like used to clean toilets at the end of the day
18496880	18501440	And I'm like, yeah, I used to take pride in my work. I love my job. It was so fun and
18502240	18504560	everything was like such a nice experience and
18505440	18509360	Yeah, and I got to talk to people from all around the world because um
18510160	18512560	it was like a tourism cafe and
18513120	18518000	Like fuck yeah, I enjoyed my job like let's fuck up. Never anyone
18519440	18523360	You know, some people are like embarrassed about their tail. I'm like no, I haven't made some time like it's a fuck size
18523360	18525360	But like it's so fun
18525920	18529040	No one should be ashamed of their job not then maybe like literally
18530560	18532160	like
18532160	18536160	I've never been thinking about it was like because I think if you ever like if
18536240	18540560	If you talk to someone who's like never had a job before and they're like, oh you used to have to clean toilets
18541120	18543120	Yeah, it's just part of the job like
18543280	18546400	Someone's taking a fat job a although I will say one thing
18546400	18551760	I had a really good boss if someone's fucking bombed the toilet. No, I didn't have to clean it
18552320	18558000	Because my boss was so good like if it was like absolutely fucking nasty as fuck my boss would do it
18561840	18563840	I don't trust this room
18564240	18566240	Oh, well, there you go
18566640	18568640	No, my boss was amazing
18569600	18571600	It was literally a
18573120	18578240	Change my life unironically. I know it sounds silly, but saying like oh that job changed my life
18578480	18581680	But I like it actually unironically that they'll change like trajectory
18583440	18588000	Um, because I was like very unconfident. I was like so unsure of myself. So
18588880	18591440	How did I miss this? This is out in the open
18592720	18595120	Right, let's go south see what happens
18596560	18597600	Ow
18597600	18602240	How did I bump off the edge of the map? Right, I'm pretty sure we're supposed to dig here
18604560	18607920	Oh in the money
18610880	18617120	Hello, we get to buy another couple of shells with that 800 coins for that
18618960	18623840	But here uh fairies jump out of those things as well here
18624000	18628160	Sorry, please don't shoot me. I'm just a little guy
18630960	18638560	Because you ignored everything basically they got kinstones open. How dare you how dare you accuse me of my terrible gameplay
18639600	18642160	Even though I've shown it here in 4k
18643680	18648880	Literally dropping the album having a good boss makes everything so much easier. Oh, tell me about it
18650640	18652640	Like at the care home
18653600	18658000	Look, I'm just saying if you ever want to do the care home
18660880	18662880	I'm pretty sure they committed like
18663040	18665040	paycheck fraud with me
18665120	18668800	and because when I like wrapped up my employment
18669600	18671600	um, I got like extra
18671840	18677520	500 great British pounds and I had to phone them up and be like you've overpaid me like you've paid me my
18677760	18683680	Like my wages when I've not worked with you and they were like no no just take it and I'm like
18685600	18691120	What do you mean just take it like a phone during everything no no just take it just
18700000	18706800	So basically when I departed from the care home, I got like extra 500 quid from day nothing
18708320	18713760	We are going to go spend all this money because this is it. Do you mind you're literally in my way in my way
18714800	18717360	Okay, you can't actually run off into the next segment
18718480	18720640	A little saucy. Oh, it was saucy. All right
18721200	18722640	and
18722640	18726640	I'm not going to complain an extra 500 quid in my pocket. They made me I was off on one
18728000	18730000	and
18730000	18732080	Put it in my wee bank account. Right. We're gonna buy
18732480	18737680	Out what shells we can because we have far too much money and nothing to spend on
18740640	18745040	Yeah, care homes are an absolute mess like they constantly change hands of management
18745040	18747360	They constantly change companies and all of that
18748160	18752880	They're constantly understaffed a stupid diss amount of understaffing
18753840	18758160	Um, and they do it on purpose to maximize like earnings and all of that

21148560	21154400	Another one right. Let me buy the paper up at the postie before I commit to another one
21156320	21158560	Because I need all my papers from the postie
21160880	21164800	Hello, we've got a new issue for you. Yes, give me give me

21185120	21187200	Oh, I'm burping away over here. Sorry, right
21190160	21192880	Yes, what are the spawn locations?
21193840	21199680	Okay, it's very unlikely the first time we do this we get it because of the spawn locations changing
21201920	21206160	Uh, wow, they are not close by holy moly
21207360	21209360	That's the spawn locations
21210160	21212160	Halfway across the map
21212160	21213600	The third and fourth
21213600	21217760	Oh my god, get out of my way guard if you could evaporate that'd be classic right now
21217760	21222080	That'd honestly be classic. I could only have four she wants six
21223120	21224640	Oh
21224640	21226640	dear
21226640	21229920	At least the white ones tolerate you like holding them
21231440	21233440	Only
21234000	21237520	How am I supposed to get six to her? I can't pick up
21238640	21243200	I'm out of time unless I can throw it. Can I eat it? Can I punch it? Can I punch it? Oh
21246560	21251120	What was that? Hmm not enough. Why are they so far away?
21252960	21254960	Need no clips. She said five
21256560	21260000	And wait, I could have done it if I didn't mess up the pickup right hold on
21260000	21264240	I can't remember where the other ones where I've already freaking forgotten right. There was one on the staircase
21264320	21269680	You're coming with me right. There's one also there by the staircase. It's just fine. We can come back for him

21370160	21372160	Oh

21468400	21471440	Oh, please tell me she gives a heart piece
21475280	21485360	All right, one's right at the door. That's fine. One's by the water. That's fine
21489200	21492240	One's by the shop the general store
21493680	21495680	Up the waterfall maybe
21496800	21498800	No
21499760	21505920	Well, you're probably going to be a lot faster. Okay, we know there's no two up north which is fine
21506720	21511040	And there's not one by the dog. We're just doing information gathering on this one. Okay
21511760	21513760	It's not a big deal
21513760	21514880	Okay
21514880	21517680	Yeah, I do not have enough time to reach
21519520	21522000	Unless pause
21525280	21527280	Oh, we did it
21527920	21529920	Oh

21554800	21556800	I'll buy the next one
21558640	21564320	Just unequipped your sword. I never even thought of that. Holy crap. Where have you been all my life?
21566400	21569440	No, we all had to do is unequip the sword
21570880	21575680	So the chickens would stop running halfway across the map when I touched them with my pointy sword
21576800	21580480	Yeah, take that right. Well, I definitely don't want to accidentally activate that item
21583920	21585920	Decape a terrible idea
21587760	21591840	All of these seem like terrible ideas have it. What do you want?
21593760	21597840	She gives me an extra five seconds to catch a whole other chicken
21598880	21601600	Oh, you're taking the absolute mincemeat honestly
21603680	21608960	Oh, all right. Okay. I'm not right. Okay. This is just information gathering clearly

21617120	21621280	Okay, let's try the waterfall. I call it the waterfall, but it's not one here
21621600	21627520	I am not picking up a golden chicken. I actually refuse. I'd call me chickenist. I don't care
21628160	21633280	I am not picking up a golden chicken. They are liars. They are cheats and they smell bad
21636000	21638000	Okay
21638480	21643920	Is that six? One, two, three, four, five, six. Oh my god, we did it. It's so much easier if you just don't touch them
21646640	21648640	That's up
21649360	21651360	Please be done
21651920	21653920	That's it. You got

21687440	21691600	Oh, there is but it's golden. Don't trust it. Don't trust the golden chicken
21695440	21698480	Oh, maybe trust it a little bit because we can just start right in

21746400	21751280	The next manual because she's actually giving me so many rupees we can buy all the manuals

21783040	21785040	women

21795680	21797680	I don't trust it
21799120	21804480	I don't trust it. They like on the other side of the okay. They're like literally on the other side of the map

21810480	21814720	Shoe shop as for the other one
21816960	21820560	There's where exactly by the skull no

21832720	21833920	Maybe
21833920	21835920	If no one gets in my way
21836800	21840000	I said if no one gets in my way then maybe I can make it
21842240	21844800	We may have done it we may have done it
21846000	21849840	Wow, we actually did it. Please be the last one and I'm so tired
21850800	21852800	Time's up. Time's up. Yes. Yes
21854160	21856400	Thanks. Here's your reward king stone piece
21859280	21861280	Darling
21861600	21863600	What do you want now three
21864320	21867920	And they're on the other side of the map, of course, because why wouldn't they be?
21870320	21872320	No
21872320	21878320	No, I don't know right. This is just information gathering. I'm not even
21884800	21888880	Is there any on this side of the map? I don't think so because the dog would block you
21889840	21893840	Right, are you John? Get another
21895200	21897200	That's what I think about you as well
21899600	21903760	All right, let's just check out the town center nothing
21906080	21910480	A golden one is I have to contend with two golden chickens
21911600	21913600	Oh, I don't know if I can do that
21914240	21916960	Sorry, we're gonna have to do a bit more information gather
21917120	21921040	That's the three two golden and one weight from halfway across the map
21922000	21924000	Oh, I don't know about that darling
21927600	21929600	I don't know if I can do this
21930160	21936400	It's the last mission is it actually you're not trolling me. She shouldn't be able to have chickens. I haven't much I drown
21936400	21938400	I'm honestly
21940160	21942160	Uh, right, we'll do a run
21943600	21950960	We're gonna swim across the water to get that blue one the white one. Sorry and literally run like nothing on earth
21953040	21954640	Wait unless
21954640	21959760	Can I throw it without getting in the water? I can okay curious curious
21960240	21964160	That's probably our solution. Unfortunately. It does get a bit freaked out
21965280	21967680	But if that is our solution
21967920	21969120	I
21969120	21974160	Was going to say to because to go all the way around seems pretty impossible from being honest
21974240	21979440	And then the golden one should be here go down here and then pick you up and go down there and pick you up
21979440	21983120	Then go down there and freaking pick you up and then go there
21983680	21987760	No pick you up and then go there right. I've not got it
21987920	21992480	But I think I have the mechanics that I'm supposed to participate in down
21993120	21994960	which is fine
21994960	21998000	I kind of just need to like pick it up so it doesn't change its mind
22003120	22008480	We are never having the velar farm at this rate. No not by the way. I'm fucking handling these champions honestly
22010240	22012240	Right get the white one first
22016240	22022000	No, don't get stuck on something long. We're literally in a time crunch right don't

22153680	22160000	Of course, I would need to break the pots in her house first in order to enable me to do what I need
22160320	22162320	Of course, don't be silly
22163600	22169360	How preposterous of me to break a pot. I'll break your fucking pot honestly

22175440	22177440	Break a pot

22190880	22194880	Exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. You are not replacing those pots
22195040	22200080	I will destroy them every single time you'll waste all your earnings and you will never quash
22200800	22204800	Of course, it's okay. It's okay. Of course I would need to break the pot. Why would I need to break the pot? Of course I would need to break the pot
22205680	22207680	I'm losing it
22209280	22220160	Okay, I don't know if we can a hundred percent it because unfortunately I am running very low on ideas of what I need to do next

22236480	22238960	And I was just thinking about building a new house. This is great
22239760	22244400	Imagine moving from a musty old mushroom to a fabulous house like this. It's like a dream come true. I'm glad
22245600	22247600	Wait, so you don't want to like do
22248720	22250720	any trading

22597120	22599120	Nothing on the lake is highlighted
22600640	22602640	Nothing in this area is highlighted
22603680	22606800	Western world two trees have moved up
22607360	22614880	Windrunes there was something we also missed something in the caster winds, but the claiming we actually
22615280	22618400	Didn't miss anything which I'm glad because that location is
22620000	22621280	stinky, uh
22621280	22623280	the castello
22623280	22626960	Waterfall definitely haven't explored the waterfall properly
22628800	22630480	The ranch
22630480	22633040	Gideons we haven't finished yet. We might have to

22646560	22651760	First western world two trees fell windrunes and swamp
22652080	22657600	I think swamp that was literally the only thing that we missed so we might actually go back to swamp, you know that
22658480	22663840	And then we'll come back and finish off whatever is going on. Azura is live now. Are they both still on?
22668960	22671680	That game. Yeah, that game. Yeah jellybean game
22672800	22676000	You missed the grave keepers instructions for directions through the wood

22678960	22682640	No, the collab finish Azura is on one shot. She's addicted to one shot
22682640	22685600	I don't even know what one shot is. I've never heard of it since she's playing

23522000	23524480	No, I did get a heart from here. So that wasn't that bad
23524880	23528480	But he was like wow, I don't normally get visitors here and I'm like, well
23529760	23531760	Good job finding this place

23594800	23597520	I don't know how hard it is to source pearlescent material, but
23599280	23601280	Huh, right, let's check the HUD
23602160	23604480	We haven't really done much on the waterfall

24411920	24413920	Oh, it's the library
24414000	24416560	Did you jump in the bell? I did jump in the bell
24417760	24419760	I'm gonna unlock the next edition
24421280	24424720	Welcome. Yes. Yes. Yes. I've almost finished
24426080	24430240	Right, we'll go bottom left. No, no, I didn't mean it but thanks. Oh, I appreciate it
24430880	24437920	Um, we'll go bottom left and the reason for that is because there was a few dig sites we unlocked
24439760	24442480	Uh, there's a up here
24446080	24448240	Man, just let me cut the grass in peace. Okay
24449680	24456320	Some of us need to to feed their gacha habit and if I'm going to fund it by cutting grass then just leave me to it
24456320	24459360	Okay. Oh, there we go. That's what we'll see. Wee
24460880	24462880	Okay
24464480	24466480	All right fallen trees
24468160	24470160	All right, this one's
24471680	24473680	Wow
24474240	24476240	Soon soon
24476320	24479840	Wait, that was a swamp. That was the guy's house
24482560	24487040	And then this one did we dig up we might have already done that
24487760	24492960	A bomb place. How do you guys spot the bomb places so easily?
24494480	24496480	A bomb place
24497520	24499520	Oops, a bomb place
24500320	24502320	That's here
24505680	24507680	A bomb place
24507680	24518960	Can you be this zero in a bit? I've already been in here
24524080	24526080	Nope to the right
24530720	24532720	Aww
24533440	24535440	Oh
24538000	24541040	Get in the bowl, hen. Thank you
24544640	24548240	She's me just going for a dip plus I watch you lovely ladies flutter about
24551680	24555440	I still don't get how you guys see that honestly. I would never have caught that
24556960	24558960	Um
24558960	24584960	We can dig this up, nice, nice, huge, is that everything for the sweet region here?
24585960	24586960	It was?
24587960	24588960	Oops, sorry.
24589960	24591960	Is that literally everything I've unlocked?
24591960	24595960	I just need to fuse stones with people, but I don't know where they're located, basically.
24598960	24600960	Hold on, just checking.
24601960	24606960	Right, I need to finish the post office, and I need to talk to that wife and get a charm off of her.
24606960	24610960	I need to finish the gacha, which I'm literally about to do.
24610960	24615960	I've not finished off the gorom, which is a shame.
24616960	24618960	The lake, apparently, is finished off.
24624960	24629960	Bro, I'm just shite, as it clearly is.
24631960	24634960	Is there any mythical features in Foch Foch, or tons?
24634960	24636960	Kelpies are probably the most well-known.
24637960	24638960	Um...
24641960	24646960	Kelpies are horses that convince you to ride their back, and then you drown.
24646960	24648960	So basically, like, marry me.
24649960	24650960	Um...
24651960	24653960	Right, we have 300 rupees.
24653960	24657960	Let's go talk to this wife, and let's go get the latest issue.
24658960	24660960	We've got one more?
24660960	24662960	Hello, we've got a new issue, yes?
24662960	24664960	Yes, thank you, I would like it.
24667960	24674960	Um, right, we're actually going to purposefully fail a gacha, so we can make 10 rupees.
24674960	24678960	I've got 190, and it's 200 for an addition.
24678960	24680960	So we're going to purposefully fail this, okay?
24682960	24685960	We're going to purposefully fail this, please don't worry.
24685960	24687960	It is all by design.
24688960	24691960	The difference is Kelpies eat you after you drown.
24691960	24693960	Marry me to do that too.
24693960	24694960	Yeah, that's fine.
24694960	24695960	Okay, yes, yes, yes.
24695960	24698960	Okay, we need one, we just need to fail one more.
24698960	24701960	And before I win it, could you imagine?
24701960	24704960	I curse you with good luck, 3% probability.
24705960	24707960	That would be blessed.
24710960	24714960	You raid their back and they drown you, basically.
24714960	24718960	So Kelpies are like, marry me to drown you in water.
24720960	24721960	How many shells, right?
24721960	24723960	Let's get to work.
24725960	24731960	It's a hippocampus, so it murders in time.
24731960	24735960	Name to eat shells to get one correct gacha.
24737960	24740960	The classic red cap goblin is also a Scottish myth.
24742960	24745960	Big blue choo-choo appears in the temple of the droplet.
24745960	24748960	It's an ordinary blue choo-choo, faking him, minnish sizes, daunting.
24748960	24750960	Just try to avoid the electric.
24751960	24756960	Congrats, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime.
24757960	24758960	Wanna try again?
24758960	24761960	Yes, I think I have enough, question mark.
24768960	24769960	We do have enough.
24770960	24772960	Yes, name to eat, give me that little lever.
24774960	24776960	Kelpies are squashful.
24777960	24781960	King Daltas.
24782960	24785960	Congratulations, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime.
24785960	24786960	Do we have enough?
24786960	24788960	We do have enough for another roll.
24788960	24789960	Wanna try again?
24789960	24791960	I absolutely would love to.
24791960	24792960	Yes, please.
24792960	24793960	Oh, no.
24793960	24794960	Oh, well.
24794960	24796960	Okay, 2% gacha.
24796960	24798960	Wish us luck.
24798960	24800960	2% gacha.
24801960	24803960	Yeah, surprise, surprise.
24803960	24805960	Yeah, I don't think so.
24805960	24809960	I think there's legit like 4 missing.
24810960	24812960	1, 2, 3.
24826960	24828960	3, wow.
24828960	24830960	Okay, 3 more.
24831960	24834960	2% is better odds than a gacha 5 star.
24836960	24839960	Well, after this, it's literally 2 more and we're done.
24839960	24840960	We are done with gacha.
24840960	24843960	We can finally access that room.
24847960	24850960	The third last one is...
24851960	24853960	Aw, Ren's sleep.
24853960	24854960	Ren's shoe shop.
24854960	24856960	Using a secret technique, he makes shoes in his sleep.
24856960	24858960	Princess Zelda is his thing.
24858960	24861960	His biggest source of income.
24861960	24862960	That's cute.
24862960	24863960	Okay.
24863960	24868960	We are out of shells so we can't do it again until we get a few more.
24868960	24871960	But literally 2 more to go feels good, man.
24874960	24876960	Oh, hello, Popper.
24876960	24877960	You're in the way.
24877960	24878960	In the way.
24878960	24879960	Yeah.
24879960	24880960	Nope, you're straight back in the way.
24880960	24881960	Yep, there you go.
24882960	24883960	Oh, wait.
24883960	24886960	We're gonna talk to her so she gives us her blessing thing
24886960	24888960	because she does...
24888960	24889960	Yes.
24891960	24895960	We're just gonna use that so she can give me the charm.
24896960	24897960	What does it do?
24898960	24900960	Blue Link can't hurt you.
24900960	24902960	He isn't real Blue Link.
24903960	24904960	That is cursed.
24905960	24908960	And last but not least, yes, give me it.
24908960	24910960	And then that's fully gone.
24913960	24914960	All done.
24914960	24915960	What do you see now?
24915960	24917960	You now have the full collection of layers,
24917960	24920960	but I guess you must know all kinds of stuff now, huh, Professor?
24921960	24922960	Are you flirting with me?
24922960	24923960	I will...
24924960	24926960	I will perish right now.
24928960	24929960	Let's see.
24932960	24934960	No one...
24936960	24940960	No one wants to link our cheeky stones.
24940960	24943960	I'm really struggling to find anyone who wants to do it.
24945960	24946960	Read.
24946960	24948960	Do you want me to read?
24949960	24951960	Oh, I'll go and take another one.
24956960	24958960	Purple Burglar Alarm Link.
24960960	24962960	No, you don't want to trade either.
24966960	24970960	You still need to buy the Goron...
24976960	24977960	What?
24979960	24981960	Did I really have nowhere else to go?
24983960	24986960	I don't know if I should just go back to that field and farm it,
24986960	24988960	that one that's like to the west.
24989960	24992960	Did you dock with the Minish in the bookshelf?
24993960	24994960	I think so.
24995960	24997960	I'll just go back to make sure.
24997960	24998960	Make sure.
25003960	25006960	I've seen games with a 1 in 15,000 drop.
25006960	25009960	See, that just like completely turns me off.
25009960	25012960	I'm like, well, I'm without lucky, so what's the point?
25012960	25014960	I wouldn't even spend my pennies on it.
25014960	25016960	I'll see if there's any we Minish.
25016960	25018960	Actually, I do need to go back to the mining village
25018960	25023960	because I think there possibly had been someone that might want to...
25023960	25026960	Oh, there's a wee guy up there, maybe he wants to...
25027960	25028960	You're still playing this.
25029960	25030960	I went to bed when you started.
25030960	25032960	Well, you must have got a terrible sleep.
25032960	25034960	There's only been seven hours, you need eight.
25036960	25038960	Okay, we'll go back.
25038960	25040960	We'll go back to the mines after this.
25040960	25042960	The children yearn for the mines.
25051960	25052960	I did have a terrible sleep.
25052960	25053960	Exactly, see?
25054960	25057960	Reminds me of how I thought I could get the woodcutting pen.
25061960	25063960	Oh, so you passed the trial and returned.
25063960	25064960	I'm so jealous.
25064960	25066960	But if you're going on an adventure,
25066960	25068960	there's no one better to learn for the elder.
25068960	25071960	He's so manly, so rivally, and so full of fire.
25073960	25074960	Oh, it's green though.
25075960	25079960	It's not very important if it's green, unless I'm mistaken.
25080960	25082960	Oh, I'm not back at the swamp.
25082960	25085960	Come on, have you never been to the swamp so many times?
25085960	25087960	No, it's just for jewelry.
25088960	25089960	Jewelry for gems.
25091960	25092960	Well done indeed.
25092960	25094960	You're almost as surprised as I was at your age.
25096960	25097960	How about again?
25097960	25098960	No?
25101960	25104960	No, I can only do it once and it was green.
25104960	25106960	I wasn't even an important one.
25107960	25109960	Get out of my swamp.
25109960	25111960	I mean, honestly, we're what?
25111960	25113960	Missing three heart containers?
25114960	25115960	That's not that bad.
25115960	25116960	It could be way worse.
25119960	25121960	I feel like three heart containers is pretty good.
25121960	25123960	I actually have no clue what I'm missing, but...
25126960	25127960	Maybe.
25128960	25130960	Just maybe we do the boss.
25130960	25131960	Because when does Mercy come on?
25131960	25134960	We've got T minus two hours for Mercy, so...
25137960	25139960	I will get the last gacha, though.
25139960	25141960	I want to do the gacha part.
25141960	25143960	Addicted, I know.
25143960	25146960	I'm gonna cut grass for the gacha.
25147960	25149960	I can't believe I'm saying this one.
25149960	25151960	I'm a way to cut grass for gacha.
25160960	25162960	Oh my god, that's when you know it's bad.
25162960	25164960	Start doing manual labor.
25167960	25168960	Terrible.
25168960	25170960	They're not dropping anything.
25173960	25175960	As if he hits me.
25178960	25180960	See, these guys are so in awe.
25180960	25182960	Go and just perish me.
25184960	25187960	I need 200 coins to buy 30 more.
25192960	25195960	This is gonna take forever this way.
25196960	25199960	Why didn't you get the rest of the red rupees at the bean?
25199960	25201960	Oh, I don't know where that bean is.
25201960	25205960	My inventory was full, so I didn't want to pick up anymore.
25211960	25213960	Me wallet was full.
25213960	25214960	Can't believe it.
25215960	25216960	I'm at 41.
25216960	25219960	This is gonna take forever cutting grass.
25219960	25221960	Was it this one?
25221960	25224960	If it was, that's incredibly lucky.
25227960	25230960	Oh, I'm beating them up.
25234960	25237960	If it was this one, then...
25237960	25239960	How much do I need?
25239960	25240960	Shell.
25240960	25243960	Oh, I need quite a few more to be honest.
25243960	25246960	Oh wow, I just cut that arrow in the air.
25251960	25255960	I wonder how much time on my life I spent cutting grass and Zelda.
25256960	25258960	Link gets the job cutting grass.
25258960	25261960	Okay, that'll help out quite a bit.
25261960	25264960	That was, we've got 230 rupees now,
25264960	25270960	which means we can buy 30 more so we can get the second last ketchup.
25270960	25274960	Or we could just keep farming to be honest.
25274960	25277960	I don't know, I think we're gonna have to farm for this.
25277960	25279960	Is that a special?
25279960	25280960	Has it got fairy in it?
25280960	25282960	Yep, it was special.
25282960	25283960	See?
25285960	25286960	Ow.
25293960	25294960	Did I do this right?
25294960	25297960	That other one gave me six coins in one go.
25301960	25302960	Drapped.
25304960	25307960	Remember catching chickens give shells on money?
25307960	25309960	Oh no!
25310960	25312960	My biggest enemy.
25313960	25315960	Like, for real, for real though.
25315960	25317960	Is there something here I've yet to do?
25317960	25318960	Or did I already do that?
25318960	25320960	I already did it.
25326960	25329960	Did you check the orange people flowers?
25329960	25330960	Where?
25330960	25334960	I checked up on the guy, but he never did me anything.
25339960	25341960	I'll see how hard these chickens are.
25341960	25344960	Maybe, maybe I can't believe I'm saying this,
25344960	25347960	but maybe it's worthwhile to go run around and look after chickens.
25347960	25348960	What's that, 90?
25348960	25350960	I think that's about 400%.
25355960	25358960	Second last figure, we can do it.
25358960	25359960	Second last.
25360960	25362960	What's it gonna be?
25362960	25363960	Oh, you're back.
25363960	25364960	I am back.
25364960	25366960	And I'm addicted.
25367960	25369960	Probability is one.
25371960	25372960	One.
25375960	25378960	Wait, so am I gonna have a move for 100% guarantee?
25383960	25385960	I don't have enough to put 100 shells in.
25385960	25388960	I am not risking it, sauce, but...
25388960	25391960	Oh my god, I can't even get rid of it!
25391960	25394960	No, I'm sorry, I am not risking all those shells
25394960	25397960	just to get it, just to not get it.
25397960	25398960	Roll them bones, no.
25398960	25401960	You guys have no idea how unlucky I am.
25401960	25404960	Did you not watch the Buckshot Relay Stream?
25404960	25408960	Where I lost on the tutorial twice or something?
25408960	25410960	So we can clip it if it goes wrong.
25410960	25413960	No, I am not that brave.
25413960	25415960	I literally, I lost.
25415960	25417960	We never lose.
25417960	25419960	All gambas quit.
25419960	25421960	Right, I can't believe I'm saying this,
25421960	25423960	but we're gonna give the chicken a try.
25425960	25428960	See if that'll give us the money we're looking for.
25428960	25429960	Hi.
25430960	25432960	Sure, what do you want?
25433960	25437960	These are the ones that are halfway across the map.
25438960	25441960	No, I'm not playing in your stupid chicken game.
25441960	25443960	Fuck you, I'm going to the swamp, where is it?
25443960	25444960	Down.
25444960	25446960	No, oh, no, down.
25446960	25450960	No, I am not, I'm not playing in your chicken games
25450960	25452960	where they're halfway across the map.
25453960	25456960	I'm going to the swamp and there's nothing you can do about it.
25456960	25459960	Swamp to kill this little golden goose thing.
25462960	25465960	Where was it? Was it down here?
25466960	25468960	What is that?
25470960	25473960	Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
25473960	25476960	I'm actually really bad at that, I don't know.
25478960	25480960	Can I go down that pool?
25481960	25483960	What do you want to do?
25484960	25485960	Ow.
25489960	25491960	Oh, well, yeah, you're right, I could have gone to that one,
25491960	25493960	that would have been a lot quicker.
25493960	25495960	But we're here, we're here, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
25495960	25498960	Look, it's about the journey, it's about the experience
25498960	25501960	we made along the way, the experience we made losing our health.
25501960	25503960	Row, wake up.
25505960	25506960	Wake up.
25507960	25508960	Wake up.
25512960	25515960	Prepping slow cooked stew while watching strongly.
25515960	25516960	Good girl, man.
25516960	25518960	Oh, that's what you did.
25518960	25520960	Oh wait, did I go in here?
25520960	25523960	Is this new or am I just making it up?
25523960	25525960	Have I been in you before?
25525960	25527960	I have, because I've already...
25527960	25531960	I can trade, I can trade, please take it, take my stone.
25532960	25536960	It's been so long, four minutes.
25536960	25539960	You're beanstalk as well.
25539960	25541960	We're in the money, boys, we're in the money.
25541960	25546960	Beanstalk as well as Golden's thingy, my Bobber.
25549960	25551960	Oh, and I'm like two centimeters away from it.
25551960	25553960	Oh my god, you're such a good boy, little Minish thing.
25553960	25555960	Hold on, have you got another trade for me?
25556960	25558960	You don't, but that's fine, we're gonna go to the Minish mines.
25558960	25560960	I keep forgetting to go to the Minish mines.
25561960	25563960	Oh my god, we're doing it.
25563960	25564960	We're doing it, I can do it.
25564960	25566960	Shawnee's just gonna try and fill two more,
25566960	25567960	so we're perfect, right?
25567960	25569960	I've not even killed the main boss yet.
25569960	25571960	I've not even done the boss fight.
25571960	25573960	I'm too busy like getting distracted,
25573960	25575960	like doing all these wee side things.
25575960	25577960	I was gonna try and a hundred percent it,
25577960	25579960	but I have no idea what I'm missing,
25579960	25581960	like I'm not smart enough.
25582960	25584960	Clean, clean, clean, clean.
25584960	25586960	I'm climbing, I'm climbing.
25586960	25588960	Oh!
25589960	25591960	You got large quiver!
25591960	25594960	So we can hold 90, oh, 90 bombs, 90 now.
25594960	25596960	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll take it, I'll take it.
25597960	25599960	Did that thing get away down again?
25599960	25600960	That's fine.
25602960	25604960	Copium telecom is doing.
25605960	25607960	Right, let's go get that sneak,
25607960	25610960	and then we can finally a hundred percent our gacha pawn.
25611960	25613960	I like how the sneak just let me beat them up earlier,
25613960	25615960	and now that's fine.
25618960	25620960	Right, I actually...
25621960	25623960	Oh wait, there's a freaking short cut right here
25623960	25625960	that I walked right past.
25625960	25627960	Cutting the grass.
25627960	25628960	Cut the grass.
25628960	25630960	Can't wait to play grass cut or similiar.
25632960	25635960	I'm actually surprised the power washer doves
25635960	25637960	aren't coming out with some stuff.
25637960	25639960	I'm pretty sure you can't activate them
25639960	25641960	or hurt them from behind.
25643960	25645960	We need to not upset them.
25645960	25648960	I mean, did you get oiled up for the clap audio?
25650960	25653960	Yeah, you can hear me put it on, actually.
25653960	25656960	You can hear me take off the apparel
25656960	25658960	and put on the...
25660960	25662960	Oh, okay, okay, okay.
25662960	25664960	And...
25664960	25666960	Put on...
25668960	25671960	I've taken a while to make the power wash on that.
25675960	25677960	It's a battle of the laser beam!
25680960	25682960	Oh, I love the laser beam.
25683960	25685960	Did I unlock something else here?
25685960	25687960	I have a feeling I unlocked something else here.
25688960	25690960	I didn't.
25692960	25694960	Okay, I love this laser beam.
25694960	25696960	Stay with me all the time.
25697960	25698960	That's what I want to see.
25698960	25699960	That's what I want to see.
25699960	25701960	Right, how much money?
25701960	25703960	Oh, I'm only 150.
25706960	25708960	Is that supposed to do something else?
25708960	25709960	Where does it come from?
25709960	25711960	Maybe...
25712960	25714960	Maybe...
25714960	25716960	something?
25717960	25720960	Should I be giving chat a large cover right now?
25720960	25722960	That was so good.
25722960	25724960	Well, it's getting uploaded first, right then.
25725960	25728960	I think I'll tame it to come on...
25728960	25730960	to go live, like, an hour before AC,
25730960	25732960	because I don't want it to, like...
25732960	25734960	It's not going to disrupt AC's stream,
25734960	25735960	but...
25735960	25737960	I mean, you didn't even want to...
25737960	25739960	I don't want to, like...
25740960	25742960	Obviously...
25742960	25744960	Yeah, I'm trying to pick more words.
25744960	25745960	I don't want to be, like...
25745960	25747960	I don't want to steamroll over my gen mates.
25747960	25749960	Also me, who streams for 12 hours,
25749960	25751960	so it's kind of unavoidable.
25755960	25758960	The last few heart pieces are actually in the dungeon.
25758960	25759960	Oh, okay.
25759960	25760960	Yeah, that was fine.
25765960	25768960	Was that supposed to do something with the orange guy,
25768960	25770960	or am I being trolled?
25775960	25780960	I think I'll just have to go farming in that field.
25780960	25782960	The orange flower guy?
25782960	25784960	Someone mentioned it again, and I'm like,
25784960	25786960	are you trolling me, or is there actually
25786960	25788960	something with that orange flower guy?
25790960	25792960	Did you say he was in town or not?
25792960	25793960	I don't...
25801960	25803960	Someone said...
25803960	25805960	Is it Beel?
25808960	25809960	Him?
25809960	25811960	Why hello there, thanks for coming by.
25811960	25813960	I start playing the theme.
25814960	25816960	No, I think I'm mistaken.
25816960	25817960	Right, this is the Gambo, man.
25817960	25819960	I'm not sure I want a Gambo, to be honest.
25820960	25822960	Beel sells...
25822960	25824960	Who's Beeto?
25824960	25826960	That guy, the guy I just spoke to.
25830960	25832960	The veggie man?
25836960	25838960	Click on the jar.
25843960	25845960	Why hello there, that is the weight
25845960	25847960	for people who want to get lucky.
25848960	25850960	Oh...
25850960	25852960	Okay, that's actually...
25852960	25854960	No, I did not have the money for that,
25854960	25856960	but thank you anyway for asking.
25859960	25861960	Okay, have you played Brit...
25861960	25863960	No, this is my only legend Zolda game.
25863960	25865960	I have not had any Zolda experience
25865960	25867960	other than this game.
25868960	25870960	Right, give me the money for cutting the grass
25870960	25871960	right now.
25871960	25873960	Hand over the money and no one gets hurt.
25873960	25875960	Did I make myself clear video game?
25877960	25879960	Check out all his other ones too.
25881960	25883960	Wind Walker.
25883960	25885960	Wah, he wants to trade.
25885960	25887960	I saw that, I saw that, he wants to trade.
25887960	25889960	I knew you would want to do it.
25889960	25891960	I knew it, I knew it.
25891960	25893960	I knew it, what do you want?
25893960	25895960	Please be a treasure chest, so I can get money
25895960	25897960	for easy peasy land and squeezing.
25897960	25899960	There's one for shells, is there?
25899960	25901960	I don't know where that is.
25901960	25903960	That's super easy to get to.
25903960	25905960	Right, we're heading straight for it.
25905960	25907960	We're making a b-link for it.
25907960	25909960	A perfect match.
25909960	25911960	Thank you, Grandad.
25911960	25913960	I appreciate it. Do you want to do it again?
25913960	25915960	Maybe?
25915960	25917960	No, sorry.
25917960	25919960	Sorry for even asking.
25927960	25929960	Have my money, don't hurt me.
25931960	25933960	Why are you giving me money though?
25933960	25935960	Wait, where the heck am I doing?
25935960	25937960	A little to the left?
25939960	25941960	Thank you again
25941960	25943960	for the tips.
25945960	25947960	Why are you giving me pieces
25947960	25949960	that I can't even do anything with?
25949960	25951960	I can't even do anything with them.
25957960	25959960	The bad guys always drop coins.
25959960	25961960	I feel like the baddies actually drop a decent amount of coins.
25961960	25963960	I'm just making that up.
25963960	25965960	I can't remember what this was.
25965960	25967960	Thank you again, Broly Legends.
25967960	25969960	As I struggle to say your name.
25969960	25971960	I've already...
25971960	25973960	And you don't trade
25973960	25975960	because that would be too easy.
25975960	25977960	Don't forget to pay your taxes.
25977960	25979960	No smile.
25979960	25981960	Just kidding!
25981960	25983960	I pay my taxes.
25983960	25985960	Thank you, Australian Government, for letting me set up businesses in your country.
25985960	25987960	I should have better tax rates
25987960	25989960	than in the UK.
25989960	25991960	I should have gone to Australia.
25991960	25993960	Let me set up a business.
25993960	25995960	Set one up in Australia.
26003960	26005960	This isn't helping either.
26005960	26007960	I'm not making any profit doing that.
26009960	26011960	I think we're just going to have to go grass farming.
26011960	26013960	You know that.
26019960	26021960	I'm trying to make the money
26021960	26023960	and the shales
26023960	26025960	like that.
26025960	26027960	Like in the grass patch.
26027960	26029960	Because I can do a lot of it in one go.
26031960	26033960	I'm sorry.
26033960	26035960	She says that she gets absolutely annihilated.
26035960	26037960	Do these guys drop money?
26037960	26039960	No.
26039960	26041960	I'm sorry.
26047960	26049960	You're just going to have to wait for me.
26049960	26051960	Be patient.
26051960	26053960	Please.
26053960	26055960	Get annihilated.
26055960	26057960	Is the grass patch a buffer below me?
26057960	26059960	Look at the ball.
26059960	26061960	Maybe.
26061960	26063960	Oh, maybe Parasy wants to trade.
26063960	26065960	Parasy might want to trade.
26065960	26067960	At least use the spin attack on the grass.
26067960	26069960	You are so correct.
26069960	26071960	Holy crap.
26071960	26073960	Parasy doesn't care.
26073960	26075960	Sorry, I just picked up you're saying that you just replaced.
26075960	26077960	Spin attack on grass.
26077960	26079960	Spin attack on grass.
26079960	26081960	Spin on the grass.
26081960	26083960	Spin on the grass.
26083960	26085960	Spin on the grass.
26085960	26087960	Spinning on grass.
26087960	26089960	Spinning on grass.
26089960	26091960	I don't know.
26093960	26095960	Oh my god.
26095960	26097960	I completely forgot I could even do this.
26097960	26099960	Holy crap.
26099960	26101960	Are you serious right now?
26101960	26103960	Completely forgot I could even do that.
26103960	26105960	This is going to be a lot faster than
26105960	26107960	what was originally going on.
26109960	26111960	Okay.
26111960	26113960	That's right. Drop me nothing game.
26113960	26115960	Drop me nothing. It's fine.
26115960	26117960	It's not like I wanted anything.
26117960	26119960	Okay.
26119960	26121960	We're getting shells.
26121960	26123960	Hold on a minute.
26123960	26125960	We're getting them soon.
26125960	26127960	Oh we're getting somewhere.
26127960	26129960	We're getting somewhere. Don't write it off yet.
26129960	26131960	Don't write off the tactics yet.
26131960	26133960	Don't write it off yet.
26133960	26135960	Don't write it off yet.
26139960	26141960	Pandoraeos?
26141960	26143960	Pandoraeos?
26143960	26145960	Pandoraeos.
26145960	26147960	Sure.
26147960	26149960	Thank you for the tip.
26149960	26151960	Why are we hurting Wre flings?
26151960	26153960	I mean, only if they consent.
26156400	26158400	Okay, I
26159640	26165720	Can't believe it. It's working unironically working. What are we at? We're at a hundred and six and
26166420	26169540	We're close to being able to buy 30 from the shop. Oh
26171900	26175860	My god, oh my god, it's actually working
26176440	26182060	Reflings suck that man off that suggested to do the spin attack
26183060	26187920	Kidding, that's actually not for me. It's more of an anything I think
26188940	26192380	It's more of an anything. Yeah, we respect it. We respect it
26199380	26201380	Oh
26206860	26208860	Yes, mommy

26319140	26323940	And like I know doki bird. I think she wanted to stream your pet, but then
26330540	26334100	Just sweet in your mouth

26414340	26420340	And I've been like absolutely scrounging around for any of them for like how long the entire game and
26421300	26423300	We're sitting in this
26424180	26425340	Right
26425340	26431500	Sorry, how many times have we not had one spawn? I do this like a handful of times and we've got like 10
26431940	26433740	rough I
26433740	26435740	Know your game living to Zelda
26437300	26439580	Your drop rates are doo-doo
26441620	26443620	I'm so sorry for the change of music
26446180	26451580	Yeah, yeah, yeah, and another one drops of course it's on another one while we're okay
26452860	26454980	Absolutely getting trolled right now about this game
26456420	26460780	Ever since like one pair links new landscaping business
26464740	26465740	Oh
26465740	26467740	I'm gonna be so happy when this is over
26468460	26472420	One we're in the 50s. We need to get to like
26474180	26479460	170 and then we can go by the other theory that are missing and we're done
26481020	26487740	We're done. We have we have completed the catch up and we can finally get into that freaking shot honestly. Oh
26487860	26489860	Oh
26492700	26497020	That was a good one that was a good one if you saw that I think that was for that batch

26507100	26509100	Oh
26513260	26519140	Terrible drop rate that time. Oh, no, we got to we got to we're about 60s rate. I just see 70

26890740	26893240	Okay reeflings it's time
26897460	26899780	I don't know how sensitive the ai is in this game
26904340	26906340	It doesn't seem too bad
26906580	26909460	Uh famous last words. I bet you it does seem too bad
26911060	26913060	I bet you a pie
26915220	26918500	Okay, okay. I'm not too bad. Not too bad. Let me get up. Let me get up

26924420	26931460	Can't see us can't see us. Take it easy. Oh, I'm supposed to go for it there. It's
26933140	26935140	When he turns back
26935780	26936900	piss
26936900	26938900	How did you see me?
26939700	26941940	I'm okay. They're a little bit more sensitive than I thought
26943380	26948100	Look, it's not bad being sensitive, but she's giving me a chance, you know
26948820	26950820	I
26952420	26954420	Head behind this bush
26959220	26961220	There we go
26961220	26963220	Look at a split
26964420	26966420	And hide behind here
26967300	26969300	How did he see me?
26971940	26977700	Am I doing the taming wrong is there maybe maybe there's a taming on the bottom two down there that I don't know about
26978340	26980340	I'm struggling
26980980	26982980	I'm needing uh an
26983300	26987860	Invisible cloak that would probably go quite that would go down quite well. I'm not gonna lie
26989780	26992660	I think you have fusing left, but it's hunting down the people. Yes
26992820	26996900	It's definitely fusing because there's so many things that are blocked off and I'm like bro. I don't even
26998180	27000180	Sneak past them into that
27000420	27002420	He turns
27003140	27007540	No, okay, there's definitely some sort of tile distance. I cannot cross
27009060	27011060	Hey, I never even came in
27011860	27014740	Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. I never even came in
27016020	27018740	Okay, definitely a tail distance. Keep that in mind
27022660	27027220	Tail distance any tail distance a analyzers
27028820	27032340	Analyze analyze analyze safe
27033860	27037860	Analyze analyze analyze safe
27039060	27041060	Analyze
27043780	27046820	It must be on the next input when he turns around go for it
27050420	27052420	Wow
27054260	27056260	Come on
27056580	27060820	Bro, we actually just want to like progress with the main quest. Can you just like let us in?
27062420	27063940	Can you just let us in we're
27064020	27071060	Genuinely just trying to play the game at this point not even like haha funny stealth like bro. We're just trying to play the game
27074900	27076900	Safe
27078260	27083540	Right when he goes down I can hide behind here, but then I need them to do another rotation
27085700	27088340	Which is fine and he will taste which is fine
27089860	27091860	He'll rotate
27091860	27093860	I'm out of you
27099380	27101380	Wah
27101380	27102740	Wah
27102740	27104740	Get that sword out right now
27106660	27111940	Oops, I hurt myself. It's fine. Oh wait, I don't have a full fairies. Do I I don't know where the other bottle is
27113220	27115220	I'll be an infusion need out
27116260	27118260	We made it
27122820	27129700	Okay, last element to infuse and everything's going to go all dark and not very nice, but that's just the way the games
27134500	27136500	And now it's golden
27139220	27141220	That looks like a beast of a sword
27144740	27146740	Oh, it's pretty
27147620	27155060	The power of the wind element has infused your blade with the power of the four elements your blade has become the four sword
27156100	27162660	Focus focus power in your blade and release a fire a beam use it to break batty's curse and restore the people
27170100	27172100	That's fantastic
27172820	27174260	Oh
27174340	27179940	Secret door. Hmm. Hmm. It seems that forging the sacred blade somehow opened that doorway
27180180	27185060	It must lead to the rooms that holds the secret of the light force link. We have to go inside
27187140	27189140	Oh
27189860	27191860	Oh
27192260	27198660	How interesting look at the images on the stained glass. I bet those pictures show us where the light force is hidden
27200420	27203540	In the principessa it's the opening
27205140	27208260	A long long time ago
27210740	27214100	When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow
27219940	27225460	The tiny picori appeared from the sky bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light
27227540	27231060	With wisdom and courage the hero drove out the darkness
27235220	27242180	When peace has been restored the people enshrined the blade with care
27244660	27251460	But here it is and the force of the golden light embodied in Hyrule's princess shone forth upon the land
27255940	27257940	So that's what it means
27258260	27260260	Oh
27260500	27266260	As low you really are too kind first you give me my magic cap and then you guide me here
27266660	27271380	You've been far too generous for now. I no longer have any useful. Yeah
27273060	27275060	Batty
27275140	27277140	Yes, that is brish. I don't know
27280100	27282100	What
27282420	27289060	At last I finally know the location of the light force it's the princess
27290820	27292980	Link wake up. Can you wake up?
27296020	27299780	Batty disguised himself as the king to search for the light force
27300100	27305780	When he learned of this place he waited for us to reforge the blade if that stained glass is accurate
27306180	27311460	Princess Zelda holds the light force batty will do whatever it takes to steal that power from her
27312100	27317700	If he succeeds, he may never be able to return the princess to normal
27318500	27321620	We've wasted too much time link. We must stop batty
27322420	27325860	Oh, yeah piss. Oh, yeah piss. We're on the timer. Are we actually though?
27326900	27328900	Or am I being trolled?
27330740	27335060	Why it's golden well, it's all different now, isn't it?
27338020	27340020	All different now
27342420	27344420	Oh
27346900	27352580	What what is this what's happened here? They've been turned to stone all of them the minister and the guard
27353540	27358180	Everyone in the castles like princess Zelda. This can only be the work of that evil batty
27358260	27363060	What cruelty link we must use the power of the sacred foresword to undo this evil
27363060	27365060	Oh
27372100	27374660	Thank you. Thank you. You're the one who returned me to normal, aren't you?
27374980	27379700	I don't know how you did it, but I cannot thank you enough. Listen. Have you seen how strange the king's been lately?
27380020	27383540	That's because it's not the king at all. It's batty. He's taken over the castle
27384100	27388100	One by one. He's turned us all to stone everyone cursed by his evil magic
27388500	27391620	Then the monsters arrived even paralyzed. I saw it all
27392180	27395380	I only pray it's not too late to undo this evil
27400500	27402500	There's so many
27403540	27408500	Link we need your help batty took a petrified princess to the roof of the castello
27408820	27414820	He must be planning something fiendish. You must stop him. I'm going. I'm going. Fuck me. I've only got two fairies in a ball
27416340	27418340	You're in my way, mate
27418740	27422100	Okay, we can get past
27423540	27426260	Thanks, mate. Thanks for not putting me in a dialogue as well actually
27426980	27428980	dark hyrule castello
27430340	27431540	Oh
27431540	27435220	Is this really hyrule castle? I can't believe it. What's happened here?
27435540	27438180	Patty's magic has grown more powerful than I imagined
27438660	27441540	But the king and zelda are in danger link. We need to go
27442820	27445380	Oh castle, but evil literally
27446340	27451060	Oh, I'm not full health. So I can't oh, I'm definitely not full health after that you don't
27452660	27454660	Fucking wait to add it up
27456900	27458900	These are fake rooms, yeah
27465540	27467540	Surely I won't burn myself
27476180	27478180	Oh
27478180	27480180	We go because we don't have the key
27485460	27488340	Oh the jail cell we'll get the jail
27489620	27495620	Can I undo you from here? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry. Sorry king. Oh, I can't eat you
27496580	27498580	Hold on. Hold on
27499060	27503220	Is this the final dungeon? I think so question mark
27504180	27509540	Fairy fairy fairy fairy. I've never been happier. See one of you you
27511620	27513620	You yank
27515860	27518420	I caught a fairy in a ball
27519220	27526020	Right there we go. We're fully healed now. We have three fairies at our disposal. Let's we'll put the name mess up a bit too much
27527460	27529780	Um, I don't have a key
27529780	27535060	I can't go that way but I can at least come in the back faster
27541380	27546980	I very easily could have gone wait, what the fuck am I trying to do? Sorry
27550180	27552660	I'm not supposed to be here yet
27553220	27555220	Thank you
27556180	27561540	Is it the same layout in super mario castle? Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to be there. I assume
27564820	27571060	I'm supposed to oh well the game is the game said take what you need right? I even need arrows. No, I don't
27573220	27576580	Wait, so I was supposed to what am I missing? I'm missing something
27576660	27582820	That was a fake door. This is a fake door. No, it's not okay
27585060	27588660	Uh, let's jump see if there's some time
27596020	27598020	Can you guys be
27598660	27600660	Right and then you next
27600980	27603460	And you next and you next nope
27603860	27610020	I'd rather stay feel healthy. Okay. That's a fake door. So there's something down here. I apologize
27611940	27618180	Am I to fall in the gap? Maybe that's what drops me into the cell. Okay. I think the gap drops me into the cell
27621460	27626980	Boss battle imminent and everyone's reset because why would we not reset?
27626980	27628980	Yep
27630420	27636740	No, this is just here. Okay that okay. I'm missing something. Sorry. Give me a second. I'm missing something
27638260	27643060	Now rattle the cages rattle rattle. Okay can't rattle the cages like a feral dog
27643060	27645060	Hmm
27655940	27658260	I can see I can get small there
27660020	27662020	Right now what?
27663220	27667860	Open sesame literally wait, can I like batter the door down maybe?
27674020	27676020	Oh
27677700	27680420	Should have been through the kids it seems to get blocked there
27683700	27688420	Yeah, it's getting blocked so I can't do that. I need a key to get to him
27692180	27694500	Spoiler alert, this isn't the final dungeon
27696260	27701780	If this isn't the final dungeon, I think I'm gonna need to call a food break. I'm already stuck
27701940	27703940	And I've not even gotten started
27705540	27708900	Is there really nothing back this way? Is it like a bomb?
27710580	27714100	Is there a tail that oh, there's a bomb on the wall, bro
27715940	27717940	Of course it's a bomb
27719700	27722740	I knew something was me right there. I was like, this is me
27725300	27727300	This is me working it
27728180	27730500	As if you come flying over to me
27732500	27736100	Okay, I need to fall down as a medium
27739540	27741940	This makes much more sense now
27743860	27747860	I was like there must be a wall I'm missing because I can't interact with anything that seems
27750660	27754100	Okay, I assume the switch is gonna open up the gates
27755060	27764100	Now although that makes no sense, I'm not going to question it at all and instead be thankful
27770260	27772180	Hello
27772180	27775940	Oh Link, are you the one who broke the curse and returned me to normal?
27775940	27779300	You've gone you've gone quite brave since the last time I saw you. I must say
27779540	27781540	Oh, but how those kisses
27781940	27783860	My love is under vice curse
27783860	27788260	Is this all the work of one man as king of hyrule? I must do something about this villain
27788420	27793060	But I'm old and I would only hold you back link. You have the sacred blade now
27793060	27794340	We must
27794340	27798260	You're gonna rely on the 12 year old. Please you must find a way to rescue my Zelda
27798340	27801460	Take the key. You can use it to get out of the castle from the basement
27802020	27805060	Ah use it to open locked doors. Yes
27807060	27809060	I will absolutely take that
27810260	27814420	Yeah, I said if you put the switch that opens the cell in the cell that shall I'm like, hmm
27814420	27817540	Not sure this would work out in theory. Maybe if it was like one-on-one
27819540	27821540	Actually
27823540	27825540	Link my boy
27827060	27833860	I might have to call a break and get like food in that and maybe try and squeeze out a loaf of bread, you know
27834420	27838180	It's not really it's not really happening. I'm not really sure what's going on with the look of bread situation
27839060	27841060	Okay, here we go. Here we go
27844820	27846820	I don't know how I avoided that but
27852020	27854180	I think there was a chest over here
27856900	27858900	There is
27861380	27863860	Do we even want to see how big this dungeon is
27863860	27867860	It's five levels
27878100	27884740	Yeah, uh, I'm gonna go with uh, let me get a break. Um, and I'll get some real food on me and
27885300	27888660	rehydrate and all that because uh, yeah, this is going to
27888820	27894180	Like how much time until mercy we've got less than an hour to try and do all of this
27895220	27898020	No an hour and 15 sorry and then mercy comes on
27908660	27910660	Wow
27910660	27914260	Lower time values sometimes referred to as the sage of dark winds and it is
27915220	27918260	Hected in later games as a demonic winged eyeball
27919140	27922180	He makes his home in the tower of winds, which is his final dungeon
27923300	27925060	Not the temple ones
27925060	27930580	Uh, right give me a minute. I'm gonna make a tea. I'm gonna make some lefto berries
27930660	27933220	I have no idea why even having the fridge to be honest
27934340	27938500	Um, and I'm gonna bake a loaf of bread not in all in that order
27939540	27942420	Some of the orders might be different, but I think we can do it
27942420	27947700	I think we can finish before mercy if I don't if I don't get absolutely rolled and smoked
27948980	27952180	Need to be on my a-game though. Need to be on my a-game
27952740	27954340	all right
27954340	27958260	Stoney buy some prunes. Actually, I have chocolate raisins
27958340	27962980	I've tried to eat them like twice on stream so far and I keep forgetting about them. Are we gonna raid into mercy?
27962980	27964980	I'm gonna try to raid into mercy. Yes
27965940	27967060	um
27967060	27969860	Oh, is that what that slot is for? Hold on
27972180	27973060	No
27973060	27977300	What the frick are these did anyone type what these are for or is it just like random space?
27977380	27980420	Nah, I can't even be random space. It looks like I'm gonna put it everywhere
27982180	27984180	Um
27984980	27988900	Right we speedrunning well, hopefully we can do it in the mirror
27992500	27997860	I'll let you guys analyze the mask okay, so you can tell me where I go when we get to that section
27998020	28000180	I'm sure you guys will be able to tell me where I go
28001460	28004420	Raisins do have some fiber even though they're covered in chocolate
28004820	28006660	do they count
28006660	28011140	Right, I'm uh, I'm gonna be a solid few minutes because you know, I don't know about you
28011300	28013860	But when I go to the toilet, you know, you need to bake the look
28014740	28018500	Right, I'll be back as quick as I can. Please stretch. Please get some water in here
28018500	28023540	Please go toilet time if you need toilet time and please go to sleep if you need to go honk

28420260	28422260	Logo Dogo

28442260	28446260	I've had enough of King Kong's finger knocking at the door then disappearing away again
28446260	28448260	I'm getting tired
28450260	28452260	Fake door
28452260	28454260	Real
28454260	28456260	Dark Glasgow castle
28456260	28458260	Glasgow DLC unlocked

28470260	28472260	I
28478260	28480260	Can't believe it
28490260	28498260	The bread might be a little overcooked by now. Yeah, the bread might be reekin
28500260	28507760	Perhaps the sword could reflect the black as low as low mate. I was in the middle of it. Maybe doing that
28514260	28516260	Christ
28517760	28520260	Something tells me my Scottish rage might come out
28520260	28522260	Hmm
28526260	28528760	I'm about to order take away to reward myself
28528760	28535760	I think this part of the game gets incredibly hard and like no child should be able to actually complete it as I said bye
28537260	28539260	I wouldn't work at lunch and strong he's still alive
28542260	28544260	We're gonna try and redirect him to me

28579260	28581260	My easy-peasy burger I
28582260	28588820	Have to admit my diet my diet gets terrible when I'm strumming because I don't have time to cook

28604260	28609860	Burger chips what drink cooler spray? I've just made a tea though

28627260	28629260	I don't know
28630260	28634820	And I'm not full health, so I can't even do the thing

28697140	28699140	Rookie that's the good news

29194060	29196060	And if I jump down there, I've already been

29246140	29248140	Suck up the carpet
29248380	29252860	Maybe something drops in this room and we're just a step too far ahead
29257020	29259020	Because I mean
29262300	29265500	I mean I can check if there's a oh
29268940	29273440	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew it. I knew it couldn't have been finished
29278460	29282140	Where are we heading? I'm getting nervous. Oh, it's the
29284620	29286620	Out in nowhere
29292620	29294620	And I accidentally actually dodged that
29297580	29299420	Oh

29303980	29305980	Yeah

29324540	29326540	Yeah

29341100	29348140	Because it's like helping me get past areas without taking any damage type thing and obviously if I take damage
29348140	29350140	I can longer do this move
29350620	29353100	So I'm quite appreciative of it
29353900	29355900	So

29420140	29423260	Does it take me out of the air or does the game just be like, yeah
29425580	29427900	I mean didn't take me out of the air
29429900	29433580	That's quite a facial expression want me being a goofy giver

29579340	29581340	To the dead end
29585100	29593180	Uh, not really sure if I'm to do anything at all actually. I don't think so. I'm supposed to shoot in my arrows
29594060	29599500	Oh, no, no, I'm not. Okay. Well, I'm not supposed to do this section at all. Hi
29600700	29606220	Thanks, please join in. We are currently on the last dungeon bit on Zell law
29607100	29613100	Uh, I'm also getting very nervous because I'm not very good at this section. I don't recall ever
29614060	29616060	finding it easy. Um
29617020	29619580	So childhood me kind of going out the window right now
29620540	29622540	It help wise
29623580	29625580	Oh
29627740	29631980	Whoa, that's what you get for being too close. Yeah, take that stinker
29633980	29635980	Stinky McGee
29641100	29643980	Oh, is that what the problem is?
29647180	29649180	Oh, well, there's not much of a problem
29649260	29654780	You're doing great so far we're getting there. I
29660700	29662700	Whoa
29663980	29665980	This is that's not hurting them
29671740	29673740	There's two of them
29674140	29676140	Oh
29677660	29679660	This is a bit of a
29682620	29684620	Have a hand moment
29687020	29689020	Got a cheap shot and
29691820	29693820	Throw it again. How dare you
29694380	29699420	Out. Okay. Whoa. I think they hit for a whole health. That's not good for at all
29700380	29705580	Yeah, if you guys can kind of separate yourselves off so you can get a few wax in that group
29707340	29709340	Do it again throw it again
29709740	29714300	See when they come in together like that, they don't like that. That's hard to kind of
29715100	29716860	can't even reach
29716860	29718860	can't even reach
29720300	29726620	Can't even reach my cheeks and that other guy is now protecting him because they're now stacked up uh game dips
29726620	29732060	If you could patch that out right now. Yeah. No, no, I understand. It's a very old. Wow
29732140	29735420	They are actually whacking me for one. I do not like that
29737020	29739020	I do not like that at all
29739340	29741340	Not one itty bitty bit
29742220	29747340	Okay, okay, okay much more. Yeah. Yeah. I deserve 50 for that. I'm not gonna lie
29748860	29752620	Do you want to throw it or we're just gonna play ball for the there we go
29753340	29755340	Okay
29755740	29761900	So what is where does the red take us just for curiosity? It takes us to the start of the castle
29763100	29766140	So if we really are up Shisa Creek, then we can
29767260	29771660	You can stun them with the boomerang. Okay. I think there was two of them. I was a bit like
29772860	29776380	But we do have a check point which is huge
29776380	29785020	That's not the right way that's opened by uh, is this a wall moment?
29786780	29788780	Yeah, it's not
29789420	29793900	We have a check point. That's the main thing. That's the most important thing. Okay that we have a checkpoint
29795340	29797820	Because this game's getting scary
29799660	29804380	If the enemy through starting to thwack for one, I'm not quite confident
29806380	29808380	I
29812620	29814620	You just put a bomb on this
29815740	29818140	Oh it falls well
29820140	29822140	Oh, that's the wrong one. Sorry
29824780	29826780	Huh
29830540	29832540	So what's the bomb before
29832940	29834940	Sorry
29846700	29853980	Am I missing something I might to pick up the bomb and throw it at them without taking damage question mark
29856220	29858540	Huh oh well close enough. Um
29859020	29861020	Um
29861340	29864700	Now that we have the red portal we can go back and get heals
29866060	29868860	So it's not really a problem
29870700	29874460	Can I pick up bombs like chickens? I can't
29882700	29884700	Oh
29885580	29891500	I want to say let me cook but um, I tried to place a bomb on the thing and it never let me
29894940	29898380	Yeah, it just falls down. Can you throw one?
29900060	29905900	Can I throw a bomb from above? I think no the bomb's gonna stay up on that top level
29907980	29911420	Oh wait, can I drop a bomb and throw it? Oh for fuck's sake
29911980	29915180	Wait because they don't explode on impact
29926060	29928060	That can't be right
29929500	29931500	And I can't place one on the tail
29934140	29936940	You've got a tamer I can't tame it. I don't have tamed bombs
29937900	29942540	Maybe it's just timing on the platform like I can stand on it and it just
29943660	29947020	Like luckily I have 85 but like there's no
29949180	29955740	You know what you know what game making a they're making a mockery at me ring the guards ring the guards
29957020	29959020	The guards are to be rang
29960300	29962300	Making an absolute mockery out of me
29963180	29965980	Absolute mockery right give me these fairies right now
29967740	29970140	Nope, sorry, okay, I'll take that

30026780	30029180	Wait, can I like throw a boomerang at space then?
30031580	30033820	No, I can't the boomerang does absolutely nothing
30035740	30038300	Is a bow and arrow do anything on the armor? Nope
30038540	30044860	Is that the best I can do literally just shield and hope I can get frickin whackin
30046860	30048860	I'm scared
30052300	30054300	Huh
30054540	30056940	Okay, there's champions in the four rooms

30094460	30096460	All right
30096940	30100220	If I apologize, I do apologize for any rage
30101820	30103820	Against two enemies
30108940	30111500	Well, I'm cornered right now. I'm gonna be honest. I'm cornered
30117260	30121180	Okay, these guys maybe because they swing they leave themselves open a bit more
30121980	30126780	No length the other way and now we've just lost our ability to
30128060	30129180	Uh

30132300	30135420	Hams to the best of us link. Oh, sorry. I'll put that on

30143100	30145100	Strangely well all things considered
30145820	30149180	Uh, I think we're just gonna do the same tactic where we just
30149660	30154540	Do that and get the fairies out so I can shoot at least
30156780	30158780	Thank you, darling
30159980	30164460	I'm getting formed so literally guys. Why aren't you here to carry me? So what happens if I go up?

30221660	30223660	Yeah, thank god it wasn't wait
30224940	30230060	There's a platform there, right? I'm uh heal up fully because I like being able to shoot from my weasel or my
30231900	30236380	Um, sorry if it is tedious, but it's the only way I know how to play game
30238380	30240380	Oh my god, I can't believe it
30240380	30242220	A gamer that's bad at games
30242220	30243740	Saying so
30243740	30248540	I will not go kind of like so carry me home. Oh, I never sung that during the time
30253660	30258780	That would take me outside the castle, why would I want to go outside the castle at this point in time?
30258860	30260860	A shortcut
30270060	30272060	Oh wait, hold on hold on hold on

30307020	30314220	Okay, okay, that's not bad. That's not bad. That's that's handle-able handle-able
30315900	30319260	Instant loss. No, no, no instant loss. I'm good. I promise
30320220	30323900	Fortunately, I'm not full health so I can't deal with all these
30324460	30326780	Enemies. Thank god. I've been playing Isaac

31172780	31178940	I'm most laid-back customer in the world probably because I was a waitress and like I mean I fucked up. It's just happened
31180220	31181660	um
31181660	31184940	You know, I've never had anyone be I'm gonna report you to your boss or whatever

31217340	31222140	My place doesn't get scotland getting americanized. Do you guys ever watch beard meets food?
31222140	31228300	It's this guy that eats like a stupid amount of food and he travels to america to make his content
31228700	31233900	Because america has such large portions that are like good for sensationalizing in his videos
31237260	31240540	He's like I'm going to america again
31241660	31244780	I'm going to america again. I'm doing a tour of america

31286140	31287820	um
31287820	31289740	and uh
31289740	31293100	But apparently street vendors are like a lot more popular

32362860	32364860	Uh
32366380	32369980	No, I do not think the puny sword will save me but
32370620	32372620	Does it mean I'm not that I suck them up
32373420	32375420	I don't suck them up

32389260	32394940	All right, let's just spin. Let's just clear up the map. Let's just clear up the map so we don't really have any issues
32396860	32401820	What's the dealio? What's the plan? What's the deal? What's the plan? I don't know

32592620	32595660	Uh, right. I can see what one we're supposed to hit next
32596780	32601100	Oh, oh dear unfortunately, um, I'm just gonna clear the map if
32602220	32609580	Because it's getting a bit crowded and that is currently stuck to the right side and I actually need to shoot something on the right side

32697820	32699820	Because that was very cringey
32700780	32701900	Um

32703020	32707420	I really don't want vati to be on that side of me when I spawn. Yes. That's what I did
32713420	32715420	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
32717020	32725180	What what is this madness? I have the power of a god. I haven't stoppable mate. How can I lose to a literal child?
32726140	32729980	There you go. Let's not be a just out here. Okay, children have a lot of potential

32775660	32780460	No, the castle's collapsing. It's too dangerous here quickly. We must escape from the castle
32782220	32785580	Oh my god, I think we actually did do it. Wait for real for real. We did it first try
32786140	32789740	Hmm. The door is blocked. We have no choice head back to the sanctuary

32997420	33002380	Oh my god, it's a deflect. It's a deflect. I can see it. I can see the attack pattern. It's a deflect
33004460	33006460	Oh lord

33012540	33016060	Not if you're gonna do that yet. That was so unlucky
33017100	33019100	Because of that attack phase. I couldn't do it
33020380	33022380	Again with this attack
33028220	33032140	Oh, I cannot press that button any harder if I tried
33037100	33039100	I don't I don't know what to do
33039820	33041820	Okay, that's fine
33045420	33050860	Oh, why why why I'm point blank, you know, I'm point blank. You're a wee liar

33060300	33065020	Absolute shit for brains who knew exactly what I'm not I can't do it because I'm gonna get hit by that electrode
33069260	33073660	I didn't even call it a boss battle for nothing
33090060	33092060	Oh no, I'm not ready
33093020	33095020	But I don't have to be
33095020	33097020	I don't have to be first try
33097500	33100940	Fool but I the light forced my power. I had such power
33102380	33104380	Did we do it first try?
33106700	33109980	Actual gg or real gg like real gg
33111740	33116300	Real gg the hat has returned real gg real gg
33120780	33122780	Real gg
33123740	33125740	Link thank goodness you're safe
33126620	33132700	You defeated body. You're so brave, but we've lost so much the castle all those people
33133740	33137420	Not any worry about it. No, I try my best any worry about it
33137820	33139820	Ah
33147900	33153340	What's this the curse defeating batty seems to have broken the curse he cast upon me
33155180	33163660	Allow me to introduce myself to you princess Zelda. My name is Ezwo master of minish lore and sorcery
33164620	33171180	The mages cap was my creation, but it's limitless power has caused nothing but trouble for your kind
33172780	33175500	Is there any way that you can forgive me?
33176540	33180700	I know many have fallen and much of the castle has been destroyed
33181580	33184060	But it is too soon to give in to despair
33185100	33189820	The curse on me is broken and Zelda still possesses some of the light force
33190700	33194060	Perhaps together we can do something to make things right
33197260	33200060	Focus focus through that piece on your focus
33201900	33205420	If one sorry if one wears
33206300	33211580	If one with a just heart wears this cap things can be made right again
33212540	33216060	Princess Zelda let your wishes be made real
33220060	33222700	I was gonna say focus focus through the pizza on your princess
33229740	33234320	I wish to restore oh life as it once was
33250140	33254140	Oh no troublemakers on the road
33263740	33265740	I'll have peaceful
33267340	33269340	And always restored in the world
33270860	33275820	Look the castle all the people who had been turned to stone. They're all back to normal
33280540	33284300	The hat it's fallen apart. It's overflowing with the power of life
33285020	33288380	The hat has the power to turn the thoughts of its wearer into reality
33288940	33293420	Vati's heart was filled with evil and that was reflected in what he became
33294940	33301340	But it seems that Zelda's pure heart coupled with the hat's power has created a miracle
33302140	33304140	Oh
33304540	33306540	The portal is closing
33306620	33309420	Hmm. It looks like the time for us to part has come
33310140	33314940	The mini store opens but once every century and soon it must close
33315980	33319580	I must leave you both now and return to my homeland
33320620	33322860	I know I have caused you much suffering
33323420	33325820	But the evil one's power has withered
33326540	33330700	The power of princess Zelda herself has restored the light to Hyrule
33331740	33337660	Well Link my journey with you has been exciting to say the least
33338620	33343100	In fact, I'm more than just a little sad that we most part ways now
33345420	33347420	Please accept this
33351660	33353660	Oh, but it's not as low
33354540	33367020	You know, I've never actually seen you wear in a cap until now. It suits you little hero. Take care
33369420	33371180	Bye
33371180	33374460	Thank you for the advice. Oh god. You're so tiny. Please be careful. I thought
33375420	33377420	Bye buddy
33377740	33380300	Farewell farewell my friend
33381260	33383260	That's crazy small
33391820	33397500	There he is a proud boy link we did it
33400060	33402060	We did it
33402780	33404780	He's
33405740	33410300	Yeah, I don't know how big this team was but Matt hats off to this team
33410460	33414460	The only thing they messed up on was in my opinion
33416380	33417500	Was
33417500	33419500	The ending should remain
33419580	33425660	But I'm gonna show you something if I put up the game again. He's so small. He's five two. Whoa. Is there anyone?
33426700	33434140	And now we only have 40 more games left in the timeline. Wait, there's 40 installments of Zelda. No way
33435660	33441740	That's off. Yeah, okay. Actually, I didn't mean that hats off to the development team
33449180	33451180	Sad thing, yes
33451980	33453980	Broly legend
33453980	33455980	You did amazing
33456140	33459660	Thank you. Love you. Love you. Timmy's playing
33459660	33466700	Is it like 15 mainline games? I did not know there was that many installments
33469420	33475260	I know ocarina of time is rated very highly I believe. Oh my god. That's what they look like
33476540	33483020	They have like a little feather tail. Oh my god gen two. What the fuck they're called picori gen two confirmed
33483580	33485980	Little red and green inspiration little gold
33486940	33495180	I'm here for a little adorable tail just yonking it straight from your nintendo. Thanks. I don't even have to think
33498460	33499820	Hmm
33499820	33506860	I can't believe I didn't mess that up. I thought I was gonna be in for a rage fest like replaying over and over again
33507820	33513100	Oh, that's what that looks like sauce, but that looks like a chick. I'm sorry. That's like an emo chick
33513900	33515900	But a gen two confirmed
33517100	33521900	Original Zelda staff. Oh, this is a special thank you to the original
33523900	33527900	Management nose take product management
33529900	33536220	Are you shouting at? Oh my god. Link's taking it on the chin as Eslo shouts at him. That's adorable
33536220	33539420	Link, what did you think doing making us jump in that whirlwind?
33540380	33549100	Oh my god, that's such a cool friggin art that puts it into perspective how absolutely terrifying it is to be a picori
33551900	33553900	Gender bent batty confirmed into
33555660	33558380	Oh my god, that's such cool artwork. Oh
33559340	33561500	And here we are with all our elements
33562380	33565180	Dusted links quest come to an end
33565660	33570940	But surely this is not the end of Zelda and Link's adventures in Hyrule
33571980	33573980	The legend will continue
33577180	33581100	As long as the power of light force echoes throughout the ages
33582460	33586620	Oh, there's a wee picori bottom right if you see him next to the fire element
33588300	33590300	Hold on as we clover
33591420	33593420	All right, ah fuck off
33593420	33595420	And then get bent
33597820	33604380	Oh my god save absolutely save because that was a lot of progress not to save please save
33607340	33609900	What this is a real what are you talking about this is a game boy van
33610460	33614220	So this is the only what it's a real game boy van
33615660	33617660	This is my only thing
33618220	33622220	Wait, I have a triangle on my name. Why do I have triangle?
33624220	33631340	Yeah, this is the only thing if you complete the game but come back everything is still wrong
33631980	33634700	It's like it's as if you didn't do it
33635420	33640780	Which is such a shame. It means you won. Imagine the game Christianina. Yeah, like I
33642140	33645820	Now don't get me wrong for the explore. I don't I don't even know how I got there
33646540	33651740	For the exploring side of things I completely get leaving the monsters in the game
33652540	33654540	But I don't like it
33654540	33656460	The post game could have
33656460	33661580	Could have been much better in my opinion the post game should be the kingdom is restored
33661980	33667020	And you know make up some plot line where like oh linky need to you know get rid of the stragglers type thing
33667100	33670460	And maybe like kill all the monsters in the world and they perma stay away
33671260	33672780	um
33672780	33675740	It's too dangerous go home. Yeah, like everything's shut down
33676460	33679180	No, that's why we like did all that exploring
33679980	33686620	Um before because like everything gets all changed like the world is now permanently changed. We can't get to like pre
33687740	33689020	this
33689020	33690140	I think
33690140	33693580	Breath of the wind and thingy did that. I could be remembering what wrong
33695580	33699500	Yeah post games elder could be fun, but they've just never done it like don't get me wrong
33699660	33703580	If the development team like it a certain way they like it a certain way. That's fine
33704620	33706220	um
33706220	33712540	But I have to admit for a player that especially is enthralled with a zelda series like this could have been
33714540	33716540	This could have been a lot more fun
33718700	33723580	Um a legend of zelda god that postman did that leap even I can't leap hold on
33723900	33725900	How do you even I can?
33726540	33728540	um, but yeah, there's like
33728620	33732300	The only thing now really is we could just do code stone trading
33732540	33733740	and
33733740	33735580	Kinstone, but
33735580	33737580	You know is what it is
33737900	33742460	Closest you get is a password in the oracle game for the other game that implies you saved
33743260	33745260	the other land first
33748140	33750140	Um
33750940	33755660	But yeah, like it's just such a shame like how it all is as a mayor here
33756620	33760300	Monsters are coming everyone's standers. Oh that doesn't apply to you my boy link go get them
33760700	33762700	You're your sword and braver. You'll save the day
33765100	33770780	Um, yeah, it's such a shame because I think the post game could have been a lot more pretty like especially this in the situation
33771180	33774540	Being all alone is uh, well lonely. I'm going to find myself a nice home too
33777100	33779100	Um
33779260	33781260	There's extra dungeon bosses
33783180	33789580	Hey, wait, wait, wait for me. Um, but yeah, unfortunately, this is where it's like, uh, I really wish they didn't do that
33791260	33796700	And but it's the development team's choice, but for me as a player
33800060	33803100	Hi there, welcome. Sure. I'll take a rest. Um
33804700	33811340	Wait, I'll take the 200 room, please and three girls to come in that'd be great. Thanks. Enjoy your stay
33814460	33817180	Oh wait, we actually just straight up like stayed in a hotel
33817580	33819580	Oh
33819980	33823900	Well, yeah, I think we did it right. We should probably uh redirect into mercy. Hold on a minute
33824460	33827580	We should uh redirect into mercy because uh, there's nothing else I can do
33828060	33833980	Now I can get 100 but I honestly don't know what I'm missing and uh, we'd be at it for quite a while
33835260	33838620	And I'm not really fussed for it because I have kind of corrupted the fail
33839420	33841420	I've not corrupted it, but
33841580	33846860	The fail is now stuck in this like things are blocked off everyone go home dialogue
33846860	33851660	Which isn't that fun whereas like when you start the game everyone's like welcome to town
33852220	33854220	Town love all that jazz
33854220	33856220	But now it's like I'm messed up
33856940	33859260	You know what we'll go home and we'll see grandpa
33860460	33866620	Oh wait, he doesn't know that we've defeated fatty. Oh, no one knows we've defeated fatty. We can't even tell him
33866860	33868860	Oh
33868940	33870060	Oh, well
33870060	33876780	I'm so good. Yeah, it's just the same dialogue. Which is a shame that fail should have been us three girls come with a 400 room
33876860	33878860	I got 400
33878860	33880860	and but yeah
33881500	33885660	It's slow is on our head again type thing because we haven't done it
33886380	33891500	It's just a complete time loop. Which is such a shame. I I definitely think it could have been
33892460	33897260	A very adorable game if they did it right, I will make sure we're redirecting into mercy
33899340	33901820	Should I pick any kind of support?
33906380	33908380	Oh, she's playing death mark
33909900	33914140	What what's the what's the question she says the title of the stream is do you have the red stuff?
33915100	33918220	What's the red stuff the blue you got the blue?
33918220	33920220	I
33920460	33924940	Right, I'm gonna see if I can put me clapping a some more up
33925500	33928140	I'm probably not gonna do it right now because I think it's a bad time to do it
33929420	33931420	Where is my mercy?
33933580	33934860	See
33934860	33936860	redirecting to mercy
33937180	33942060	But we did it. Thank you so so much for letting me turn a four hour stream into
33942940	33946860	Nine and a half hours. Wow. Holy crap. It took me that long to piss off about
33948300	33952940	How did I do that? Honestly, I freaking I just I'll just stream for a wee bit
33953580	33957020	um tomorrow's streaming experience is
33957580	33965980	Only a few hours of old-school runescape. I'm gonna go hard on the wine because I have my first collab with none other
33967020	33968780	The mercy modis
33968780	33970780	We're gonna play hong kong gifts game
33971420	33977980	And we're gonna see what an earth goes on. Wow. We really endurance that I didn't even mean to like it was just like a little
33978380	33980380	Oopsie. Whoopsie
33980860	33985820	Thank you for showing us the minish cap. Oh, I'm so glad you could enjoy it for the first time if you've never seen it before
33985900	33987900	It's just a cute little pixel game
33988460	33992940	I think it's a very sweet game. Definitely if they had post games, I feel more fun
33993020	33996700	But that's just me. Thank you so so much my little reeflings
33996780	34001580	Um, I'll go talk in mercy stream for a wee bit because I don't know what on earth what kind of game she's playing
34001660	34004620	But might as well watch it wee bit might as well watch it a wee bit
34005260	34006540	um
34006540	34011980	But thank you so so much billet reeflings. I'm so sorry to endurance you again and again night after night day after day
34012140	34014140	I just can't help it. Okay. I need a lot of you
34014860	34017900	And and I'll get a lot of you one way or another. Okay
34019020	34021900	Right. Thank you so so much. I love you
34022140	34027260	Please look after yourself and get a good stretch and a good water and a good sleeping because that was a
34028460	34030460	A longer stream yet. It was a long stream
34031180	34035740	Okay, we will redirect successfully into none other than mercy modis and we will be nice
34036300	34042860	And we will be respectful because remember I'm a fiend for the ink, but you know, you got everyone has their different licks
34042940	34046700	Okay, and mercy now might not be at the same lick as me. Okay
34047660	34050780	All right. Thank you so so much. I'll see you tomorrow on rinse cable cable
