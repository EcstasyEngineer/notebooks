1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, Flix. When you came and you gave me a dinner, are you coming, are you there?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mommy, please come back. Mommy's here.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello? Right.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We've got an agendation today.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Cause I done fucked up.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I need, I needed more time and I might stop my time.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But that's okay, cause look.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I got a cup of safe.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, there we go. Oh, sorry that was really loud for no reason.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you hear me? Mommy's here.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll be glad to stop you again.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll be glad.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As always, please do not listen to this at full volume. I will make mistakes.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, you might notice something. You're still naked in the background.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will deal with you. Okay?

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And there's an echo over Flix's head.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is there actually an echo?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is there? Is there an echo?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I'm, oh, you're debating nasty of us.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm already late for monstery and you're debating at a time like this.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't hear. Good. Okay.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's what I did with my knees. Can you see them?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It is a little, a little part.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, and I'm from a secondary one. Ah.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to...

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to do this.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Make it a nice, what?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do not put full volume on me, don't you?

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Right, so here's the problem.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're naked. This is the problem.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've not put clothes on you yet, so I need to do that, like, right now.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right this very second.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right, put some clothes on.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we're going to do that first. I'm just going to check how much you can see.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If I crouch right here.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay. And then, if I bring you over,

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I put you in the bath because you smelled of plastic.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay. Look, this is you.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to do ASMR on you very shortly, but I just need to set

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
these things up, okay? Just need to cover up this.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Put some clothes on you.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll pop you right there.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's what you sound like.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to put some bulk serenade on you.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The problem is, this makes me really, really loud.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hold on.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't want to get a similar.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't look in high detail.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, your experience. Not the airway.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, for those of you who don't know, this

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is a chiropractor's doll.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay?

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But it comes anatomically correct for a reefling.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, there's something here that I can't show you.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So I'm going to put paper boxers on you.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So we're going to do this right now.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Just as one would imagine how you do it.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to start with the front.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh no, my square.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, I'm covering up your no-no square.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, this is a bit too big.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to fold it in half.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm changing your diaper.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh no, I can't.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I saw it. You better not have.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So what I'm going to do

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
is, see like you're even holding it.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh my God, welcome to the massage parlour sir. It's $5 for the special end.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Really, it's more than I fucking know what I'm going to be doing next morning.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I mean it really is. So we're going to put tape around the front part

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and then we're going to do the back as well. Okay, you'll have the end done.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll dab you right out on your...

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So we're just taking a little bit of tape.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Also, I apologise if I sound really tired.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I took sleep medication but only slept 5 hours so it's still in my system.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Alright, don't look at your cheeks. Your cheeks are very

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
well-cheeked up. So we're just going to tape this part.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, maybe you're allowed to see your cheeks a little bit.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We are packing, you are. I need to cover you up.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're double-cheeked up on a Thursday afternoon.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I remember just something. Yes, unfortunately I was a bit busy

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
dealing with some things but a fantastic news for the reeflings.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I've been very selfish

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and the third

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
edder is being a batch for me.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Which is YouTube content.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, so know that you're looking a bit more presentable.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hi.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Very presentable.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm now going to cover up your butt.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because y'all have booties and maxims. This is too glues maxims.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
See, this is what I'm supposed to do

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
before the ASMR stream started. Now I'm just pretending it's ASMR.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm just talking to you regularly levels across the room.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I felt that sping.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The point of this ASMR stream is some people get this

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I forget the word. It will come to me later. But some people

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
get this thing where if I touch the doll, you'll feel it. Like where I'm

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
touching the doll. I'm going to muck about with that. I'm going to put my fake nails on as well

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't worry, I'm going to put real nails on. Not my...

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I still have the manicure sitting on my nails.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You feel that sympathetic reaction.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Something like that. He has a hole.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh my god, you can see that? Oh shit, you saw.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Look, I had to get him atomic.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
For what? For my needs and the reeflings needs.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't know you could even fucking see that detail on the webcam.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What else can you see on the webcam?

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The beach of her nails for you ASMR.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Very accurate.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It has only taken 5 minutes and 18 seconds for you to turn it into ASMR.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm just absolutely pathetic at ASMR.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Live ASMR is just an absolute

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
atrocious thing for me because I just get to yapping on another shot.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Actually, I'm going to put your box of nails on.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Actually, I'm going to do something controversial.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
ASMR to yapping stream speed drawn

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
80%. Thank you.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going to cover up your derriere like so.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is what I should have been doing but instead I made a cup of tea.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll wake up shortly. Don't worry, I'm going to wake up shortly.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It just takes me a moment to...

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, there you go. My god, now you're really getting covered up.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Give us a G string.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Cup of tea sounds like a great idea if you want to be me and the fellow brush.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Speaking of brush, I might have a brush call up coming up.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, one pulls cup. But I think she's going to bring it.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've got some prettyish kind of ones with an English go.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I wanted them with an honorary stop.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And the other one's called a string.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right, we've done that mission of getting me shut up.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to put the paper away next.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because what I'm going to do...

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh thank god, oh my god, I thought you could see my...

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
my stuff from last night.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Before I went to sleep. Oh god, my knees are sore.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They're all red.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can we get a hat? Oh my god, I forgot about your... I need to do your hat. Hold on.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I need to do your...

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
your addiction to me.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Your nicotine patch.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Sorry, that was really loud. Like, it's not ASMR.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't know why we're pretending anymore. It's not real ASMR.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to do your nicotine patch.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hey, what the fuck is in my tea? No, there's something in my tea.

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can you see that?

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Did I use my fingers to get it out like a weirdo?

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't have a spoon.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you see the wee thing? That bit? That's something that's not supposed to be there.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think it's a fiber of... it's a little fly. No, it's a fiber of my cloth.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How am I going to make an amal to be?

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Amal to use my fingers or do I need to go get a freaking... what is it? It's just a bit of fiber of cloth.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's like my hoodie, like for example.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sorry. Yeah, use fingers, alright.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's what I missed.

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Did I get it? You're going to drink the tea off my fingers?

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank god I didn't have my fake fingers on for that, are you joking?

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh my god, the tea's warm. It's delicious.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas.

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, I'm going to put your nicotine patch. You have a patch on the right side of your...

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
like if I'm looking at you, it's on the right side.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's where your nicotine patch sits.

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And it is in a square shape.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Kind of. Well, it is a square shape, not kind of.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm just guessing shapes up here.

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So that's it there.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I just have to over...

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Sorry, I keep forgetting where the camera's pointing.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I need to make myself smaller, maybe.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But this one just goes right here. But first thing we're going to do...

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
we're going to color it the correct color because it's got

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
like a tan kind of band-aid

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
tinge to it. And then that's you.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is how we keep up with each other.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Through a nicotine patch.

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Which I already need as of late.

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, it's a marker. Yeah.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
These kind of markers are for the skin. I can write on myself if you want.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you want to write me, I'll write something on myself.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I'm just going to stick here.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't want to drop too much.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Stick your little nicotine patch on your head.

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then it's official you.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So you just want to catch a little bit.

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You don't need to catch the whole thing.

187
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Just stick on your head. Oh look, it's a leaflet.

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There you are. Do you want me to draw on your boxers or anything?

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh god, are you tinting through the piece of paper?

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Naughty refling. Don't tint through the piece of paper.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But now this is a lower-accurate refling.

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I like to do all the ASMRs.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So next I'm going to put my fake nails on.

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because these nails, these ain't going to cut it for the ASMR that I want to do with you.

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So I'm literally just grabbing

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
my mini nails.

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I actually haven't read the instructions so we're going to go...

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh no, that's for my shock collar. Don't need the instructions for that.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come here.

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh it's cell type. Everyone's going to know that I inked myself.

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Right, so we're going to be wearing these.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
These are Lego.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh sorry, that was so loud right next to the microphone.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Sit on him. Your wish was my fucking command, did you Jones?

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Alright, let me just put you there refling. Okay, let me just go do something.

206
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Now that I have done my task, I need to see...

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh sorry, refling.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Sit on your own, you're okay baby.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're okay darling.

211
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, let me see if we're going to figure out how to put these on.

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So these are fake nails and you just stick them on

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
via this glue.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So, wish me luck. Okay, sorry, I'm going to do it behind my screen.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're winning. God, I wish I was that lucky.

216
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, I literally bought a little ball so I could roll play with you. No, that doesn't make me weird.

217
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I love it here.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, I'm going to finish my teeth because look, it's getting smaller.

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm learning about

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
my teeth. Now you can blend in at this sleepover.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're like, why did I get invited to this?

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay, I finished my teeth.

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was never finished my teeth in town.

224
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm opening the package.

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, that's a lot.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh my god, alcohol. Oh my god, you didn't tell me

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that you drank alcohol, Mifun.

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, you feel everything.

229
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What are the alcohol wipes for?

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What's this for? Oh my god, I have a spear.

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Mifun, you better listen

232
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to all of my instructions or else.

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why does it give me a spear? It must be to pick off the nail.

234
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It must be. I do not believe.

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god, we're such girls together.

236
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh my god, we're real girls.

237
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's to shank your enemies with. Pretty shy coming out.

238
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh my god, we're such girls.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this. I'm just here for the fun time.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay, right, so nail blowing.

241
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
For external use only, avoid contact with eyes.

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In the unlikely event of irritation, please discontinue use.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Ingredients, ethanol 2, cyanol, alcohol 8,

244
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
polyethylene, like polymethyl, meth.

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh my god, why is there meth in my nail glue?

246
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What next, man? Is the alcohol for the baby to take care of?

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What, to prepare? Oh, to prepare the surface?

248
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why no? Oh my god, 75% alcohol.

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm getting steam in tonight, Lance.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Jesse, we need to cook. What's inside? Oh my god, I've just finished my

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
KFC, by the way. A little lemon.

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh. Fuck it stinks.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay, if this means I'm preparing all right.

254
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right, that's right. Time to get drunk.

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Keep drinking, Nathan. Keep drinking.

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Good boy, just keep drinking. You can crash at my place tonight, good boy.

257
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hahaha.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, you saw it, you saw it, Maryse was the yander.

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're coming back home with me.

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, where did it go? Okay, great, I've put alcohol everywhere.

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll try. And now, we're going to watch...

263
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Can I sit on you while I do this? Or can you just go there for now?

264
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We need to be super careful when we do this, because this

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
will stick these on very harshly, okay?

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, piss, who do you...

267
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, shit, sorry.

268
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hello?

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Are you coming in? Are you scared?

270
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, sorry, it's one of them open mechanics.

271
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sorry, they never, wait.

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Is this not one of those lids that open itself?

273
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't, I can't find the tip. The tip is sealed over.

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No, please.

275
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This is gonna, how did I get in?

276
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Do I cut your tip, yes or no?

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Answer me right now, do I cut the tip? Spin it.

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The, the glue? What do you mean, spin it?

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Spin this?

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't know what you mean by spin it.

281
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't cut it. I want me to cover it.

282
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't spear the tip, there's nothing to spear.

283
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Your tip is so, like, tiny.

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Sorry, I know my tracking keeps getting lost

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
every two seconds, it's because I need to look up.

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Surely this is what I needed to do.

288
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I label it, thank you for coming on me.

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
See, told you it's not pre-recorded. It's an average size tip. I don't know if that worked.

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh my god, that's it.

291
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's getting trolled, sorry. Circumcision ASMR.

292
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, should I saw?

293
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That worked.

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, okay, everyone stay calm.

295
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Cam, everyone stay calm. This is gonna work.

296
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I just, okay, okay, so that's the thumb.

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, shit. I wasn't prepared, I wasn't ready.

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay, so you literally put a dab of gold, of gold, of glue.

299
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And then you place down the fake nail.

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then you just hold it.

301
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay, that's what I wanted to do.

302
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No more interest to spear, that's what I wanted to do. And then you just gotta

303
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
push, push, push, push, push. Gold where?

304
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No, push, push, push, push, push.

305
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, is it even sticking?

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

307
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, if it doesn't stick the first time, just add a wee bit more.

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Did I, would the alcohol nullify the glue?

309
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, I'm just being dumb, sure.

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Again, push, push, push, push, push.

311
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm using the clear.

312
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Okay, okay, again some.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's not, well,

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
hmm.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Hold on, this is definitely user error.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because this place had far too many good reviews.

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They really used their error. They had far too many good reviews.

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
For my dumb ass.

319
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, I don't want to jinx it.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It doesn't want to look like me.

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Anywho.

322
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Right.

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay, I think I'm doing it. And then try on your toes.

324
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I ain't got no toes, chief.

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
My toes went to France. They died in a fire.

326
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A great fire of London Bridge.

327
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Okay, we're literally just doing the exact same thing. We're caking it in glue.

328
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We're attaching it.

329
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We're attaching it.

330
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Uh-huh.

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh my god.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh my god, don't talk to me unless you're this big.

333
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Okay.

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh my god, look, my personality is changing in 4K because I stuck some nails on.

335
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Slee, honestly though.

336
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This nail set is a sleigh. It's Mermaid inspired. That's why I picked it.

337
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh my god, I'm such a...

338
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh my god, look. Watch this sleigh.

339
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Oh my god.

340
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I guess I'm out.

341
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Mommy has become a queen. Alex Gray. Yeah, you like that?

342
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Are you ready for me to touch you with your nails?

343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

344
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I know this may come as a surprise to some of you, but

345
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not much of a girl and girl.

346
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I said it. I said the truth. I'm not much of a girl and girl.

347
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So when I do something like this, I feel very feminine.

348
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
All men are men. Cinnamon. Raw cinnamon.

349
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
All men are friends.

350
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh shit, I fucked up the placement on the index finger.

351
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm more of a mean lord than I care what I look like.

352
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Did I say thank you, Elbot, for the membership?

353
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, but it did. I'm a little bit distracted right now.

354
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Anyway, so this is everything that...

355
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh my god, I just broke a nail.

356
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Am I covered in... can I touch this or not?

357
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I did broke a nail. I can't believe it.

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh my god, I'm gonna make it.

359
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Is that what spear is for? It must be to take off the nail.

360
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Right, we're adding more glue. Okay, let's retry that again.

361
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Rip now. God, this is taking forever.

362
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Bro, the stream hasn't even started. It's been 25 minutes now.

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay, I'm just glad you guys like spending time with me because I'm so bad at this.

364
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is terrible.

365
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Take that, you old shit. Oh, Mercy hasn't... no.

366
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
A.C. has a new short out if you haven't seen it.

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I also tagged Azura's short because I didn't know she even did that kind of stuff on stream.

368
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So if you're bored waiting for me to stick nails on myself, you can literally just watch Azura's

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
little short right now. Okay, same thing though.

370
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We'll put a little bit glue. And then we stick her on.

371
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then I think I've completed the first set of my nails.

372
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh my god. Are you ready?

373
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You're broken now. You're just like one of the girls.

374
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh my god. Tell me you do not want me to give you

375
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
head pads right now. Imagine my nails going through your scalp.

376
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They're actually so cute.

377
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm such a girl though.

378
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm actually such a female. I'm such an XX.

379
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh shit, you can't see them. Right, let's do that again. Let's go again.

380
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay, this is even harder because this hand is covered in nails and this hand isn't.

381
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This is harder than one made to see.

382
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Oh Jesus. God, these nails are long. I bought a short on purpose.

383
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
On purpose. Sorry, the color is purple so my brain said purple.

384
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you coming? Oh my god, please tell me this hasn't closed up already.

385
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh, there you go. See it? Oh sorry, I keep...

386
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's all wet. It's all wet.

387
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And then I'm going to have to put the glue down. Oh my god.

388
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I can't do both things at once. Okay, I'm going to stick my nail on.

389
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Spread the glue around a little bit. I do have C-shaped nails

390
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
which are... what do you mean?

391
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Message deleted by Vealer Moderator? Wait, is that real?

392
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Did you mean that?

393
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Did you mean to ban the Super Chat?

394
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I look up and the message is gone.

395
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
No KFC, stream until the nails come off.

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh my god.

397
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Thank you the Vealer Moderator. Do a Valley Girl accent.

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh my god.

399
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Sorry, I don't know why Valley Girl in my head just means

400
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
equals mourning. Message included.

401
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Get blasted out of this one. Have you played Disco Silent?

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't know. I don't know what it is. What, is it related to nails?

403
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Oh my god, the Elden Ring Spiders.

404
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The fucking creepy enemies in Elden Ring.

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Terrifying.

406
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Sorry, I picked glue on them.

407
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sorry, my voice is going already. It appears I have not

408
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
rested enough. But that's okay. I'm just happy to be here.

409
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Tell us, I've blinged on our sling, Jesus.

410
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Do you mean I've blinged on the refunds?

411
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay, dude. Put some glue on the thing.

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Can you shoot magic though?

413
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Just squirt and count? I'm fucking with you. I'm so sorry.

414
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Please don't listen to me. I am not well rested.

415
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I have no filler. Can I have your nails?

416
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You can buy them on Nailsuses if you want them.

417
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Or do you mean you want my used leftover

418
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
nails? That's different.

419
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I did not put enough glue on this.

420
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm crying, throwing up. There wasn't enough glue.

421
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
God, this is actually a lot harder than a...

422
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Ooh, sugar. Space and everything. Nice. That's far too much.

423
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That nail's not coming off for centuries. Hold on.

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh my god, I've just noticed

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
my inking. Oh for fuck's sake.

426
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I've actually just noticed my inking thing is literally on my desk

427
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
right now. I'm so sorry.

428
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I hope that doesn't look too short.

429
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Take some of that off. It is? I forgot to put it away.

430
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Holy... I don't even want it here.

431
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Okay, there we go. Put that one on.

432
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It is much better. Can we see it?

433
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Absolutely not. It is illegal.

434
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh my god, I'm such a girl.

435
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You know I'm a real girl when I put love hearts on myself.

436
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh yeah, you hear that ASMR?

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh yeah, you're like...

438
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm such a female.

439
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay, three more to go.

440
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh yeah.

441
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That was a hard one.

442
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Could you imagine if I was like that?

443
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Did you see that? That was fine.

444
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You got the nails to work.

445
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm such a special girl.

446
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
More like special dudes.

447
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay, middle finger.

448
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm a Barbie girl.

449
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I'm a Barbie man. Wrapping plastic.

450
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's fantastic. You can brush my hair.

451
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And trace me everywhere.

452
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Imagination. Life is your creation.

453
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Come on, pop it. Let's go party.

454
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Come on, pop it. Let's go party.

455
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm a ginger and green girl. And I'm a fan.

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's not even a real country actually.

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Sorry, you've been fooled. Scotland isn't a real country. It's actually just a tourist trap of England.

458
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sorry that you fell for it.

459
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm sorry you had to find it this way as well. Actually, Scotland isn't real.

460
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh for fuck's sake, I can't get it. Oh my god, it won't come off.

461
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They've got like a sticky tag to keep them down.

462
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Oh, I already knew that one.

463
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Scotland is actually real as a hyal.

464
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's not ginger. It's one.

465
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Ask the sauce. Amy, I love you. I love you the whole face.

466
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Amy, why did you think you were wearing it to ginger? Please, allow me.

467
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And for anyone else that's like, Amy's not ginger. Amy wasn't ginger until she changed her model color.

468
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
She's clearly, mmm, well known as orange.

469
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay, orange is ginger.

470
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Orange is ginger.

471
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Orange. Sorry, that was really low praise.

472
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Last one.

473
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sorry, I just need to get the figurine out of the way because the last thing I want is any accidents.

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Oh, my nail just came off.

475
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Okay, my nail just went flying off. Reflowness is all your fault.

476
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is all your fault.

477
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay, let's try it again.

478
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay, we have two nails.

479
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We need to go again.

480
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That was a wild and inappropriate ASMR award poster.

481
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, that stopped. Do you remember when those

482
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
awards happened? And the people that were selected

483
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
didn't even make ASMR roleplays. I remember

484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
learning about that and I was like, damn,

485
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you almost look in trouble. Does Amy mean

486
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
ginger have anything to do with the self-piped meme about ginger? Oh, no, no.

487
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's nothing to do with that. Amy was created

488
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in my image. I knew I wanted a emot or

489
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
because it's my number one.

490
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So she was made in my image. They were all made in my image.

491
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Some things that interest me. She views

492
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
a slight exception because she was crafted in someone else's image. However,

493
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I did actually. I had the final say on everyone so

494
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
if you've got a problem

495
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
with any of the girl's designs,

496
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
shove up your arse because I love them all.

497
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You should have done this with the design.

498
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No. No, I shouldn't have.

499
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay, can you hear that squeaking?

500
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That's my thumb.

501
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
There's like air moving trapped.

502
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay, I think I may have done it.

503
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Hold on. Shhh.

504
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Okay, real ASMR.

505
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Shhh.

506
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Shhh.

507
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Shhh.

508
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Shhh.

509
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Shhh.

510
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh my god, real ASMR.

511
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And it only took me

512
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
30 minutes to get here.

513
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Ripped fondle.

514
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, shit.

515
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh, yeah.

516
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Can tap on the remote all power.

517
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Shhh.

518
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I want to put you there.

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, Riflin, what happened?

520
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Riflin, that wasn't very say so of you.

521
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
What's going on here? Is that because I sat on you?

522
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Riflin, is that because I sat on you?

523
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What happened?

524
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Danny, you put another piece of paper on you.

525
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I need to.

526
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
He got me shoved up. Fucking clearly.

527
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh my god, your winky's are worse.

528
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Hold on, let me get a piece of paper.

529
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I guess I'm not done setting up your outfit yet.

530
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Sorry, I really like it.

531
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh fuck.

532
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think a bit of glue got stuck to the scissors.

533
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Something tells me a bit of glue sucks.

534
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I want to put a lid on the fucking glue.

535
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
This is so dangerous.

536
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You're going in the bag of shame. How do you?

537
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's a completely natural reaction.

538
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Okay, I won't shame you for that.

539
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We're just going to give you a little bit more padding.

540
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If that's okay with you.

541
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
If I cut, there's definitely glue on the scissors.

542
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Where's the cell tape?

543
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Can I get cell tape with these nails on?

544
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Where the fuck is my nail?

545
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Where's my nail?

546
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
When did that come off?

547
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Hello?

548
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Where's my nail?

549
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Are you joking?

550
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Hello?

551
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I've lost my nail. It's gone to France.

552
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's just gone. I ate it.

553
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
How did I miss something that's that big?

554
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You can see the glue that's sitting on it.

555
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I've got your nail. I wouldn't even dirt it.

556
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Well, I mean, at least I can get the cell tape super easily now.

557
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You ain't the nail client. Target the client.

558
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Turn around and let us check.

559
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Turn around and lift the camera.

560
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Okay.

561
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
As you can see, the cell tape is ruined.

562
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The cell tape.

563
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The cell tape is gone.

564
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh, I'm sure it'll show up somewhere.

565
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay, Reefland, time to give you some modesty back.

566
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Because this is a bit outrageous behaviour.

567
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You can't even be cutting about like this on a live stream. Do you understand?

568
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Okay, good Reefland, good boy.

569
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Wait, sorry. Yeah, very good boy.

570
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Should I make my V-tuber smaller?

571
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Now you have those two nails for this V-tuber thing?

572
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh, that's like real Andrew.

573
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I can make myself smaller if I'm kind of getting on the way too much of that action shot.

574
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You lost it when putting it in the plastic bag.

575
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What? No way!

576
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Reefland, you're so right. We found it. Thank you, Reefland.

577
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What the fuck? Crowned that mannequin right now.

578
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
How on earth did you fucking catch that?

579
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's literally in the bag.

580
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Nice catch. Oh, I pulled it.

581
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Don't you hate from the hook?

582
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Should I pick that off? Sorry.

583
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Sorry, sorry if you saw my face. Oh my god, I look like an average person.

584
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh my god. Right, for the billions of time I'm putting

585
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
so much glue, there's no way that this can

586
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
viably come off, okay?

587
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh god, I can smell that. And then we'll dry it a little bit.

588
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And that means...

589
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Okay, there. I have a full set of nails on.

590
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Sonny's not an animal? I can't believe that.

591
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That was so well spotted. Honestly, I can't believe we did that.

592
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It definitely cannot come off.

593
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay, it only took us 41 minutes

594
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but I'm ready for the ASMR, okay? And I hope you

595
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
are equally ready for the ASMR. What I'm going to do is I'm going to make my VTuber model

596
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
a wee bit smaller. Not like

597
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
insane smaller but just a little bit off to the side, you know?

598
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm not actually bringing the camera over here.

599
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Sorry, let me re-calibrate real quick, okay?

600
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh my god, I can't fucking touch it. How the fuck the girls wear nails?

601
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Like,

602
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
in the most respectful way, I've got video games to play.

603
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I've got vermin tight to fuck around on, okay?

604
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know how you girls are doing it, right? How is the best angle?

605
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You would have thought I would have figured out a better angle but I didn't. Okay.

606
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So, mine's too weak.

607
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
One. I'm just going to start my face, okay?

608
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Wait, hold on. One minute.

609
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The microphone behind the webcam.

610
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This is a bit better directionally as I put you on the crinkliest

611
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
packets possible.

612
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Excuse me. I'm just moving something around

613
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
for you, baby. Okay, there you go.

614
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Are you ready for your massage? Good. If you slate me a fiver, you'll get a happy end.

615
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That's how it works around these parts.

616
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Okay.

617
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I can just

618
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
touch your forehead.

619
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't know if it's loud enough. Maybe I need to put the

620
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
webcam on my legs. Sorry. The webcam.

621
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No.

622
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If I'm bringing you up, are you going to see the stuff in the background?

623
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Just a little bit. Don't look in the background.

624
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'm plenty happy. Thank you, boy.

625
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Pay up. Thank you.

626
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Just so you can see both things.

627
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Do you take payments in internal organs? I could be, isn't it?

628
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Can you kid me?

629
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
If you're a bird sleeping outside the window, that's because there's a bird sleeping outside the window.

630
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay.

631
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I can probably pick it up.

632
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm walking up again.

633
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Thank you, daughter.

634
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Shh.

635
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Maybe start with your hands, actually.

636
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Give your fingers a little squeeze.

637
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Hmm?

638
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Hmm?

639
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Did you... I don't know if you... for anyone

640
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
a bird of your... because round and round the garden

641
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
like a teddy bear, one step, two

642
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
step all the way there and you get a little tickle, tickle.

643
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
On your armpit, tickle, tickle, tickle.

644
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That could take my finger.

645
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And trace up your arm.

646
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
That's your radius and ulna.

647
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
These bones are actually quite interesting

648
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
because they twist perfectly.

649
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So if you think of your bone structure in your forearm, the radius and ulna,

650
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
they twist very easily with the tomato wrist.

651
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That's really interesting. I like it.

652
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You got your radius and ulna here

653
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and your wrist.

654
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And the wrist has the most

655
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
intricate bones in the body and your feet.

656
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's like the second most intricate

657
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
for the amount of little bones you've got. But the wrists, because the wrists are so

658
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
versatile, they need to be able to

659
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
do a lot, especially if you consider our evolution.

660
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They need to be able to...

661
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You can see the silence behind it, actually.

662
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You can see all these tendons, these bones, these veins.

663
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's all very intricate.

664
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm going to go up past your radius and ulna. And we hit your

665
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
biceps and your triceps.

666
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Back here. Please ignore Gimli running around the house.

667
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
If you heard that.

668
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Then you come up to your shoulder.

669
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's called the clavicle.

670
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The collar bone.

671
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The collar bone that goes here.

672
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Then the area between your neck and your collar bone.

673
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It's called decliatage.

674
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And it's straight up stone from French.

675
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's a decliatage area.

676
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Do you want to see how I take this?

677
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And your pectoral muscles on your chest.

678
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Is it your pectoral muscles?

679
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But you might often hear them refer to as pecs.

680
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If you see male body builders,

681
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
they might be quite pronounced.

682
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Sorry, I messed up a little bit.

683
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
They might be quite pronounced.

684
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
That's perfectly natural. It's just biology.

685
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Especially in female body builders, you can actually see the definition of the pectoral muscles

686
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
versus the chest fat, if you will.

687
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then we go down to your rib cage.

688
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
If you want to think of your abdomen,

689
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
your rib cage comes two thirds down to here.

690
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Rib cage.

691
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You can actually feel where your rib cage ends.

692
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
If you set up, you can feel it right now against you.

693
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You can feel exactly where your rib cage ends.

694
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You can feel exactly where your rib cage ends.

695
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Around this part.

696
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Some people can be born with a lower rib cage or a wider rib cage.

697
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's okay. It's perfectly natural.

698
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Not everyone's going to come out like a textbook mannequin.

699
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Then as we go further down your stomach.

700
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You've got your tummy area, your digestive tract.

701
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
We also have your hip bones.

702
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Because you are a man,

703
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
you have a V shape that naturally forms in this area.

704
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It comes a harsh V.

705
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That happens at puberty, believe it or not.

706
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This V shape should form.

707
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
As for your hips.

708
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Your hips should not store too much fat.

709
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Normally what happens when a male stores fat

710
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
is it will go to his stomach first.

711
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Believe it or not, you're gluteus maximus.

712
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Have you ever heard of women

713
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
being annoyed that men have a nicer

714
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
rump naturally?

715
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Because when women store fat, the reason behind that is for pregnancy

716
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
to make sure there's resources for the child.

717
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But men, since they can get impregnable.

718
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You put it in your badonkadonk and you put it in your lovely tummy

719
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and then it will equally distribute through your body.

720
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Where's women?

721
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It will unequally distribute.

722
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Which is quite normal, please don't be embarrassed if you have cellulite.

723
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But for women, normally the storage

724
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
especially in a pouch.

725
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I just called it a pouch these days.

726
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I'd show you mine but I'm not wearing anything.

727
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Which will stick out a little bit.

728
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Some women have their womb sticks out.

729
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Believe it or not, you can have a womb that sticks out, not just the stomach fat.

730
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That's quite interesting on the back.

731
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
As you go past down your hips, you come to the femur.

732
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The bone that's in your thighs

733
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
is called the femur.

734
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Do you want to know what happens in the femur?

735
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That lovely magic happens in the femur.

736
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Your blood is produced.

737
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The femur is very efficient at restocking your blood supply.

738
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Do you want the bad news?

739
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If you break your femur, you are in danger.

740
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So let's not be breaking femurs.

741
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Let's not be becoming a statistic.

742
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
As long as I can have you.

743
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Thank you at the end of the day.

744
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yes, you can absolutely bleed out if you break your femur.

745
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So let's not be breaking femurs.

746
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
If you get drunk on a night out and your friends are there, you need to jump off the high high.

747
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
You got no, sorry.

748
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Femur hardly even know where.

749
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And then you go past your thighs.

750
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And you go kneecaps.

751
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So when you are born, my little leaflin,

752
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
when you came straight out of my womb, because obviously I birthed you and I was pregnant by you,

753
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
your kneecaps had not fused yet.

754
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You were born with the

755
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
different bones that you need for your kneecaps.

756
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But they do not fuse until the six month mark

757
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
through ossification.

758
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
The ossification is the terminology for when bones are done.

759
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Your little kneecaps came in at six months.

760
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Lord of Storms, thank you.

761
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So whenever you see mothers like, oh my child didn't start

762
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
doing this at this milestone or whatever.

763
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Sometimes everyone's different.

764
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Some babies can completely skip the crawling stage.

765
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
They can just walk in overnight.

766
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And if you go past your knees,

767
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
we have your lovely calf muscles, which

768
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
now this is where we talk about blood flow.

769
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So capillaries from your heart.

770
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So their heart will pump through arteries, oxygenated blood.

771
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So pump, all through your body.

772
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And it's got quite a distance to go when it gets down to your legs.

773
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Big distance, okay?

774
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So pump through your arteries and then oxygenates

775
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
all the muscles and everything that needs oxygen.

776
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But how do we prevent the

777
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
oxygenated blood while it travels back to your heart through blood fresher?

778
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
How do we stop it from accidentally going backwards?

779
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Well there's this thing called back flow valves,

780
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
okay? So think of a tube.

781
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And then it only allows a one way because there's actually a hidden mechanic.

782
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So every time your heart pumps, it opens up and pushes the blood

783
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and it goes pew, pew, pew.

784
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And because it closes,

785
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
that prevents any back flow of deoxygenated blood.

786
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Because if your arteries started going backwards

787
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and your veins started going backwards, we're in trouble.

788
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Your body works its hardest to keep you in check

789
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and keep you nice and healthy.

790
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And the easiest way to engage this,

791
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to help pump the blood back to the heart up here,

792
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
is engaging your muscles. So you don't want to tell you, oh, get up.

793
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
There's a very easy way that you can actually

794
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
engage your calf muscles. I can show you if you want.

795
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
These are your calf muscles.

796
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Because this is the furthest away from your heart,

797
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
you need to take good care of your legies. That's why walking is so bad.

798
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And taking the calf.

799
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Are you a nursing student? Nope, I'm uneducated.

800
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I just like looking at YouTube videos about biology.

801
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I can show you. So this is how you

802
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
do your calf muscles, okay? Are you ready?

803
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Literally, this looks so simple

804
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
on paper, but this is so good for your calf muscles. Just

805
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
stand with your feet together, and then go up when you tip your toes,

806
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and then, and up, and then, and up, and then, and up, and then, and up, and then,

807
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and up, and then. Really good for your blood flow.

808
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Really, really good for your blood flow. That's it. That's what you have to do.

809
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And then that's,

810
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
whenever I say, oh, great, get up, brief ones, everyone get up.

811
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm gonna go get a break. That's what you should be doing.

812
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's your calf muscles down here.

813
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Is it tibia and fibia down here? Or am I making that up?

814
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Radius and ulna. Tibia and fibia?

815
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Hmm, not sure I'm getting that one.

816
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And then your feet. Very intricate. So

817
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
if you like to consume alcohol, you know what to do. You know what to do. Refling.

818
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Don't consume too much, because alcohol is poison.

819
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life. Okay?

820
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's how your feet, you can get this condition

821
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
called gout, believe it or not, and gout.

822
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Gout just is a disorder

823
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
caused by alcohol, which makes your feet incredibly painful.

824
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Incredibly, incredibly painful.

825
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And if you go to the doctor about it, they prescribe you painkillers,

826
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and they'll give you a little leaflet that says,

827
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
stop drinking as much alcohol.

828
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But you're allowed to, you can have a magic brew, a magic potion every once so often,

829
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
but don't do it to harm yourself, do it to have good time.

830
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yep, I've broken those bones. It's tibia and fibia.

831
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Oh, I remember. I thought it was a disease

832
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
for pirates. Oh no, no, gout is if you have alcohol

833
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
at the same time. I think if it also have a red meat diet,

834
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
you should be careful if you have too much red meat. She says,

835
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
gout is actually the name of the song Shadows of the Moon.

836
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That's scurvy. Yeah, scurvy is when you don't eat fruit and veg.

837
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But your toes, got five cute little toes.

838
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
There's, you won't believe this.

839
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But polydactyl people are among us, okay?

840
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
No, I'm not polydactyl. Polydactyl means you were born

841
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
with extra fingies and toes, okay?

842
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It's actually a lot more common than you think. You would never know.

843
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Unless someone confessed it to you. But normally if it's on the hands,

844
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
it gets removed. Well, I've got green on my fingers from the love heart.

845
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Oops, sorry if you see green. I'm turning into Shrek.

846
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But yes, if someone is born with polydactyl

847
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
on their hands, normally it's like an extra pinky here. And they get surgically

848
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
removed. But if it's polydactyl, is that a painting of Isaac reference?

849
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Real answer. And then,

850
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
little toesies. If it happens

851
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
on the feet, most parents actually don't bother.

852
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
They're removing it. I'm getting used to removing it if it's on your toes either.

853
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I have two nails on one of my toes. What does that make me?

854
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Not polydactyl. Polydactyl is definitely when there's an extra

855
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
ligament or something. If it's an extra nail, I think that's just a

856
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
misinput. It's a misinput.

857
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It evens most of your body.

858
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Polydactyl is a

859
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
polyamorous pair of dactyl.

860
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Yeah, that's your body reference.

861
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Now, as for male attribute things

862
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
about the body, other than this line,

863
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I'm not sure what a good thing is. Oh, I've not done your head, have I?

864
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Silly me, I forgot. So we went up to your

865
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
your decliatage.

866
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Touching on your neck and showing your ears. You must protect

867
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
your ears, okay? Especially if you're a concert goer

868
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
must put in earphones or else I'm going to be upset.

869
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You need to put in little earplugs to protect you from music because it's far too

870
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
wind. Far, far too much.

871
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm gonna go and give you a little head scratch.

872
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Have you ever? Well, this is my

873
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
theory about ASMR, by the way. I really enjoy ASMR.

874
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I thoroughly enjoy ASMR. I think

875
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
ASMR is related

876
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
both to our evolutionary instincts

877
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
for bonding and also what we were raised

878
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
like, okay? So, now, if you think,

879
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
wait, wait, wait, wait, back then. Now, don't laugh, don't laugh, because I'm saying monkeys, but

880
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
you know how monkeys grew each other? Well, this shows companionship,

881
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
this shows admiration, love, it strengthens bonds

882
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and monkeys are more likely to share food among each other,

883
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
among us. And I

884
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
think that trait of companionship and of

885
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
altruism has persisted through the

886
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
missing link and we've ended up with it as well.

887
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And that is why it feels so so nice and someone

888
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
please if you're here, for example.

889
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And I think it's natural that we humans

890
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
also have this missing trait

891
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and that's what makes it so good and

892
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
succinctly to get that kind of one-on-one

893
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
attention. And

894
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
they also do it to groom the bugs that are

895
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
over here, but thankfully we no longer have to do that.

896
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And

897
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
but yes, it helps to socialize

898
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and all that. And I think ASMR is a good outlet

899
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
or I'm biased towards ASMR, I think it's a good tip for

900
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
what you need, because sometimes you just need a little bit

901
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
of encouragement, a bit of reassurance, because

902
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
you know, we're all just doing life at the same time for the

903
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
first time. Like this is the first time we've played this video game, not gonna lie.

904
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Sometimes it's hard mode. Sometimes you

905
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
thought the game would be easier and it's still on hard mode

906
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and if you get 20 minutes of pee

907
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
then yeah.

908
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's my theory about ASMR. It's kind of left

909
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
over and also like if your

910
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
mum touched you into bed, for example, played with your

911
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
hair and

912
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
that kind of thing could translate, because some people don't get tingles at all, but some

913
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
people are like so success, but like I could touch your cheeks right now

914
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I mean.

915
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
There's some people like really

916
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
fast ASMR.

917
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah, for those of you

918
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
who can feel

919
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
that transfer ting

920
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm worried that the need for positive affirmations

921
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
can lead to narcissism. No, I don't think so.

922
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I get the pain too, you're getting too human, but

923
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
from not to sound arrogant, but from what I make

924
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I try and make the positive affirmations. You know the hips being touched

925
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
a little bit. You are gonna hear the paper

926
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I'll probably see if I can get the image right.

927
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
This is nothing to do with what you're saying, but I'm going

928
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
failing for the first time. I've got to show up with a boat and less than an hour.

929
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Do you need to pack a sandwich and stuff? Make sure you put deodorant

930
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
on and have lots of fun sailing and be super safe.

931
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Wear a life jacket and don't panic.

932
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Panic is what leads to death. Not that you're gonna die. Have fun

933
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
last rabbit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know what to say.

934
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Don't flip.

935
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's okay if you're busy, you don't have to stay.

936
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You've got to get stuff done.

937
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Don't just tap on the video.

938
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I think if you're a narcissist

939
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
it probably would have developed. I don't

940
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
think anime girl on internet would make it develop.

941
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
You think I'd make a great mother?

942
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Well, the reflins call me mome. I'd like to think I'm their mome

943
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
if that's not weird of me.

944
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I love my little reflins.

945
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I give them all the attention

946
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
when you get home after work.

947
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I give you shoulders a little massage to try and de-stress you.

948
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And then you'd be like, what's for dinner, Stroni?

949
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And I'll be like chicken again, because I like chicken a lot.

950
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I give you those shoulders a little massage.

951
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I squeeze down on your thighs.

952
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
No, don't try steps. These are traps. These are called traps.

953
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I can't remember the full name of the muscle trap.

954
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Trapezoids?

955
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That sounds like a square.

956
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I think of you as mome-wave.

957
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Mome-wave. Do you want dinner or a bath?

958
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Or maybe me.

959
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh, I said the reflin. Do you want dinner?

960
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
A bath?

961
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Or me?

962
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'd put you in the bath and I'd scrub you there

963
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and get you all clean. I feed you.

964
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And then this part. The voodoo doll is kicking it.

965
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I go for some fish.

966
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The voodoo.

967
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay, so you get home. And obviously I greet you at the door.

968
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And I go read one.

969
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But you're all dirty and tired from work.

970
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Oh wait, no. You need to go for your post-work poopy. Go to the toilet.

971
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Go to the toilet for 30 minutes after work.

972
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And then you have a bath on your phone. I know how it works.

973
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And while you go poopy, I will fill up a nice warm bath for you.

974
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And I'll put bubble bath in it. Because, okay, this is a girl.

975
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
This is a girl only fact, if you didn't know.

976
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Lush came out with Minecraft themed

977
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
bath bombs and stuff. So I'll get you a Minecraft themed bath bombs.

978
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And

979
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
are these two separate baths? Yeah.

980
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I would not run a bath while you were taking a shit in the same room.

981
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm not going to be inhaling those fumes, okay? Thank you for the offer.

982
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Let me inhale those fumes to check your digestive tract.

983
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That was a really kind offer though. Thank you.

984
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
That was too kind. Please don't ever cook again.

985
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And then when you get out of your post-work poopy

986
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
put you in the bath and then

987
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
wash down your back for you and put you in the back.

988
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And get a wee cloth and I'll wash down all the bits that are really hard to wash.

989
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So I'll start washing your neck

990
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
and then I'll go over your shoulders with just some soap and a cloth.

991
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.

992
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And then you tell me about your day

993
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and you see work was the same as always.

994
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And I say, damn, that sucks.

995
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But I'm just listening

996
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
to you because it's good to listen to you.

997
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And I ask how you feel when you tell me your time and I know it's okay.

998
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And then the water, you hear the water trickling down.

999
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It trickles down your back. When I get the cloth and I ring it out

1000
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
it goes

1001
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.

1002
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
There you go.

1003
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And then I do a little bit down the back of your arms as well

1004
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
because it's not the only way.

1005
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.

1006
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Then your arms.

1007
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They're just over there. I need to go grab them. They're like right over there.

1008
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Scrub down here.

1009
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And then when you finish in the bath,

1010
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
actually no, I'll let you cook in the bath and then I'll go finish it in.

1011
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Then when you're ready, you get a nice home hearty meal

1012
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and obviously it's going to be chicken and carrots and

1013
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
potato because it's my favorite. I like that kind of stuff.

1014
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Stewie, kingdom meals, or like mashed potato and chicken

1015
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and like carrot. I just really like carrot

1016
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
and mashed potato and chicken.

1017
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It's my dream to eat it every single night.

1018
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But I can't because I have an iron deficiency.

1019
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Can I be the dinner? No, no, you have to eat first.

1020
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I need to fill your tummy because that, oops, sorry, my cheer disc.

1021
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I need to fill your tongue tongue. And then it gets

1022
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
big and round because you're digested. And then I touch over

1023
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
your tummy. And then that's what the floor plays for me.

1024
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Can I get some cult urine from inside?

1025
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm the dessert. Okay. And then once

1026
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
you're all full,

1027
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'll get you to lay down in the bed so I can start an ASMR session on you.

1028
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I'm going to pop you down. And then when I put you down in the bed

1029
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
for the ASMR session, look at you go.

1030
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And then I go read something.

1031
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Are you ready for your ASMR session? But, but, but.

1032
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And you say yes. And I say good.

1033
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Okay. I'm growing some ASMR tools.

1034
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm just picking up my ASMR tools.

1035
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Okay. Now this time, are you actually ready for your ASMR session?

1036
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Now you say yes.

1037
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Mommy, Ashley, can you help yourself? You started it. I'm just ending it.

1038
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Okay. Geez, it was your fault. I'm blaming you.

1039
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Okay. I'm going to put that in.

1040
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And then I'm going to...

1041
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
quiet. Okay.

1042
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Okay. Now I'm going to put that in the middle.

1043
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1044
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And then I'm going to bring you closer. Hold on.

1045
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I need to check because I'm not strong enough to push it.

1046
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I'm not going to lie to you.

1047
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
There's nothing terrible stuff I'm going to do.

1048
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I'm not strong enough for this. Hold on.

1049
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I know my nails coming off.

1050
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I know I lost a nail from you.

1051
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Okay. I lost a nail. Hold on. We lost one.

1052
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Let me put it back on.

1053
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Okay. I'm strong.

1054
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Sit on it. Sit on it.

1055
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I mean, yeah, I'm sure. Sorry. I don't want to cast on the shadow.

1056
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Let me stand a little to the left like the head video game.

1057
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Sorry, my voice is dying.

1058
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Okay.

1059
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
One.

1060
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So it's really hard to do.

1061
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
This is not easy.

1062
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Okay.

1063
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Okay.

1064
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I already made the audio. I just need to upload it.

1065
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I literally made an audio of me sitting on the microphone. Over and over and over and over and over.

1066
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
How much to be the doll? You are the doll.

1067
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Look at me. I even got you a new little nicotine patch.

1068
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Please call me a good boy.

1069
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
You're such a good boy.

1070
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Okay.

1071
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
What's going on?

1072
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
What's going on?

1073
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I mean, what's the deal?

1074
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
What's going on?

1075
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I need my ball. It's not staying.

1076
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Stay.

1077
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm not going to play.

1078
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I should be.

1079
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I should be. Sorry.

1080
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It's dangerous to go alone.

1081
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I'm trying to stick this on.

1082
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
You might take interest in trying to stick it in there.

1083
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
It wasn't long ago.

1084
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Is it unique to be called a good boy written in mummy issues?

1085
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
No. You are allowed to crave things such as being praised.

1086
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Being told that you're genuinely doing a good job.

1087
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I think it kind of comes into that.

1088
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Sorry to put my tinfoil hat on. I'm literally...

1089
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
To make it better, I will twerk once I explain.

1090
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I think it's perfectly normal

1091
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
to seek out attention.

1092
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Positive reinforcement.

1093
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm not kidding. I'll start twerking to keep your attention to talk through this book.

1094
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I like to use things.

1095
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It takes like 40 minutes, but one.

1096
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
All your praising is just amazing. Thank you.

1097
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Literally, it is perfectly natural

1098
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
to want to be praised and to want to be told

1099
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
you're doing a good job and that you're literally

1100
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
doing fantastic. I don't know what the problem is.

1101
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's fine. It's natural.

1102
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's perfect.

1103
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You shouldn't be embarrassed about it either because think about it like your childhood.

1104
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You're told, oh, good boy. You're so creative. You're doing fantastic.

1105
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Keep it up. Check out you. And then boom.

1106
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Then boom. What happens?

1107
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Nothing. You get absolutely successful. You wonder you crave it.

1108
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You literally had this thing for many a year and then all of a sudden you turn a random age

1109
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and you don't get it anymore. Of course you're going to crave it. It's perfectly natural.

1110
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Was that flossing? No, no. This is flossing.

1111
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Hold on. Pause the ASMR. I'm here to do the foot movements.

1112
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Oh, shit. How did I do that? Oh, there we go.

1113
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Oh, you can't see it. We're going to have to do the fucking crutch.

1114
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
No, it was that one.

1115
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
It's all right. Back to your ASMR.

1116
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Come here, patient zero.

1117
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Come here. Can I push this chair back?

1118
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That's the hate one.

1119
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Sorry. This chair can go back.

1120
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm not strong enough. Oh, my God.

1121
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Okay, that's going to have to do. Did I even achieve anything?

1122
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I didn't. Well, don't face that.

1123
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
That didn't work. Okay.

1124
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Patient zero.

1125
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Put the microphone here and pray that it doesn't fall.

1126
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Just because it doesn't fall.

1127
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Okay.

1128
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
If I can pull this off, I'll be it.

1129
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Hold on. I'm going to go for that.

1130
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I need to, like, go on my right.

1131
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Okay, I'm going to pull that way for now.

1132
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Okay.

1133
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I'm going to fix you.

1134
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Oh, my God, you can't tingle so hard, right now.

1135
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Little bad.

1136
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
She just sat on us over here.

1137
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And she tingled under my blanket.

1138
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Mannequin.

1139
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I've already played.

1140
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Heart drop moment. Wait, what did I do?

1141
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Where did you get the mannequin? I taped

1142
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
in Cairo Practor model.

1143
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And it was the best that I could do.

1144
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I'm tingling you.

1145
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Okay.

1146
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Okay.

1147
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
My heart drops whenever

1148
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
some says face and something

1149
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
is conditioned.

1150
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Okay.

1151
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
My chest.

1152
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Oh, my head.

1153
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Oh, this is looking good.

1154
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
She just kidnapped the reef and made him into a model.

1155
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Looks like a weird ritual.

1156
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It is.

1157
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
So if you're hearing the brushy brushy brush.

1158
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Oh, I wonder if I can do this.

1159
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Oh, my God.

1160
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Right, is this going to work?

1161
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Five hands.

1162
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Okay.

1163
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
This might work.

1164
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Okay.

1165
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Okay.

1166
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Are you joking?

1167
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Okay.

1168
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Okay.

1169
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
What do you want me to do?

1170
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
If you look at you there,

1171
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
it probably does.

1172
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I will put them below.

1173
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Is it the wrong ear?

1174
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
No, it's Shaisa.

1175
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I didn't think that far.

1176
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
This is the wrong ear.

1177
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'm going to do this.

1178
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Oops.

1179
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Just flip this over.

1180
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Or if I do it all at the same time.

1181
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Oh, you mean like this?

1182
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Wait, is that going to work?

1183
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Why am I being dumb?

1184
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's very problematic.

1185
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Face down, face up.

1186
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
No, it's not.

1187
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That hurt.

1188
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
You know what else is going to hurt?

1189
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I'm going to sit on your hand.

1190
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I'm going to do this.

1191
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I think I can do that with my huge tip.

1192
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Hold on.

1193
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I want to move in his voice so much.

1194
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I just dropped the stuff down.

1195
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Sorry if you saw that.

1196
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Okay.

1197
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
We're gonna do some ear cleaning.

1198
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Her legs are so thick.

1199
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I have like the fucking hidden baby faces in my arms.

1200
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Okay.

1201
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So I have a hand.

1202
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Okay.

1203
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
You listen to the big daddy audio?

1204
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I was trying so hard to talk and we're getting in the wrong way.

1205
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I definitely am going to record like an actual video to this year.

1206
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And I'll dub in like all the sound effects.

1207
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I think that would be quite nice.

1208
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Okay.

1209
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Can I go to the other side to sort of ruin the leg thing?

1210
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I don't know.

1211
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh no.

1212
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
This is fine.

1213
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
This is the most I've ever learned on an ASMR video.

1214
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I wish I could teach you more about the body.

1215
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
But I can't really remember anything else off the top of my head.

1216
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Like I didn't research any of that.

1217
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That was just knowledge inside me.

1218
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
The story is so painful.

1219
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Can you feel?

1220
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I'm like milked.

1221
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Or in the wise words is she be caught and boom.

1222
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I'm like so we're milked.

1223
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I actually hate she be.

1224
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I've never forgotten.

1225
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
That's the fun that's gone.

1226
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Do you want to teach your education?

1227
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Okay, I can do more education.

1228
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm awful about viruses, if you know.

1229
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I can do it real quickly.

1230
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You're not feeling so good.

1231
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So this is wrong.

1232
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Unfortunately, I only have one of these.

1233
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
This tingle effect doesn't work.

1234
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Oh, I can put like...

1235
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Can I put like tape scopes on with snails like this?

1236
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Who knows what that sounds like?

1237
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Let's tell Reflinge.

1238
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You're in the testing...

1239
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
You're in the ACP testing facility.

1240
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
This is ACP, so I know.

1241
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That's my name.

1242
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Everything is supposed to be fine.

1243
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
The visually is perfect.

1244
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Mummy, nurse, will you open it?

1245
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Hmm, this nails a bit too much for you.

1246
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
This is...

1247
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Okay.

1248
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Will we attempt the latex scopes?

1249
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I will attempt them for your upcoming...

1250
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I hope you've been eating your tomatoes, Reflinge.

1251
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Okay, so this is what's going to happen.

1252
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I'm going to go for a P exam, okay?

1253
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
You will be put into our room,

1254
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
and you'll be asked to take care of this thing off.

1255
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
You can keep your shirt on if you really want, okay?

1256
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And you'll be asked a few questions, okay?

1257
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So the questions are going to be...

1258
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
How is your P full?

1259
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Do you notice that your P...

1260
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Sorry, I'm in your P stage, so I'll be facing you.

1261
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
So you'll be asked, is your P full okay?

1262
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Do you have any concerns?

1263
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Do you have any discomfort when you're pain?

1264
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Have you noticed that you tinkle a little,

1265
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
even when you have more in your bladder, okay?

1266
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And then you'll answer all these questions.

1267
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And then the assistant, nurse, will leave the room.

1268
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
And you'll be asked the strip down.

1269
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Just take it off from the bottom down.

1270
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So you can keep your socks on.

1271
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Maybe not your shoes on the table,

1272
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
but they'll have a sheet of paper for you.

1273
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And then you'll be asked to go in your safe.

1274
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And then put your knees up a little bit, okay?

1275
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And this is how you determine

1276
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
if you've been eating enough tomatoes and not refilling, okay?

1277
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
This is how I'm going to do it when I come and meet you, right?

1278
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Take a bit of it, the one you think of.

1279
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Try and find it, you need to relax.

1280
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Relax, relax, let me in, okay?

1281
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then you'll determine if it's enlarged

1282
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
or not your truthful answers

1283
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
and all that jazz would mean that.

1284
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And then once you've been a good boy,

1285
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
that's basically how it goes online.

1286
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's not a yell.

1287
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's not that.

1288
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It's not going to hurt.

1289
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It shouldn't hurt, okay?

1290
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
That sounds a little easy.

1291
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah, basically that's what I'm going to do.

1292
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And then do that.

1293
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And then you'll get treatment based on results.

1294
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So you can do more experiments, can't you?

1295
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I can play with you all night.

1296
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Okay.

1297
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And I'm going to sit down with you

1298
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
because I'm getting a little bit talented.

1299
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm starting up because I'm a tired baby.

1300
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Okay, come here, baby.

1301
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It's my proof that I'm a sickly chicken pox,

1302
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
so I need to keep latex poxing.

1303
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Oh, hold on.

1304
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
The back of my chair's not...

1305
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That was really loud and unnecessarily loud.

1306
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I'm so sorry.

1307
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I did not know it was going to make that any noise

1308
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
when I picture it back up.

1309
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Literal gunshots.

1310
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yeah, the back of my chair is now sitting upright again.

1311
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
That was so loud.

1312
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I'm so sorry.

1313
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
That was the back of my chair.

1314
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Please send any grievances to Secret Lab

1315
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
at your next convenience.

1316
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Okay.

1317
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Okay, so now you sit.

1318
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And I need to wear gloves

1319
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
because you've got chicken pox,

1320
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
even though I've had chicken pox before,

1321
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
so I'll be fine.

1322
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
But the thighs are pink.

1323
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I have terrible news,

1324
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
but blood is flowing through these thighs.

1325
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
So-called anarchists,

1326
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
when I touch their pasta,

1327
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
oh my goodness.

1328
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Are the tomatoes supposed to help with that?

1329
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yes.

1330
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So, tomatoes

1331
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
help with your tushis

1332
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
a little prostate in there.

1333
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
But if you're not feeling well,

1334
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
what am I going to do with it?

1335
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I'm going to look after you.

1336
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Oops, sorry.

1337
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
That was really loud.

1338
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I'm here for you.

1339
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Oh, no.

1340
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
You've broken both your hands.

1341
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Big brother.

1342
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I should get Amy to read the Reddit post.

1343
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yes, I will.

1344
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I will do something so cursed like that.

1345
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I'm pretty sure there's a Reddit post about a-

1346
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
was that a brother?

1347
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
He broke his arms or something?

1348
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Oh, no.

1349
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I think it was with his mum.

1350
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Well, we're not doing that.

1351
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I'm here for breakfast.

1352
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm going to hook him.

1353
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It was a son.

1354
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
No.

1355
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Okay.

1356
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Well, we're going to do a little remix.

1357
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Okay?

1358
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
So-

1359
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Oh, no.

1360
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Big brother.

1361
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I'm not trying to steal-

1362
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Oh, wait.

1363
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Should I be big sister?

1364
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Oh, no.

1365
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Little brother.

1366
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
He broke both your wee arms.

1367
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Pretty.

1368
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You can't just bring it up and I'll give you the song.

1369
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I should have just taken like Reddit broken arms story as ridiculous.

1370
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I guess even Reddit-

1371
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Can be based once in a while.

1372
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Brother with the key.

1373
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Yeah, brother with the key.

1374
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
What manga are we talking about?

1375
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Oh, ain't no manga.

1376
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Apparently it's a real life story.

1377
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I don't know.

1378
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Shit.

1379
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I mean, do we believe in it now?

1380
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
All types.

1381
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Rubber gloves.

1382
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Definitely.

1383
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
The tear blister thing.

1384
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And they're starting my arms are broken.

1385
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
This pressure of my kind of little deal.

1386
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Say no more, chief.

1387
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And the script has already been written in my mind.

1388
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Help me fall and I can't do that.

1389
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
So the first, when we find a patient unconscious,

1390
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
remember your ABCs.

1391
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
First airways.

1392
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Okay, there's nothing obstructing your area.

1393
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
B, breathing.

1394
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Perfect.

1395
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
C, I always forget what C is.

1396
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Conscience?

1397
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Cosh?

1398
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Conscience?

1399
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
No, I can't ABC.

1400
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I think it's something to do with blood flow for C.

1401
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I can't remember.

1402
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Circulation.

1403
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Oh my God.

1404
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Circulation.

1405
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Oh God, are you bleeding anywhere?

1406
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Where's your blood going?

1407
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Refling.

1408
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Refling, your blood isn't in your head.

1409
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Where is it?

1410
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Oh, we need to check your body for it.

1411
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
So it's not in your head.

1412
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It's not in your neck.

1413
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Your blood flow isn't in your shoulders.

1414
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Or down your arms, in your hands.

1415
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Or on your chest, your stomach.

1416
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Or your thighs, your calves, your feet.

1417
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Refling.

1418
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Where's your blood flow?

1419
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Refling.

1420
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,000
You need that blood to heal elsewhere.

1421
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,000
To keep pinging the people, not keep people.

1422
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Nurse drawing the hands are broken.

1423
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Oh my prostate is pounding.

1424
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You mean pulsing?

1425
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
What's going on back here?

1426
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
What's all this movement back here?

1427
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
It's just a normal biological reaction.

1428
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I was reading a Reddit story.

1429
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Sorry, I like to bring raw on the Minecraft Reddit stories.

1430
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And it was about guys getting Brazilian waxes.

1431
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
They were called like a manzillion or something like that.

1432
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And they were just like, pochoo, pochoo.

1433
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And then they always get a, a you-know-what.

1434
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And then when they're getting like waxed or whatever.

1435
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I don't know.

1436
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I didn't know that.

1437
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
So much blood flowing in person now.

1438
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
More weight getting flowing.

1439
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
How do you undo brick when you did?

1440
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
What's the quickest way to do?

1441
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Do you want the medical quickest way to get rid of a hard time?

1442
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I can tell you a trick and this is actually used in the medical field in the military.

1443
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,000
If you ever were in a situation where now is not the time and you have the privacy.

1444
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I kid you not, one flick to the tip, it will be gone.

1445
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:34,000
You will have no problems and it will go straight back to regular schmacular size.

1446
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:42,000
This is a real medical thing that is done, especially in the military during assessments.

1447
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
One flick to the tip is gone.

1448
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
You are not going to be tending.

1449
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I can assure you that much.

1450
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Oh.

1451
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
How hard should a flick?

1452
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Do you see?

1453
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
You guys are reacting already to the thought of that situation.

1454
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Can't be too wrong.

1455
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
So like a shotgun.

1456
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I heard doctors hit it with a cold spoon.

1457
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I wish I knew that in high school.

1458
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Clench your thighs and arms to force blood flowing in person.

1459
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I don't know.

1460
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I remember that next time I did it in bloods.

1461
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Jeez, how much of a nurse special interest do you have?

1462
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Guess she'd be to help.

1463
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I think she knows about hidden bits.

1464
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
How does it?

1465
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Oh, okay.

1466
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Flights in your muscles can bring it down, by the way, because of blood flow codes to the muscle.

1467
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I don't know that.

1468
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Pretty much any insurgent forceful impact to the tip drives it into retreat.

1469
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I don't, people won't notice you doing that right before a present.

1470
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Stop.

1471
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
You're about to do a presentation for the company and you're in the corner and you quickly sip.

1472
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I might just go, and then I might put it back up again.

1473
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Holding your breath works as well.

1474
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I'm curious.

1475
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
What did I do if that just makes me...

1476
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
You're not supposed to enjoy it.

1477
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
What are the marks on the mannequin?

1478
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
So this mannequin is actually a chiral-practin.

1479
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Don't ask me a thing about chiral-practin.

1480
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I don't have a clue, but it's basically like all the systems they say, but...

1481
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I don't know what my thoughts are on chiral-practin.

1482
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
From what I've seen it seems faint and deep.

1483
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
So the time I hear a story about it, it's like this person died from chiral-practin.

1484
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
That's a shame.

1485
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
The lips and I'm like, oh.

1486
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
There's a really half-dead thing to do there.

1487
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I mean, how should I do this?

1488
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Actually, I think I've come to, like, acupuncture, yeah.

1489
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Oh, that's right, acupuncture, not chiral-practin.

1490
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
They do the same thing, you know.

1491
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
In terms of schemizing through people that are just in agony,

1492
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
because they've got, like, a trap here.

1493
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I thought I broke my chair there, and I was about to fall off the tape.

1494
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Wait.

1495
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
How did I have the microphone and the mannequin in the shot at the same time?

1496
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I don't know.

1497
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Yeah, there's, like, loads of indents to teach you, like, where the pressure points are.

1498
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'll be damned if I'm letting some stick a fucking needle in me like that, mate.

1499
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I'll be damned if I fall off.

1500
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'm fake.

1501
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Ah, let's go.

1502
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
You do not approach anyone with a needle.

1503
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
All right.

1504
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Need this thing.

1505
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Do you want this?

1506
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah.

1507
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
But yeah, there's, like, a lot of indents.

1508
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Can you hear that?

1509
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I'm trying to quiet so you can hear the indents.

1510
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Something like that.

1511
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
She's touching my hoof.

1512
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I mean, you know.

1513
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Yeah, it's hard if I force you to keep coming back, eventually.

1514
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Especially if you find out how deep we go in the air until she misses me.

1515
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
At acupuncture, of course, relaxing.

1516
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I will do it for free on you, so you stop going,

1517
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,000
because I have heard so many horror stories about acupuncture.

1518
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Like...

1519
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Sorry, you cannot convince me that piercing the skin,

1520
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
damaging your body is somehow going to heal me.

1521
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Well, actually, you might take that back,

1522
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
because I'm pretty sure that's what we've been doing, some medical cases.

1523
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
But you know what?

1524
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That's just medical cases.

1525
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Let me be ignorant, okay?

1526
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I've not done my research on the topic.

1527
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Let me have my ignorant opinion about it.

1528
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Okay?

1529
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Gosh, why does everyone have to be educated just to speak these days?

1530
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Why can't I just be dumb and have a terrible, terrible opinion?

1531
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Well, some medical cases use that.

1532
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
How dare you?

1533
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
How dare you speak the truth?

1534
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You know what?

1535
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
You've frustrated me.

1536
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I'm going to sit on you in a minute.

1537
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I don't think I'm not sitting on this.

1538
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I'm going to come again.

1539
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I can do it like doing an arm as well.

1540
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Obviously, it's quite low quality.

1541
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Get educated.

1542
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Don't try and do something good, then.

1543
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Strongly dimble, roughly, then.

1544
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I mean, right now, because I'm uneducated.

1545
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Where's the mark?

1546
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Or do you want, like, a voice with that?

1547
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
What would a valedict or a Scottish person seem like?

1548
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Oh, my God.

1549
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I had no clue about that.

1550
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Oh, you're so smart, Riflin.

1551
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
How come you care all of this?

1552
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I didn't even remember learning any of that in school.

1553
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
They're such a smartie-pants, honestly.

1554
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It's actually really impressive how smart you are.

1555
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I wish you could, like, talk to me more, like, tonight.

1556
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Like, maybe I come over to your house tonight

1557
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,000
and stay in your bed and you just keep yapping in my ear

1558
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and telling me everything that's going on in the air.

1559
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And, you know, maybe you can teach me a thing or two.

1560
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I don't really care what I'm doing.

1561
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
You know what I mean, Riflin?

1562
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Is that what you want?

1563
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
You want a Bimbo Scottish one, then?

1564
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
School swag needs to be around right.

1565
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
One, that's hilarious.

1566
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Two, stop that.

1567
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Sure, do you like Bionicles?

1568
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Her feminine home.

1569
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Woman with two clothes, pepper spray.

1570
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Yeah, I've been more like Plapping.

1571
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Oh, what's Plapping, Riflin?

1572
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'm sorry, darling, you're gonna have to tell me what Plapping is.

1573
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Can you, like, show me?

1574
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I'm a bit of a visual learner, or, well,

1575
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I'm, like, doing something more than writing it down on paper.

1576
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I'm the brightest you see,

1577
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
so add any, like, writing notes down.

1578
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
So you're just gonna have to tell me.

1579
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Instant most, actually.

1580
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Do not corrupt the woman.

1581
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I'm a tactile learner, yeah.

1582
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
So, are you gonna show me a good time, Riflin?

1583
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Is there a lot of examples in coming?

1584
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Truth, looking my tip right now?

1585
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Stop, that's fine.

1586
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Actually, the paternal and the one who should be the bimbo,

1587
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
because I can't think of a response.

1588
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Oh, what's wrong?

1589
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Did I sound lucky?

1590
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Look, this came out actually.

1591
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I'm trying to make myself sound a bit different than you sound.

1592
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I think I've spoken to you enough in the Scottish accent

1593
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
for you to understand the majority of what I'm saying to you, Riflin.

1594
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
But it's alright if you don't fully understand.

1595
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I don't fully understand a lot of things either.

1596
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
That's why I'm over here, at your house, right now,

1597
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
because I wanna learn more, Riflin,

1598
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
and you're gonna teach me.

1599
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
No, no.

1600
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I locked the door.

1601
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
You're not getting out until you teach me what I wanna know.

1602
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Show me the mail and that and...

1603
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Basically.

1604
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

1605
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Now that we're together, whatever.

1606
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Shh, just take a few hugs with that.

1607
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
You'll be okay. Stop resisting.

1608
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Shh, no, no.

1609
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I'm wearing gloves, so there's no fingerprints left.

1610
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Oh, that's good.

1611
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Oh, look at you.

1612
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Oh, I don't know what to do here.

1613
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Now that you're so defensive...

1614
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I locked the door. I lied already.

1615
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I lied. I didn't wanna play with...

1616
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I didn't wanna build bionicles with you.

1617
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I thought it was a cat, no, it's Gimlin, so I give myself a name.

1618
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I'm gonna give her some attention.

1619
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Gim?

1620
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Gimlin.

1621
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Gimlin, I'm doing ASMR, please.

1622
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Have a hissy fit any other day.

1623
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I'm doing ASMR.

1624
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Gimlin.

1625
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Just tell me you want to spoil it without telling me.

1626
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Gimlin.

1627
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
One second, refunds. We're gonna get a special gift.

1628
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Gimlin, you're fine.

1629
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Here you go.

1630
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
She just walked away from the door.

1631
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Gimlin.

1632
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Here you go.

1633
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Come on.

1634
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Show yourself to the refunds. Come on.

1635
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Here you go. Look.

1636
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Show yourself to the refunds.

1637
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Oh, there's my baby.

1638
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Come up on the chair.

1639
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Come up on the chair.

1640
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
She's like, where the fuck are you wearing gloves?

1641
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Gimlin, come up on the chair.

1642
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Oh, there's a refund on the chair.

1643
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Wait, come here.

1644
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
She's so confused right now.

1645
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
She doesn't know how to do it.

1646
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Come up on the chair, darling.

1647
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Look, it's a refund.

1648
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
No? Okay.

1649
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Wait, so I'll let you in the room for the first breath.

1650
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
You literally run camera for two seconds.

1651
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Come on, I'm trying to make content.

1652
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
How are you? Get on the chair.

1653
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Where's my baby girl?

1654
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Come on, I don't like lifting you up.

1655
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Where's my baby? I think it's the gloves.

1656
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I don't actually like the gloves.

1657
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Wait, you out.

1658
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
And you bear shop and try to do ASMR for the next 10 minutes.

1659
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Do you hear me? 10 minutes.

1660
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Do you understand? See me out.

1661
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
See me out if you understand that I'm doing ASMR for another 10 minutes

1662
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
and you need to be quiet.

1663
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Okay, good girl.

1664
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
That was me.

1665
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
It's the gloves.

1666
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
She doesn't like them.

1667
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I was picking her up but she doesn't like them all.

1668
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
You're torturing her.

1669
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Okay, she understands that

1670
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
there's a 10 minutes.

1671
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Right, Gimli.

1672
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Now that the door's closed, I have pride to say to do what I need to do.

1673
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Oh, my God.

1674
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Oh, shit. I'm spinning.

1675
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I'm not supposed to spin.

1676
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Okay.

1677
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
God, I'm on my finger.

1678
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Come on.

1679
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I don't know.

1680
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Do you like that one?

1681
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
The Clowns.

1682
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Wait, can I do a run and jump Clownslam

1683
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
or is that a terrible idea?

1684
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I mean, all terrible ideas start

1685
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
with a good idea.

1686
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Like a good thing behind it.

1687
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I don't know. Maybe I can do a run and jump one.

1688
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Oh, I can't really tell because of the...

1689
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Do the Clownslam?

1690
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I mean, this is probably...

1691
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Hold on.

1692
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
God, my fucking nails came off.

1693
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Hold on.

1694
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Oh, I glue it one more time.

1695
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Just give me one more time.

1696
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Breathe.

1697
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Okay, hold on. Sorry.

1698
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I'm gluing thin here.

1699
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Please just stay on for the next 10 minutes.

1700
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I'm begging you.

1701
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I'm getting like a proper action jump.

1702
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Sorry.

1703
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Okay.

1704
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
There's no way that isn't enough glue.

1705
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Like, sorry, that finger is running and gluing.

1706
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
There's no way this isn't going to stay.

1707
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I will fucking facilitate this one

1708
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
if that doesn't stop.

1709
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
My tie is going on.

1710
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Screw your sausage. Easy.

1711
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Screw your sausage.

1712
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Right, okay.

1713
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Now that my nails are on,

1714
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I can be very demure.

1715
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Thank you, I bought them.

1716
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
They're mermaid nails.

1717
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Where's the ruler? Come on, get the ruler.

1718
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I know what the people want.

1719
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Here's the nails.

1720
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Here's the nails. Here's the ruler.

1721
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
I mean, if I really wanted to squeeze my fingers down,

1722
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I can literally, like, do that.

1723
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I'm just alone.

1724
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I'm going really smooth.

1725
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Alright, one last climb, Sam.

1726
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Reeflings.

1727
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
How do you confess to your sins?

1728
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Sorry, ignore the trouble in the background.

1729
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
And the Hoover, because the Hoover...

1730
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Reeflings, how do you

1731
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
confess to your sins of

1732
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
inking without my permission?

1733
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Hmm? How do you confess?

1734
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
You plead guilty?

1735
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Oh dear.

1736
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
There's only one punishment

1737
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
for a guilty man like yourself.

1738
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Sorry, I'm standing on paper.

1739
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Okay.

1740
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Does that just jump on you

1741
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
or do I run and jump on you?

1742
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I haven't really thought this far yet.

1743
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Like, because I could, like, literally, like...

1744
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
What? You know, should I just...

1745
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I mean, fuck it, fuck it.

1746
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Like, because I can just...

1747
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
You know.

1748
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Sk sk sk sk.

1749
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
There we go.

1750
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I don't really know if I can

1751
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
do it any other way.

1752
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I'm like...

1753
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I don't even ask how I managed that.

1754
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Can you tell what's happening right now?

1755
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I'm going to break this down, though.

1756
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Hold on.

1757
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Oh, my nail!

1758
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I just snapped my nail on for that.

1759
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
That was the worst that I've ever known.

1760
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Hold on.

1761
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Let me get my nail.

1762
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Okay. Thank you for pleading

1763
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
guilty and

1764
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
confessing to your sins.

1765
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
That's right, get teabagged.

1766
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I'm not even gonna do about it.

1767
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Nothing. I can't do a single thing.

1768
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Right.

1769
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Now, I'm gonna bring my nail over.

1770
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I can't bring it.

1771
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Mommy's an acrobat.

1772
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I have really flexible legs.

1773
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I wish I could show you that.

1774
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I can put them behind my head right now,

1775
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
but I don't think I want to.

1776
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Right, I assume now that

1777
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
there is to take off the nails.

1778
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Cause like...

1779
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Sorry.

1780
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
What's that going to do?

1781
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Assume...

1782
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
where I'm about to climb off.

1783
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I'm gonna do a face

1784
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
stream.

1785
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Oh, wow. It really is.

1786
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
It is to take off the nails.

1787
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Oh, that feels very

1788
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
unnatural.

1789
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Oh, gosh, we're gonna be here for ages.

1790
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I'll try to take these off.

1791
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I'm not quite sure.

1792
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Okay.

1793
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Out of raw curiosity,

1794
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I'm gonna go into the corner of my room.

1795
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I'm not sure I could

1796
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
prove it.

1797
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Like, right now.

1798
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Wait, what was I gonna do?

1799
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I mean, touch my toes and stuff.

1800
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I'm like, go further than my toes.

1801
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You know, like...

1802
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I could do that.

1803
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I had to do it reverse.

1804
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I'm trying to prove I can put my...

1805
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I'm not that smart.

1806
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So I can figure it out.

1807
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I'm not bringing anything away from this.

1808
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Let me take off my nails.

1809
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Yeah.

1810
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I'm just going to stay here.

1811
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I'm just going to go through.

1812
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I heard this bro. It's Johnny Stabby.

1813
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Yeah, I'm Dairy Arc.

1814
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Did you know that you can tell

1815
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
mommy likes you just by her feet

1816
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
if she has them by her ears?

1817
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Oh, you want me to stab one?

1818
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
She...

1819
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
You ain't got to tell me twice.

1820
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
That's right.

1821
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I'll try to take that when you get back.

1822
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Absolutely nothing.

1823
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Absolutely nothing at all.

1824
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Thank you for the

1825
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
kind of membership.

1826
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Okay, can I take this off?

1827
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
This feels really

1828
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
horrible to take off.

1829
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It actually feels like I'm taking the damn thing off.

1830
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
For free?

1831
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Gimli, I can hear you

1832
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
at the door.

1833
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I don't... oh.

1834
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
You see that?

1835
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
It's like glue.

1836
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
It's so sticky.

1837
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Refling.

1838
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
It's so sticky.

1839
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Not by her ears, yours.

1840
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Oh, did I mess it up?

1841
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Sorry, I ruined your joke.

1842
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I'm sorry, bro.

1843
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Thank you.

1844
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Don't play.

1845
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
What is that glue?

1846
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Refling.

1847
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It's so sticky.

1848
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Oh, it's all of my nail as well.

1849
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Refling.

1850
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Good night, Johnny.

1851
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
There's glue on the glue nails.

1852
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I had to glue them on, but I used the face.

1853
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
You know what?

1854
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
You're done.

1855
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
It was like

1856
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
dried up

1857
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
snot

1858
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
or dried up ink.

1859
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Okay, so some of them are coming off.

1860
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
It's so easy.

1861
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I'm de-girlifying myself.

1862
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
That's it, you're getting tomboyed again.

1863
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
You're getting tomboy goth unlocked.

1864
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
You're gonna like it at least.

1865
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Do you understand?

1866
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Oh!

1867
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Oh, that one's really glued on.

1868
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Who put that much?

1869
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Oh, yeah.

1870
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
That felt awful.

1871
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Tomboy art.

1872
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
You're always a tomboy.

1873
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
What was that?

1874
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Always was.

1875
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Wait, you're tomboy starting?

1876
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Wait, you're golf starting?

1877
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Always was.

1878
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Always was.

1879
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
You're very girly at all.

1880
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Right?

1881
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I swear there's probably going to be a Dornathon reward

1882
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
which is like strongly wear a dress

1883
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
because I literally didn't wear a dress.

1884
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
The last time I wore a dress I was out of fucking freedom.

1885
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
So...

1886
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Sorry, you can't see the action show.

1887
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Are you ready?

1888
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Oh!

1889
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Oh, look at all that.

1890
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Reflash.

1891
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I didn't realize I was sticking your freaking ankle.

1892
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I'm getting

1893
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
a gorilla-fing mix now.

1894
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Always have been.

1895
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Do you listen to churches?

1896
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Because they're Scottish.

1897
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I saw them in person.

1898
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I was very, very young.

1899
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I got to see churches play.

1900
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I went off.

1901
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Oh!

1902
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Oh, yeah, I start that one hard.

1903
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I'm not even kidding, I actually can hurt.

1904
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Oh my god, have I been?

1905
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
The other thing I'll be bending

1906
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
is this later.

1907
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Sorry, that was really left.

1908
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Have a bit like a sexy, lingerie

1909
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
dress.

1910
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Not like a girly girl dress.

1911
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Well, we're discussing it at the end of this week

1912
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
what you guys want

1913
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
because I want to make sure you actually get what you...

1914
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Oh!

1915
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
That was a clear, a clear cut case.

1916
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
That was an easy one.

1917
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Okay, you.

1918
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Oh my god, I like...

1919
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
This is the one that came off, so I ended up using

1920
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
like a ton of wood to keep it on.

1921
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Your ability to not...

1922
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
You want a girly girl dress?

1923
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
No, we'll be painting.

1924
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
No, we'll be painting.

1925
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Gentile.

1926
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Did you notice it?

1927
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Kind and French.

1928
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Oh wait, gentile.

1929
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
We're thinking...

1930
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Gentile in English.

1931
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Kind?

1932
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I can't remember.

1933
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Snippa.

1934
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1935
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Oh, it kind of hurts.

1936
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Ow.

1937
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Oh my god, please. Oh, thank god.

1938
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I was like, please don't make me a girl forever.

1939
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Look, I've got games to play.

1940
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
So I was...

1941
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I've got vermin tide with the boys next week

1942
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
and by the boys.

1943
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yes, we're playing vermin tide again.

1944
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
So I just gave them a lesson today, look.

1945
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Thank you, Algea, for the extended membership.

1946
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I...

1947
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I hear French.

1948
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Thank you.

1949
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
C'est va, j'ai un peu de l'extrône.

1950
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Oh, you're best at that.

1951
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Fucking look at that amount of like nail glue

1952
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
that's left over.

1953
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I've got one more to go.

1954
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I've got to do some work.

1955
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Have fun at work.

1956
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That's right, I said have fun at work.

1957
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Ow, ow, ow.

1958
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Ow, ow.

1959
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Ow, ow, ow.

1960
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Ow, ow.

1961
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
It is over with.

1962
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I'm a tomboy once more.

1963
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Me and the boys.

1964
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Me and the boys.

1965
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
This is much more like me.

1966
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
What is all that going on?

1967
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
No.

1968
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
This is me.

1969
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Stroney and Emmy collab went very soon to him

1970
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
and me and Emmy actually have a confirmed collab

1971
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
together with two other people

1972
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
that you may be familiar with

1973
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
or may know, I don't know.

1974
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Eh, base.

1975
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I managed to convince Emmy to play a game.

1976
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1977
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I'm forcing she to be able to play Halo with me.

1978
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Mm.

1979
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Oh my god.

1980
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Reflins.

1981
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Why is it so sticky? Reflin?

1982
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
You didn't warn me before putting your ink on

1983
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
as glue. It was going to be this sticky.

1984
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
This is outrageous amounts of glue.

1985
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Reflin.

1986
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It's...

1987
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
How do you even produce that?

1988
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
How do you even produce that?

1989
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's so sticky.

1990
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I don't even know how you're doing that.

1991
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I can't get it off.

1992
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I just have your ink just sitting on my nail.

1993
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
It literally looks like

1994
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I've been picking my nails.

1995
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
You're welcome.

1996
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Coagulation.

1997
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Don't ink shame us.

1998
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I'll ink shame you.

1999
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
As much as I please.

2000
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Just kidding.

2001
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I love your ink.

2002
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Please ink more.

2003
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Dr. Funding case, you rip a nail.

2004
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
No, thank you lord.

2005
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Just thumbs up my nails for this thing.

2006
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
We're going to see.

2007
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
So is that alcohol wipe?

2008
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Wipe.

2009
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Sorry, don't wipe.

2010
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Is that alcohol wipe?

2011
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
As soon as this is what's going to remove

2012
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
the alcohol on top of my fingers.

2013
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Right?

2014
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Copium.

2015
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So strong smelling.

2016
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
It really is chloroform.

2017
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
This goes to the ink jar.

2018
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Thank you lord.

2019
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Just thumbs up.

2020
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I want to tell you something.

2021
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I'm half desolated.

2022
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Did I take...

2023
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
What? Did I take too much...

2024
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Sink?

2025
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Oh, zinc.

2026
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Have you...

2027
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Are any of you unironically taken zinc?

2028
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
You don't need to...

2029
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
You don't need to take zinc from me.

2030
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I assure you.

2031
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Oh my god, it's like two squares.

2032
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Sorry, that's so cute.

2033
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
It's like two little squares together.

2034
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I'm easily unironically.

2035
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Who me? Never.

2036
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Nah, I've got more zinc than a battery.

2037
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
That is amazing.

2038
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Zinc will kill you.

2039
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
It's a multivitamin.

2040
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Vitamins, eh?

2041
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Cool gum.

2042
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
But I'm going to get me...

2043
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I'm not an iron sheet.

2044
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Just watch in my multivitamin.

2045
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
No, I don't know how many guys I've taken.

2046
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Oh, Flintstone gummies.

2047
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Is that what you guys are taking?

2048
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I didn't realize how popular Flintstone gummies were.

2049
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
What does zinc help with?

2050
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Producing more ink, apparently.

2051
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Whether or not it's true.

2052
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
It's a whole different...

2053
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Well, I mean...

2054
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Oh, I just dropped it, but...

2055
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I mean...

2056
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Uh...

2057
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
No? Question mark?

2058
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
That did not do what I thought it was going to do?

2059
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Like...

2060
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I don't know if you can hear

2061
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
the amount of glue that's still on.

2062
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
That's glue.

2063
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
That's not like... You know how when

2064
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
a nail is smooth, it's like...

2065
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
It may not...

2066
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Only ink can remove it.

2067
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Oh, that looks...

2068
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Yeah, I'm kind of looking at that one.

2069
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Right, is everyone satisfied?

2070
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Or do you need... Do you want anything else?

2071
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
A paper? Oh!

2072
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Maybe that's why they give you this.

2073
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I'm just not going to have a nail by the time

2074
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I'm done with this, I'm going to be honest.

2075
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
A cuddle, you want me to cuddle?

2076
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Send them down to a noob.

2077
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm just getting full already.

2078
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
That's just a nail file.

2079
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I mean, a sandpaper, just with less grit.

2080
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
You know, taking them out of grit.

2081
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
You want some cuddles? I can give you some cuddles.

2082
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Baby, go near my little...

2083
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Oh, you get...

2084
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Uh...

2085
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I'm going to go get something, okay?

2086
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
And it's a...

2087
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I may or may not have almost went

2088
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
to the hospital yesterday, and I'm going to show you why.

2089
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
I completely forgot

2090
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
because I took my medicine.

2091
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Give me one minute.

2092
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I almost went to the hospital yesterday.

2093
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
You ready, baby?

2094
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Did Gimli come in while I was away?

2095
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I didn't close the door.

2096
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
So...

2097
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Sigh...

2098
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I almost went

2099
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
to the hospital yesterday.

2100
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Do you want to know why

2101
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I almost went to the hospital yesterday?

2102
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Because I

2103
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
went to the hospital yesterday

2104
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
because I was so sick

2105
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
and I was so sick.

2106
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I was so sick.

2107
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I almost went to the hospital yesterday

2108
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
because I was fighting a shower.

2109
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Now, for those of you

2110
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
who are uninitiated

2111
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
on what this piercing is,

2112
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
this piercing

2113
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
belongs on my chest.

2114
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I now no longer

2115
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
have two chest piercings.

2116
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I entered the shower

2117
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
and my piercing

2118
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
came out.

2119
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
However,

2120
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I have good news.

2121
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
It turns out

2122
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
that the chest is so

2123
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
willing to heal itself

2124
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
that

2125
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
it closed very quickly

2126
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
the location that was split.

2127
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
And it is now

2128
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
back to being a part of me when originally

2129
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
it wasn't.

2130
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
So I almost went to the hospital

2131
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
but I didn't

2132
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
because it closed up.

2133
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I am okay.

2134
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I am on pain medication

2135
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
but unfortunately

2136
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
this angel has lost

2137
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
one wing. I still have one wing left

2138
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
but

2139
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I thought maybe it's a funny ha ha

2140
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
the top

2141
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
donator can have my wing

2142
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
if you want it.

2143
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
So, yeah,

2144
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I'm not going to lost too much

2145
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
because I don't want to give away but

2146
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
let me just get so

2147
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
this one should actually be here right now.

2148
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
This one is not here.

2149
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
It's in my hand.

2150
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
It should be right here

2151
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
but it's not. So I have one

2152
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
wing on. This angel has one wing.

2153
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
So that's

2154
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
the story about how I almost went to the hospital

2155
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and it wasn't about my heart.

2156
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
A Christmas miracle.

2157
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
So you split your neck I did

2158
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
on a shower nonetheless.

2159
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Oh sorry, did you see my butt?

2160
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
That's impossible.

2161
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I'm now a one winged angel

2162
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
and no, I'm not getting it redone

2163
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
before anyone's like, I need a repairs.

2164
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
No, I'm not getting a repairs. You're done for.

2165
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
New wing fund, it must feel weird.

2166
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
No, I'm literally not. I'm too scared.

2167
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Nietzsche junkie bird.

2168
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Thank you, I'm actually too scared.

2169
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Did you try to do a handstand in the shower?

2170
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I tried.

2171
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
So the shower in my rental

2172
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
it's not like it opens

2173
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
180 degrees

2174
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
it can only open 90 degrees

2175
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
but because the door

2176
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
was open into the shower

2177
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
like into the shower room

2178
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
it was 45 degrees

2179
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
and I was like, I'm going to be

2180
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
so skinny Malinky

2181
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
and put myself in the shower

2182
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
at a 45 degree like opening

2183
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
and I caught my

2184
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
and it came right out.

2185
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
This is why I need

2186
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I need cuddles, okay?

2187
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And

2188
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I am on painkillers, please don't worry.

2189
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I did a ton of research

2190
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and basically what happened is

2191
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
a lot of people said it actually closes

2192
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
if you hold it and I did the pressure thing

2193
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
and I'm like, okay.

2194
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
You want to kiss it better?

2195
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Okay, kiss it better.

2196
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Excuse me, where my kiss is?

2197
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Please kiss it better.

2198
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I said kiss it better, right now.

2199
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I'm enjoying better

2200
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
right now.

2201
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Kiss it.

2202
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Okay, thank you

2203
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
and I keep getting

2204
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
to you.

2205
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
My little baby

2206
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
and we know it's a refill because you have

2207
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
your little thing here.

2208
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Oh my baby.

2209
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
To you.

2210
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
My little baby.

2211
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Did you know that saliva is

2212
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
a healing agent? Is it actually?

2213
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
After the kiss of someone like

2214
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
kisses in Scottish?

2215
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Aggressively

2216
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
kisses in.

2217
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Okay.

2218
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Give us the kids back.

2219
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Modes have too much bacteria to risk it.

2220
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Yeah, I had that in

2221
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Modes like a whole ton of

2222
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
things.

2223
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Great.

2224
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I know that always come quiet.

2225
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I'm going to see

2226
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
if she be on and I can redirect

2227
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
into her and I'll go

2228
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
risk. Actually, I should be watching

2229
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Shrek right now in a membership stream.

2230
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I'm so sorry, I got distracted.

2231
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Hold on.

2232
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute.

2233
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Is she being up?

2234
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Raid.

2235
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Yeah, I'm reading Sheepsters.

2236
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
If the raid function wants to work

2237
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
because it literally never wants to work.

2238
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Customization redirect.

2239
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Oh, she's doing ASMR as well.

2240
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Well, she'll actually be doing

2241
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
real ASMR unlike me.

2242
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Okay, so these changes were saved.

2243
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
So we're going to redirect into Shebe

2244
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
and then for the membership briefings

2245
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
we are going to watch Shrek and if

2246
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
you just give me like five minutes to clean up.

2247
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Oh, no.

2248
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I'm such a liar.

2249
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Oh, no.

2250
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I've completely forgotten.

2251
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Hold on.

2252
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I've completely forgot to show you this

2253
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
nature thing. Hold on.

2254
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I'm so sorry.

2255
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I'm such a fake streamer.

2256
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Oh my God, give me one second.

2257
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I'm going to show you something real really quickly.

2258
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
So easier. Thanks for the stream.

2259
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
ASMR is great in your voice. Oh, thank you.

2260
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Hold on.

2261
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Hold on. I've got another thing to show you.

2262
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Oh, God, that's so lovely.

2263
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Can anyone guess what I'm going to show you?

2264
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Can anyone guess what I'm going to show you?

2265
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I don't know if you're going to be able to guess that.

2266
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Pokemon kind.

2267
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Nail.

2268
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Full on the other shop. Nice try.

2269
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
A Lego set? No, that didn't arrive yet.

2270
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I did have a Lego set on the leasing.

2271
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Judging by the same drug?

2272
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
No, gamer's thoughts?

2273
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
No, my PR package did arrive though.

2274
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I need to ask for permission.

2275
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Oh, you got it.

2276
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Veil or key chain.

2277
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
No, my proper color isn't here.

2278
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Ah, I took my nails off.

2279
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
This would have been so much better if I could...

2280
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Here's Marys V.

2281
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Shoulda picked Marys V.

2282
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
And then I've got Sheeby.

2283
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
They're so cute.

2284
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Oh, my God.

2285
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I'm going to do an ASMR video.

2286
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Like, tapping.

2287
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Just pure tapping on these.

2288
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
That'll be the video. I could do nothing.

2289
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I'm going to take nails back on.

2290
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
And then I've got

2291
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
myself.

2292
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And Azura.

2293
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Oh, my good son.

2294
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Shoulda picked me.

2295
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Sorry, I'm biased for moments.

2296
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I'm biased for me.

2297
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Oh, my God. I look so cute.

2298
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
What the fuck?

2299
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Matt, Sheeby's are so cute.

2300
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Because my design is so, like, cheap-a-fall.

2301
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Cheap-a-fall. Cheap-a-fiable.

2302
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
And, of course, I've got Azura.

2303
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
You're Mum-meh.

2304
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
So you've got Mummy and Mum-meh.

2305
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
This is Mum-meh.

2306
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
If you want to focus a little bit.

2307
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Just a little bit.

2308
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Now, last but not least, we've got the twins.

2309
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And before you ask, wait, why are they called twins?

2310
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
In development,

2311
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I refer to

2312
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
them as the twins.

2313
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Because they were both a lollipop.

2314
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
So these are my twins.

2315
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
My babies.

2316
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Oh, the embers.

2317
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Oh, the ace.

2318
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
But yeah, these are on UwU Market.

2319
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
If you want just a little casual keychain.

2320
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
To show, to silently show your support.

2321
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Because, literally, I don't think anyone's going to look at you funny

2322
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
for having an anime girl.

2323
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Let's be honest, anime is the most

2324
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
fucking popular medium right now.

2325
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
But I am going to record

2326
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
an ace and more video.

2327
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I'm going to put the fake nails back on.

2328
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Oh, yeah, it is mine.

2329
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Oh, yeah, it is mine.

2330
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
You know?

2331
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I'll take your entire sotsies.

2332
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
You can...

2333
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I'm very happy to say

2334
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
that if you buy anything off of UwU Market,

2335
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
all the profits go to the girls.

2336
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Veal or I do not take a cut.

2337
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
So, if you buy stuff for AC,

2338
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
you're supporting AC, you know what I mean?

2339
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
You buy stuff from Emmy,

2340
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
you're supporting Emmy.

2341
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
And it's the same for all the girls, we all have the same deal.

2342
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I made sure of it.

2343
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I was not getting...

2344
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
What is it, the height of that nail?

2345
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I'm just going to pump it.

2346
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Yeah, I was...

2347
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
No, I haven't. No one's getting a scum almost.

2348
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
A little mercy.

2349
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
We'll see.

2350
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Yeah, if you want to support any of the girls, you can.

2351
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
But if you want a keychain,

2352
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
these are probably the most silent support you can do.

2353
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Just because it's really...

2354
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
It does not get in the way.

2355
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
If this is on a keychain with tons of other stuff,

2356
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Gimli...

2357
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Gimli, do you want to shovel the girls with me?

2358
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Be honest.

2359
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
What about the designer?

2360
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
The designer was from Ubu Market.

2361
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
He did it in house.

2362
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I got the concept art means.

2363
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
But the designer gets paid a fee

2364
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
by Ubu Market for the publishing rates.

2365
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
And then I want to see Gimli.

2366
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
You want to see her again?

2367
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Oops, sorry, just bumped the camera.

2368
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
You want to say goodbye to the refunds?

2369
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
No, as soon as I open the door,

2370
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
she walks away. She's actually such a cheeky.

2371
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
In you go.

2372
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
In you go.

2373
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Are you going to watch Rick with me in the refunds?

2374
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Come here.

2375
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Come here, baby girl.

2376
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
There you go.

2377
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
She does not.

2378
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Oh my god, you're freezing.

2379
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Don't you put the heat in on?

2380
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Sorry, I'm going to go put the heat in on for her.

2381
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Right, I'm going to redirect into Sheevee.

2382
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Thank you so much for the ASMR stream.

2383
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
That's never an ASMR stream, let's be honest with me.

2384
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I will see you goofy gubbers later.

2385
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Thank you Ting, Spiny.

2386
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Well mate, it just occurred to me that Asi could actually be in his twin.

2387
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Maybe she was on a flight when her twin wasn't

2388
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
and they separated her.

2389
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Oh no.

2390
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Is that Vigo? Did you just come in as well?

2391
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Okay, they're both in the room.

2392
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Right, you guys win.

2393
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
You guys win, you're finally allowed in on stream.

2394
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
But thank you so, so much.

2395
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
My hair.

2396
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Please enjoy Sheevee to your heart's content.

2397
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I apologize that whenever I do ASMR,

2398
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I don't actually do ASMR.

2399
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I know what I saw, please.

2400
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
For those of you who are a member,

2401
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
we are going to watch Reckon in about 10 minutes.

2402
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
You just need to give me a hot second

2403
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
and then I will be able to

2404
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
rate Vigo.

2405
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I get it.

2406
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Okay, love you. Talk to you later, Reefland.

2407
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

2408
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Bye.

2409
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Please redirect.
