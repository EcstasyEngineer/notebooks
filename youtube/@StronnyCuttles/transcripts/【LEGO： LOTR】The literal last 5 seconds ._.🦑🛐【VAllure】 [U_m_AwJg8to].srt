1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You hear me?

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You hear me?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You can hear me?

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh my god, we're reading an astronomy course, that's my favorite.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ready?

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Can you hear me?

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Testing?

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
One, two, three.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One, two, three.

14
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You guys are saying where's mommy but on my end it says I'm streaming.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Where's this new streamer?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Reefling rain.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Get to go?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You hear me?

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, let's go.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Literally I did not do a thing.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hi, thank you for the read.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Strongly cuttles, thank you so much.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I hope you had a good stream.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What did you get up to?

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, you're playing LEGO Lord of the Rings.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am Strongly Cuttles from Vealor, Gen 1.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We do alternative things on the base of our spaces.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Other than that we are pretty much regular, schmagular feature groups that just do their

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
thing and have a good time.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you so much for the redirect that was very kind of you.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, I see it's a reefling is your fan name.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's a very cute name.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I wonder where you got it from?

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This will be the shortest stream.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sure.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Literally I think I'll read like a few marshmallows and I'll pass them out and then I'll fix the

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
thumbnail when I can.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Give me all your money.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh my god, we're destroying Hobbits and no, the books are real.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Literally 71% right now.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's really destroying all of us though.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That shit was blending in.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't see none.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I can get an animal to raise, I don't have to actually.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's what I think about your corn patch.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You Skellywags.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Should I collab with Strongly?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you like her?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know much about her.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll need to do my research in case her agency is after her history.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She's destroying everything I possibly can.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Fair warning, she's got all...

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know what I've heard about them Scottish chicks, you know.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The culture clash is out the wazoo.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Not very good, not very good at all.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She's a bit unhinged but she's a nice girl.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I mean, if she means well, that's the main thing.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Even if things don't always work out as long as you mean well at the end of the day, then, you know.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You remind me a little bit of her.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Would we get along?

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you think we can get along.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not a shy VTuber.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I message people and say, hey, want to collab?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, we are 83%.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Not the worst.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, she loves Lord of the Rings.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, okay, I like anyone who's a friend of Lord of the Rings, a friend of mine.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Like, after destroying their house, they're just chilling out in the open.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They're like, where did all of our housing go?

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I could have sworn I paid a mortgage for something.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
83%.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
84%.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She also makes a lot of bread each stream.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, she might be brewing it internally.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can tell you that much, but pass on it, fuck no.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That shit doesn't come out of that whenever I see it.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Where's house?

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Literally, where's house gone?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
84%.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I mean, I like all these wee things and such.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That is so unfortunate, but I can't even think at one point on stream

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
where I wasn't super productive in terms of like,

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
like I was mucking about, like, you know, something.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Like, that's nonstop.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know how on air.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How am I supposed to get up here?

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, I can get up here though.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't realize I had access to this.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, there's already a rope.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sorry.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm starting to forget you and mommy look quite similar, huh?

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't remember this part in talking.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't remember either.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm gonna rave before I...

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm very curious to see if this is the last part

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and how long the stream actually went on for it

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because I have a feeling it's gonna be a millisecond.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It says I've streamed for five minutes

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and one minute was me being like, can you hear me? Hello?

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Eighty-six percent.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think this is a replica of Riffin' though.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you're looking for shorter games in the future,

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
there's a remake of the robot.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What? I don't know that.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Beat the crap out of these.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Everything.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Give me your money. Eighty-seven percent.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Girl, I'm sweet. I'm extorting.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, why would you jump up?

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm extorting everything for every last painting.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't even reach that. I'm too small.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
These are unbreakable. Unbreakable?

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Unbreakable?

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Unbreakable trees?

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is all unbreakable now.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sunflower?

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Up next, Subscriber to the World in Konghua.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hit Subscribers against each other.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, I'm just kidding.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What is this?

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Who's it that?

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Sure. I'm glad that helps.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is Lorian, clearly, because of the trees.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We're destroying all of Middle-earth.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Since they couldn't do it, they were unsuccessful.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We're letting them do it in the Lego world.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, wow. A whole 1,000 studs for me?

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
These levels just lower to the range of sorrow and prep.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't even... Is this a joke?

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm being trolled.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What is this, dude?

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Huh?

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I didn't expect... I have to admit I didn't expect that.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
8.9%? Can I break this down?

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so...

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
8%.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I literally couldn't have it.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I need the sheep, because they're so fast.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And dealing with these little things as well.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll take them back to that other location.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But, literally, the sheep can skirt the edge so well.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And they can knock little things that I wouldn't necessarily...

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Clickbait? Did you fall for it?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The literal last 5 seconds of the darn stream.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You've got pranks!

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, I got you so good.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You feel so pranked right now.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I bet you feel like the egg is on your face.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, all that egg on your face?

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's good for me, you're welcome.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's...

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Break all this.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Seriously, I don't know what developer thought of this level.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They were evil. Pure evil.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
90%. Thank you.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We're getting there, we're getting there, we're getting there, we're getting there.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Skirting the edge.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There's a lot of plants.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The plants all add up.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is Sauron doing to that gun?

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He's just in...

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's destroy the plants and only give them money.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
People don't give money.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No, so stop trying to destroy them.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Pure people are just trying to live after pillage their land.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Take that, that's what I think about your beer.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The one thing here.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh my god, I'm such a failure.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ding ding!

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm here to pillage.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I didn't do it, I didn't actually...

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, okay, okay.

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We're still missing 96,000.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
96,000.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I need to go back in that cavern, I think.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Sauron is...

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We got a bridge.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Going back in this cavern because...

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I mean, shit, am I really getting that desperate?

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I need to pick up the wee one.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You have to literally get every stud?

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I hope that, is that real?

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Is that actually real?

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm not scrimping over silver studs.

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No way that's...

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There has to be room for mobility.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There's no room.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I refuse to believe that the game literally is like I am.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
As if they, I can't jump over that.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Please, work with me here.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm just sitting in the back, going back and forth, back and forth.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Go to the ledge if you want to.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The hardest challenge is the lift for the last...

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This doesn't move, you don't do anything?

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't you do?

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't prank me now.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
92%, don't prank me now.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm getting there.

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm getting every last problem in this main, do you understand?

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're in the main chat.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Enough of that.

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't beat this up.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I can't do that.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't claim up there because I'm heavy.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't want this to be a troll or something.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm also going to destroy this now because I want the head put in remove.

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
9.2.

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is indestructible or doesn't need to push it or something.

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is pushable.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's on tracks.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Push it.

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not sure why.

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And now I can destroy it.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Mm-hmm.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I destroy you now?

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I serve like glitches out.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why?

223
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I feel like I should have got the other one.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And before bug.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't want to hear it.

226
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Ow.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't want to hear such slander.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We're 9.3.

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
9.3.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There's something behind the fire over here that never touched me.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Ow.

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Beat it up.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Beat it up.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
9.3.

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
3.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
93.

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to equip the bombs because the bombs will auto-target.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Sorry, fireworks.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They should auto-target shape.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What shape?

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Just anything that might be like that.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
For example.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is this really...

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Do I really not do anything at all?

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It just moves about.

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't seem to destroy that.

249
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm just...

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But...

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think I did it.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't think the left one went in.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't think so either.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I think it glitched out for me unfortunately.

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't even correct it.

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So I'm really hoping this is not the final factor.

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And that the game developers were wise enough to not make a mode.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That was so dependent on the destruction of one building alone.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You know?

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Maybe I can reach back here.

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The back of the roof.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I mean, I'll take a blue stud for my efforts.

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll do, as I said, a mosh.

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sheep can get me around a lot faster.

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So...

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What's the dealy over here?

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay.

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay.

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm on my fireworks.

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Maybe.

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Uh...

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Did I drop much from the fireworks?

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Abracadabra.

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know.

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Name point five one...

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Name five point one percent.

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Sorry, I keep saying it wrong for them.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm a bit...

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I swear.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Alright, Loth Lorian.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm gonna need you to Loth offer me some money.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How about that?

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay, that's more like it.

287
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay, that makes a bit more sense.

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nope.

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay, so we can climb up the tree.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Whack what we can.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay.

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay.

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay.

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There we go.

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Lord of the Rings, complete the bonus level.

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Unlock all characters.

297
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
There and back again.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Get a hundred percent.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We did it.

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We did it.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And we did it.

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, thanks for the million studs,

303
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
as if my, like, a billion, like, things don't counter that.

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But we did it.

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hundred percent.

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Lord of the Rings.

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Only took me three streams.

308
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm kicking my butt so badly right now

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that I didn't do at least a few things

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
before I finished this stream.

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I didn't think.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Lutz newborn.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I knew there was something to do with Lutz.

314
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
A little sheet bag.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We did it.

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's done.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Play the field.

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Play that faded field.

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hold on, where is it?

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, no way.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Thank you so much for the gifts and memberships.

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I thought, okay, thank you.

323
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Holy crap.

324
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

325
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank you so much.

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We did it.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hundred percent.

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Complete though.

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Squishy.

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Squishy.

331
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you for the extended membership as well.

332
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Congrats, Johnny.

333
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you.

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's go, Lutz.

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
A short day.

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
A red day.

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Bill shall be shaken.

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Bill shall be flitters.

339
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Bye now.

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Bye, far away.

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Shroom.

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Shroom.

343
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Shroom.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Baa.

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Shroom.

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Shroom.

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Shroom.

348
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Shroom.

349
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Shroom.

350
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Shroom.

351
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shroom.

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Baa.

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you squidding me right now?

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What?

355
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,120
Nameless. Thank you for the 10 gifted memberships. It says anonymous. It says

356
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,280
nameless on the other screen. Thank you for the 10 gifted memberships as well.

357
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,080
Thank you. I didn't know where that hate for Legal Lord of the Rings got aim.

358
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,480
Thank you. So very kind. Thank you again. I honestly thought you were trawlin. I'm

359
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,600
not gonna lie. Not to do you. Not Doro, but yeah.

360
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,600
Gamer sub's yum. Use 10% Shawnee for 10% off. Shit. I don't know what I'm talking about, I believe.

361
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Thank y'all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank y'all.

362
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Smuggot? Did you just change your name in real-time? Did that work?

363
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
It says smuggot.

364
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Yo, Samwise is hitting it. Look at him going with that pan.

365
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

366
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
God damn.

367
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Release, leather.

368
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Quickest Gamer sub partnership to my face.

369
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Wasn't there an ending cutscene? Not that I know of.

370
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Oh, In the Shire?

371
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Buster the Roe, hear him, hear him.

372
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh my god, Iron Reapers as well. Thank you for the 50 gifted membership.

373
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Guys, what the fuck?

374
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,600
There's a final cutscene. Where did I get it? Thank you, Iron Reapers.

375
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Thank you, Smuggot is what it says. I don't know.

376
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Smuggot.

377
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Do more. Thank you, Will.

378
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
And Pakufo again. Holy crap.

379
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Thank you so much for all the kindness. Holy crap.

380
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Please do thank if you catch us up.

381
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Don't worry if you don't know us right away though.

382
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Talk to Bilbo in the final cutscene.

383
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Okay.

384
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Oh my god. Will I do the same tenors?

385
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Well, thank you everyone so much.

386
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
What the fuck? There's not gonna be one green aim in the house.

387
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Oh my gosh. Are we ready for the cutscene?

388
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Holy gifted, literally. Thank you for what you've been saying.

389
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Thank you, Iron Reapers. Thank you, Smuggot.

390
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
And thank you, Pakufo.

391
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah, meep. So many gifted. So many people dodging it as well.

392
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I have to admit it's a little bit funny.

393
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Okay, ready for the last cutscene?

394
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Are you ready?

395
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I broke.

396
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
My game crashed.

397
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Okay, hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. My game crashed.

398
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Hold on. Let's try that again. Hold on.

399
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I broke my freaking...

400
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Hold on. Hold on. What a cutscene.

401
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
No, no, it's fine. It's fine. Hold on. Let me just...

402
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Oh, I didn't even realise I was cut off randomly.

403
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Why am I cut off? Why am I cut off?

404
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I didn't change anything about me.

405
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Why am I floating?

406
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Sorry, man. Let's try that again. Hold on. Hold on.

407
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Hold on. Let me do the cutscene.

408
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Let me do the cutscene.

409
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Okay, it's opening up. I'm pausing. Probably I'm starting about.

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Hold on. Let's try again, okay?

411
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I'm in the cutscene.

412
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
I swear if that registered that I can't rewatch the cutscene, I'm gonna cry.

413
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Okay, let's try that again.

414
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Load game. 100%.

415
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Let's go to Hobbiton.

416
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Really? Yeah, you really enjoyed that.

417
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Let's hope this cutscene doesn't break my game.

418
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
And it's still accessible.

419
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Okay.

420
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Let's make our way to Hobbiton.

421
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Okay, let's try that again, shall we?

422
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Okay, captain's lost the noodles. Thank you for becoming a member.

423
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Right, cutscene.

424
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
No memory leakage.

425
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I will enjoy it for what it's worth, okay?

426
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Shit!

427
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
It's corrupt.

428
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
My game files corrupt. I can't play the scene.

429
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I broke my thing again.

430
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,600
My files corrupt after 100%.

431
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Do you want a third time? Do we try a third time?

432
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
It's corrupt. I don't know.

433
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't know.

434
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Time to open a video.

435
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Oh my god.

436
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I think I'm gonna have to...

437
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Lego, Lord of the Rings, ending 100% cutscene.

438
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
And then I'll share screen.

439
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Okay, this is 100% my gameplay.

440
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
What you're about to see, okay?

441
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
This is 100% my gameplay.

442
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
100%, no doubt this is my gameplay.

443
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
This is my gameplay.

444
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
This is...

445
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Hold on.

446
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
You went a bit fast for me and we'll be honest.

447
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
We can't expect me to do that so quickly.

448
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Fucking hell.

449
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
How about you just relax for one day?

450
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Just bring yourself down a little bit.

451
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Hold on.

452
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
This is still my gameplay.

453
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
What do you mean you can see the pause?

454
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
What are you talking about?

455
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Fucking hell. How many things have I got instant?

456
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
See? It's 100% my gameplay.

457
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Are we ready to play it?

458
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
You ready?

459
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
What do you mean YouTube isn't a full...

460
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
No, YouTube isn't full screen. What are you talking about?

461
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
10 billion stu...

462
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Yeah.

463
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
The game crashed and it gave me some of the studs that I owed me.

464
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Okay, 100% my gameplay.

465
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Okay, let's see what this is all about.

466
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Button number three.

467
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Oh, it crashed. No.

468
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
The age of elves is over.

469
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
The age of now.

470
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
I think I'm...

471
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
one ready for another break.

472
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I think so, yeah.

473
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,640
I ain't crying over legal blocks today.

474
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I'll cry in the movie though.

475
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
No.

476
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Great note.

477
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Aww, they brought the gang in.

478
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Borrow me, I've just been chilling as I go.

479
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Thank you for coming to member in the Directed Tour.

480
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
They did it!

481
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
They did it!

482
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Yatta!

483
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Oh my god, we did it.

484
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,840
I don't know why my file's corrupted and couldn't play that.

485
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
As if my PC isn't an absolute beast.

486
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Please relax, PC.

487
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Please relax.

488
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
But we're here, we did it!

489
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
We did it!

490
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Do you want Marshmallow or are we all going to sleep?

491
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Because we're exhausted.

492
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Well, speaking of really hard Dark Souls games,

493
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
I guess I'm redirecting into it.

494
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
You didn't hear that.

495
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,840
You didn't hear who I'm redirecting into.

496
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,840
If you recognised who that was via a squeal.

497
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
One, you're cooked.

498
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Two, that's amazing.

499
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
Please, you need to get a shower at to do it.

500
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm sweating and disgusting.

501
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I can feel my...

502
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I can feel everything.

503
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Uh...

504
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Uh, right.

505
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Oh, thank you, Odin.

506
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Yeah, could you?

507
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
We're becoming a member as well.

508
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Holy shit, that was insane.

509
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Thank you again for all the gifted memberships.

510
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
I didn't expect any of that.

511
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Nor did you have to do that, but that was incredibly kind of you.

512
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
That was insanity, incarnate.

513
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
That was crazy.

514
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
She's redirecting into Mercium.

515
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Wait, is it Mercium?

516
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Mercie's not online right now.

517
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
She's not live, you stinker.

518
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
She's not like...

519
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Tron, which kind of is.

520
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Okay, thank you.

521
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Shout out to the save file for being corrupted.

522
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Um...

523
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Thank you so, so much everyone

524
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
for just being so lovely.

525
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
I'm gonna be redirecting to someone.

526
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I'll stay for a moment and then I'm out.

527
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
I need to go lie down and get a shower

528
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
and then lie down because I fucking stink.

529
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Literally, um, thank you.

530
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
There's not even a point of being like, haha, pheromone...

531
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
No, I literally weak. I'm disgusting.

532
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm filthy. I need to scrub my skin.

533
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
The grease on me is enough to open up

534
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
a fish and chip shop on my head alone.

535
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
As much as I like to meme about

536
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,840
I need a shower, okay?

537
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
So don't encourage the pheromone max on the other point.

538
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Thank you so, so much for the love and the support

539
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
and just the craziness that is

540
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
that I get to share, like, these silly games

541
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
that I absolutely adore

542
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
