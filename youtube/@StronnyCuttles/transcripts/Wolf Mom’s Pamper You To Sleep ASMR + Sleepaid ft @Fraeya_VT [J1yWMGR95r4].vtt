00:00.000 --> 00:22.680
poor thing you need to rest it's okay we've got you now it's alright to let

00:22.680 --> 00:36.880
yourself relax we're here to reassure you all right don't mind our fluffy tails in fact you

00:36.880 --> 00:46.240
might find it quite pleasant to be wrapped up in between us don't you I can sense that your

00:46.240 --> 01:06.120
head is running 100 miles a minute but just take a moment to breathe one big inhale and one big exhale

01:06.120 --> 01:30.720
it's okay to take your time you know that right not everything has to be now now now no wonder you

01:30.720 --> 01:41.960
feel so stressed when you put such an immense amount of pressure on yourself who told you to do

01:41.960 --> 01:56.240
that do you listen to everyone it gives you terrible advice but I'm being serious when I say just

01:56.240 --> 02:07.560
take a moment to calm down you need some good sleep so I'll just have to make sure that I put

02:07.560 --> 02:19.960
you into the deepest slumber I can manage in that case you might even need me to tell she was

02:20.360 --> 02:31.800
wrong you know about what she said you put too much pressure on yourself you also put too much on

02:31.800 --> 02:41.520
your plate at the same time I know you like being the workhorse and you like getting to the other side

02:41.520 --> 02:49.840
but that's gonna have an effect on you if you sacrifice your sleep for it that's sacrificing

02:49.840 --> 03:03.920
your health do you understand me good then just take a moment and try your best to tune out what's

03:03.920 --> 03:14.760
going on around you it's just us three together in this moment we're guddled up we're looking after

03:14.760 --> 03:27.360
you hopefully on the other end of this conversation you can feel yourself slowly dressed in all of this

03:27.360 --> 03:39.680
sleep it's been a while since you've had a nice rest I can tell by your eyes it's the biggest

03:39.680 --> 03:52.080
giveaway you know they aren't cold the windows to your soul for nothing it's alright to close your

03:52.240 --> 04:04.240
eyes even if you don't think you'll fall asleep you can still listen to our words or at least the

04:04.240 --> 04:18.480
sounds that we make do you like being wrapped up in our tails it's very fluffy isn't it I love

04:18.960 --> 04:30.240
seeing people's reactions to just how incredibly soft they are why don't I try to reassure you a

04:30.240 --> 04:45.360
little while you focus on how soft how soothing our tails are it's okay to worry but don't worry

04:45.360 --> 04:58.080
you're so sick you are allowed to make mistakes you're only human after all so far you've made it

04:58.080 --> 05:10.240
through 100% of all of your bad days and that makes you so incredibly strong you've been able to push

05:10.320 --> 05:19.760
through everything even when life gets hard and you always come out on top on the other side don't

05:19.760 --> 05:33.600
you that makes you so very brave in my eyes sometimes you just need reassurance and that's okay

05:33.600 --> 05:48.320
I'm glad to be able to do that for you it's a pleasure in all honesty so thank you for listening

05:48.320 --> 05:56.480
to me the best way that we can support you right now is getting you to sleep I think

05:56.720 --> 06:07.280
it may seem like a small act but a well-rested mind can help navigate what the world has to offer

06:08.800 --> 06:19.840
sometimes it can be confusing why we have a negative experience you may think to yourself why me

06:20.560 --> 06:26.160
why now I present to you a question

06:29.040 --> 06:35.840
if everything in your life was good then would you really appreciate the good times

06:37.920 --> 06:45.680
I think sometimes with the bad it makes the good times even sweeter

06:46.560 --> 06:56.240
that's what I think anyway you might not agree or you might even be asleep by now

06:57.360 --> 07:07.040
just from our whispers alone wouldn't that be adorable humans really do work themselves silly

07:08.000 --> 07:14.240
then I should be extra mindful a pamper you in a pure bliss line

07:16.880 --> 07:22.640
good night dear human get as much rest as you need

07:22.640 --> 07:40.240
it's time to let it all go and enter the deep slumber
