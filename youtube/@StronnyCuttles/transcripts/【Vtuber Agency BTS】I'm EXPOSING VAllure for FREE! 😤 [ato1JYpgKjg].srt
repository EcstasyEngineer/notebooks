34
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,220
because some people might want to, you know, get a 2.0 model, some people want to maybe start up as a new

35
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,580
each of our like type thing with a new persona like I just didn't want anyone to be at that stage

36
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:12,060
so I'll just say publicly now no one has been contacted for a thingy and but yes okay so that was

37
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,780
kind of the application process the interview process I'm more than happy for the girls to talk

38
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:24,060
about the interview process with me uh basically if you're interested in Vealer I was the barrier

39
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,780
okay I was the one reviewing you and looking at your content if you applied and I was like you

40
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:38,460
and you know um it's a bit it's a bit awkward I'll say I'll say this part out loud it was a bit

41
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:48,620
morally hmm because I was judging v-tubers that had way more streaming experience than me to be like

42
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,700
oh you're worthy to come in or not and it's like hmm it wasn't a nice feeling kind of like being like

43
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:06,380
no but can't want me um right okay questions most basic why are you called vealer now check out the

44
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:14,780
v at the start virtual as most agencies start with a v for virtual okay and then the a okay now

45
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:24,220
now put v and a together okay what do you get you get voice acting voice acting okay and the girls

46
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:33,180
are doing amateur voice acting audios oh my god oh my god you did it you did it you put it together

47
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,020
also wait wait wait hold on hold on let's read it together let's read it together v okay and then

48
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:48,540
imagine if there was an imaginary dash allure allure as if the girls were alluring oh my oh my god

49
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,100
put it together we've done it lads we've cracked the fucking case okay that's why it can't feel

50
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:03,100
allure there's no other thing to it okay I thought it was pretty self like explanatory but it was

51
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:11,100
okay it wasn't I was like ve allure okay ve allure but we got so many different pronunciations

52
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I think if you have an american you're like ve allure and it's like I never really thought about

53
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,940
other accents saying it because obviously I want to accent but here you go um oh no questions why you call

54
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:32,300
vealer how hand on are you with the talents the talents can do whatever the fuck they want they

55
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,220
don't come to me for permission they don't have to come to me I want to do this I want to the only

56
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,140
thing they come to me with this they go I want a project I want this I want that I want this asset

57
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,620
then they come to me and I sugar mummy them and I'll be like there you go darlin all yours

58
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,180
hen poppy pop girls do what they want they do not need permission for in real life

59
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,340
hand cam streams for example none of that shit you guys have to understand we're all adults here

60
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,500
I am not going to treat anyone like they're a fucking child and they need permission from me to work

61
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,820
okay because as it stands they're you know doing work and streaming and all that you do not need permission

62
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:27,420
to okay so we don't do none of that shit around here one of the funniest comments I had seen so far

masse

130
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,660
Kanye

131
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,940
uh after this next batch because obviously i had to order it in a round because i didn't know them yet

132
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:08,460
there you go uh lore okay so this is this is super behind scene stuff so again squishy girl

133
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,500
conceptualize the lore so this is what an example of a lore story board looks like i'm giving

134
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,900
you the hints so this is a zura for example so as you can see uh the script right away the earth

135
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,940
was driven out baron and infancy then from dusk to darkness was the first family so this is called

136
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,820
concept art for the lore that was given to tea temachi temachi i would say timati but that's my accent

137
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:42,380
uh so that was this is these they're kind of it gives an idea of temachi watch oh temachi's in chat

138
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,180
temachi temachi temachi let's go squishy girls in chat but you know he's coming he's coming

139
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,300
okay but let's go temachi in chat so i'll give you a very quick example of what half wait hold on hold

140
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:03,100
on hold on let me cook let me cook let me cook let me cook so to give you a very quick example

141
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,740
i can only do it for my lore but here are the first three concept panels so gull did the concept

142
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:17,180
panels along with the script so concept one two and three and then temachi saw it and then come oh

143
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:25,420
it's a bit big hold on a minute hold on hold on uh uh uh it's very skull but let's be honest

144
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,740
this is never gonna be professional anyway ship one so temachi comes back with the sketch and you know

145
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:39,020
so literally we go from uh well the top corner one to to the sketch so she comes back with the

146
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,820
sketch absolutely beautiful garden beautiful beautiful and she and then with the approval of

147
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,860
the storyboard and the sketch then the full images come through and these come through all layered

148
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,660
these are all there the reason why we could get the little images to move about was because temachi

149
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,420
just worked so diligently so hard they were an absolute pleasure to work with i cannot recommend

150
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:10,940
temachi enough for like you know i gave her a lot of work like i could i could you know i was

151
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,660
insane work but as you can see from the finished result of the lores temachi

152
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,620
and beautiful that i look five star meal all the michelin stars or however they do it actually

153
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,900
i don't know how michelin stars work but yes so that's the behind the scenes of kind of the

154
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:38,940
development of the lore so again squishy gull not only did he do the storyboard he also

155
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,500
did the scripts in the background lores of the girls but i will come back to the development

156
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,100
of the girls very shortly um if you didn't know the merches are now out for the girls but again

157
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:58,220
in order to help artists it's so to make things such a smooth process behind the scenes um

158
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:08,220
having a concept artist to give the actual artists an idea of what you want helps so i hope i'm

159
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,380
not spoiling the merch that's coming out but this is a zura a little aces concept these are concepts

160
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,620
of the merchandise that you see on ubu market right now i'll talk about now um and then a little

161
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:29,580
mersey and shibi and but yeah again these are just concepts a beautiful behind the scenes stuff

162
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,500
it's really nice getting a thingy a little thingy so early development okay now now you're

163
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,100
going to start cringing at a few of the things that come up shortly but

164

171
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,620

172
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,700
so i'm gonna read it out to you don't worry if you can't read neither can i but i'll try my best to read it out

173
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:59,340
so when it comes to concepts okay as you'll notice these girls don't have names

174
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:06,940
because because the girls started without names that's how it is so for the lore for girl one

175
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:12,940
it was it was the best we got to hang out together we ordered food and watch anime all snuggled up

176
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,780
i couldn't have asked for anything more that night it was a shame that the truth never came out

177
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:23,100
that i could never tell my redacted that i love him before it was too late it's not fair now i'm some

178
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,100
what and now i'm somewhere i don't recognize and i'll never see him again you'll still watch over me

179
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,420
from where you are now though hmm wonder wonder who that is um but these are kind of description

180
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:43,260
lores very quick description okay uh girl lore two um when there's no one around to spoil what

181
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,580
am i gonna do with myself i've got no purpose if i don't have a a sweetheart to show my love okay

182
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:57,020
yeah that was that was a zura that was a zura that's where she started from see a zura was giving

183
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,580
more of a kind of servant goddess role but that definitely didn't really come into play um

184
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,260
mersey ostempai i know you're around here you're playing a game with me aren't you thinking you

185
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,820
can take me to an unfamiliar surrounding so i'd stop news flash baby i love you far too much to

186
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,460
ever give up the chase isn't it fun when your heart is practically beaten out of your chest

187
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:26,220
manik i'd do manic laughter but mersey absolutely fucking uh she mugs me with her laugh oh wait

188
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,220
you're not senpai but you could be from the one so you know if you don't know mersey kind of

189
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,860
you know you know how it goes with them four four

190
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:47,580
four okay four i have you're gonna find out why four is so confusing four is icy

191
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,700
i quit whoever made this game who even made this game and i read that wrong

192
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,540
whoever even made this game in the first place what's the point in putting achievements in a game

193
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,740
if only 0.2 percent of the player base can even achieve it screw this i'm going on a really

194
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,300
a website okay now what's the category tonight oh let's do a random roulette our discord okay

195
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,460
as you can see aces come a very long way okay that's not aces lore at all that's not a concept

196
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:23,660
we're not even there okay lore five i cannot for the life of me understand how guys work how

197
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:31,180
do their brains even function if only there is some sort of way i could get them to be truthful

198
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:40,300
with me um and yeah so i always started with a hypno theme obviously i got to pick what the

199
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,260
fuck i want to be because i was there from the start i was always gonna have hypno uh i just

200
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,780
didn't know what angle we were going for and then uh i got conceptualized and wanting to kill all

201
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,980
of humanity so yeah i didn't do that part by the way before you're like oh my god you're killing

202
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:07,820
now uh no sorry i'm rubbing my face heat and then six um six uh it should be yeah um i've had it

203
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,740
bunny boys are pathetic they can never keep up with me and i don't know why i bother wasting my

204
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,460
time i just need something different human males surely can keep up with this stamina of

205
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,020
my needs type thing okay so that's how the girls started okay they all started deeply departed

206
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,820
so that's it all right okay this is a really fun this is i hated naming everyone i hated it i

207
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:35,740
hated it the the reason why you don't see emmy bezu right now is because emmy bezu was named

208
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:44,300
correctly azura you were a nightmare to name oh my god i went through so many names i literally

209
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:51,660
came up with stacey milkerton azura you were so hard to name for no reason you can literally

210
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:57,660
see how desperate i was getting through your name i was like stacey milkerton miss milkerton

211
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:03,820
milfoo pillow show show means darling in french yeah right she's a goat god

212
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:14,060
fawness inis milfoo inis milf shoe milf is in milf for you fondula fondula bosom

213
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:20,380
azura daily which is the wrong spelling in french and then finally we got to azura delay

214
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:27,340
oh my god do you know do you see the techniques to fondula bosom as well that's because i approved

215
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:35,500
that name for azura as fondula bosom what was i thinking oh right

216
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,100
okay now this one's about this is a real behind the scenes lore

217
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:51,900
mersey was originally stavitha brave brave what was i thinking and then if she was eastern european

218
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:59,500
we were going to change it to slavitha what was that smoton and then i approved the name

219
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,900
karam bit so instead of karam bit as a sharp weapon bit in french

220
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:17,340
of a male is the literal translation so the fun fact is that it's not a fun fact i'm such a

221
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:25,820
dumbass karam's name got past development so mersey was called karam until about a month ago

222
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:33,660
it was awful absolutely awful don't let me cook ever again i'm not naming anyone after this

223
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:44,620
right acy acy's a lie do you want to know what acy's real name was joy stick with an i

224
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,780
acy was not developed as a polar bear i'm going to show you her developmental are very shortly

225
00:30:50,780 --> 00:31:00,620
her name was joy stick yes that's true now acy umka is russian unbelievably what are the odds

226
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,900
because acy does speak russian but our concept did name was always acy we liked acy from the star

227
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:13,500
okay we liked acy from the star so it was acy umka which i think means bear or paw and

228
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,740
russian i can't remember it's one or the other something like that and then acy's show

229
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:25,020
um for acy hot as in opposites but she was always going to be a polar bear

230
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:34,220
uh and then we got bandar like bandar is that like a kind of mythological angle

231
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,900
and then we got acy snow paws and i was like that's absolutely adorable i love it it's easy to

232
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,660
remember like i know some people are dogging on the names like i'm sorry but we're in english

233
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,860
speaking agency i don't see the point of having like yuku solavia and acy name like in japanese

234
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:02,380
i just i'm like i'm not gonna remember it joy stick chod um me i was pretty quick i knew i was

235
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,860
going to be strongy off the bat i knew i was going to name myself after my dad's gamer tag strongium

236
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,100
it's not his actual gamer tag before anyone worries that like it's a literal thing don't worry

237
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,340
i was always going to be strongy but it was like i don't know where 365 i actually don't remember

238
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,740
365 at all don't remember it spiral swirl notice the check mark against swirl that's because i approved

239
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,060
it and then you know i was a cutler fish and i was like you know what strongy calls locket and boys

240
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,260
and then she be because of her shabari rope she was always going to be she be like she be

241
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,460
um and then we really liked cotton but obviously there's a you know cotton tails a

242
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:46,620
vea so we didn't want to step on anyone's tail you know i'm shining um so we got cotton bud

243
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,140
and then we got cotton more but that didn't work and then we got cotton bum and then we're like

244
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,060
that makes perfect sense because she has a tail if you didn't know three members of veal or have a tail

245
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,900
she's a distant relative yeah honestly it's fine we were not wanting to step on anyone name wise

246
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,380
but yeah as i said emi is not here because emi's name got nailed off the bat i don't care what

247
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,540
anyone says i have never named someone more perfect than emi but i promise you i'm not naming anyone else

248
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:17,580
after this because uh i people are kind of like oh why why the french route um i don't know i think

249
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:29,500
it's pretty easy to remember everyone's name like but clap along with me chat emi ac gb strongy merci

250
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:37,820
that's a rough like these names are not hard to freaking remember in my opinion okay so

251
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:47,100
yeah um okay this is just a bit uh feedback if anyone reaches out to the emails uh the dev team get

252
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,460
back to me a lot um if you are applying to be an editor some people do so submit it we're always

253
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,940
kind of looking for clippers editors so you can submit yourself if you apply and be like hey i want

254
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:06,700
to be an editor right and you don't attach a portfolio or any evidence history of editing

255
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:13,820
or a youtube where you've done like a playlist of edits bro we're not gonna reply you're wasting

256
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:21,100
your time you need apply yeah do not apply with fondle it's crazy right right don't it right i know

257
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:27,820
it was a bad name okay let me let me care um we've had some music creators reach out that's fantastic

258
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:34,300
that do original songs so for the vealer members that want to pursue um singing uh there might be

259
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,020
original songs coming out uh there's a few song covers i'm gonna try and i think shivi has an

260
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,900
interest i'm gonna try and poke zura to do some song covers or maybe some lullabies because her voice

261
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:52,140
is just for it and uh hot to the cleavage right enough to i tried my best but zura was hard to

262
00:34:52,140 --> 00:35:03,020
name but come on zura duly literally um goddess of milk if you will um oh this is the most embarrassing part

263
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:11,500
the first name a concept for the agency was vee sucky and now we are all succubus

264
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:19,500
and the motto would you survive if you met one of us

265
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:28,460
like so the concept was like succubus blood was like seeping into these girls somehow

266
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,820
because i don't like when uh vtuber stories like all connect like me and icy would never meet

267
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,700
because i'm in the water and she's on land type thing like i don't like when agencies like force the

268
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:48,780
lord to come together so a concept of that and i was like no we're not so before anyone makes fun

269
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,740
of veal lord veal lord terrible name we could have been vee sucky okay as in short for virtual

270
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:04,300
succubus so uh i will not be taking any statements and things okay okay you're all done okay this is

271
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,540
just a fun behind the scenes special shout out to yumi yumi works they are magnificent and made

272
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,660
all of our loading screens as you can see these are just the concepts but they're still stunning

273
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:24,380
and it's nice to see behind the scenes stuff but um mercedes was influenced by the joker being surrounded

274
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:34,060
by knives in the batman scene unironically ac if you didn't catch ac's um loading screen is a bit

275
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:46,860
melo melakoli melakoli um where the a the borealis that comes up lights up her thingy but hers is

276
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:55,420
a bit more sad because she's just left her polar bear family mel melakolic isn't colic when babies are crying

277
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:02,140
aurora borealis i always want to say ariola borealis and i'm like i'm pretty sure that means a nip but

278
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,380
i'm trying i'm trying bruv uh she be nailed off the bat um i wanted everyone's mascot to be a part

279
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,700
of the loading screen because i just find that stuff adorable and yes veal lord did premake all the

280
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,380
mascots uh emmy uh elected to change hers absolutely fine no problems like we're not a

281
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,220
dictating agency the girls can come to me and be like i didn't like that i want something else yeah

282
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:29,900
that's fine um uh azura you'll notice did get a new scene that she used on debut um

283
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:37,260
um but yeah this is just behind the scenes kind of this is the oh my god it's tempa fish uh surprise

284
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,900
you know how on debut i was like i have ace more clubs planned with other vtubers yes well tempa

285
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,780
fish is one of them um but yes this is just kind of behind the scenes art just to see how it comes

286
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:56,860
together nah right okay okay this next step so everyone likes the designs yeah all the designs

287
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,780
ten over ten aren't they oh we just love the design we did not

288
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:14,700
we did not look like how we look no okay we do not look like how we look no

289
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:26,620
yeah yikes now emmy and azura emmy and azura yeah uh i just yeah so as you can see ac isn't

290
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:33,740
even in the lineup yet five is me uh i always had bunch uh double bunches in my hair so i have

291
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:39,180
two bunches in my hair like the seashells are just accessories but there's actually two bubbles but

292
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:50,540
yeah sheebie was also with uh triple seas uh azura and thingy but then you know things changed

293
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:58,860
so then the next lineup were like right change up next lineup acsies with us let's go um

294
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,660
uh mersey's hair has changed so she no longer has drills

295
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,420
uh i've changed a bit i've got like these weird spirals in my hair but i quite like that

296
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:18,300
it's quite unique uh sheebie is still purple we're changing you but we do have ac developed

297
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,660
okay we have ac developed now okay change again right body type change on sheebie

298
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:29,660
uh strone complete change on strone mersey again still the wrong hair color

299
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:40,220
and then next okay let's try again and as you can see heights were established and names were

300
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:47,740
established but my height got changed sheebie's got changed azura became taller because we made her

301
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:54,300
a giant test if you didn't know azura can be as tall as a skyscraper now there's not an

302
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:02,380
definite height but yeah um mersey's coming out with a short very shortly about her being

303
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,940
blonde you'll like it um and then here we go big changes on me and sheebie at the same time

304
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:18,540
so sheebie got her hair spirals um her ears concepted and then i started to come to life

305
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,860
um as you can see i have little shoesies on the shoesies got taken away

306
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,180
why am i in a different style where i had to go a different concept ours because we were

307
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,580
struggling at the time um and then eventually ac was getting developed so this that was her

308
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:39,420
first development footage of her model that kind of transition you see there as you see mersey's hair

309
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,700
is still wrong they took your kicks i know they yanked my shoes give me them back

310
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:52,220
actually oh my god i should be like right there we go so we're going to take it from the top

311
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,780
the first girl developed uh what am i doing for time oh i'm actually not doing bad for time

312
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:05,500
let's go let's go that's what i'm talking about um i was good i was good uh right

313
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:14,940
we're going to take it from this top emi was the first conceptualized vealer girl okay but she

314
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,100
didn't look like that at the start boom oh wait wrong one wrong one hold on hold on out wait

315
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,180
wait hold on hold on hold on hold on the wrong one don't don't like don't like no no no right

316
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,500
there we go boom this is the first official concept of emi

317
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,780
yeah that's what emi emi looks like at the start

318
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:43,420
you can kind of see it the she's got the sneakers she's got the the hoodie the hair's orange

319
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:51,340
but uh it's giving it's giving best friendo next door it's not giving emi isn't

320
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:58,300
frankie oh honestly yeah i said squish her down make her a wee one so then we got her

321
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,980
squished down uh we're starting to get her definitely getting her silhouette going on but no

322
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:11,260
pins we do have her uh how you call them uh pumpkins in her hair have been established at

323
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:18,620
this point yeah she got hydraulic pressed and then we're like and back to the drawing board

324
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:25,740
go next what i was like hold on a minute hold on a minute we're cooking we are cooking by gas okay

325
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,180
so we were getting very close as you can see by this design very very close in the concept art

326
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,820
so then we gave her the old overwatch skin if you don't know overwatch sell skins by

327
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:44,620
recoloring them she got recolored uh there we go that was it that was it boom recolored

328
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:52,460
and just like that there's emi that's emi there's emi there she is uh so gave her the old

329
00:42:52,460 --> 00:43:01,340
overwatch skin color change and boom and then there is some behind scenes banner this commission

330
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:07,980
wasn't able to be finished em but i thought show it off anyway this is by papa perrito

331
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:15,420
incredibly good artist sadly ran out of time due to life constraints however i know you won't be able

332
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,620
to tell but this was originally going to be your banner and it's actually a skyrim reference sweet

333
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,820
mother sweet mother sent your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood

334
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:34,140
and fear it is the sacrament done to summon the night mother satan that was her reference for the

335
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:43,340
banner okay up next azura or should i say they say milkerton uh here we go boom okay so that

336
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,660
was her name hardy hardy hard yeah yeah i'm glad it name in so this was her banner concept that ended

337
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:56,700
up becoming her loading screen this is our banner concept it didn't get finished but this is now her

338
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:10,300
new loading fonder the bosom so development on azura was so simple it was easy peasy lemon

339
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:17,420
so easy we had thick goddess straight from the bat we knew we wanted her thick we had horns

340
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:25,420
concept art said fantastic because this is what we got next boom she's already there you know

341
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:32,300
what's different but look at this azura azura was nailed off the bat the most simplest easiest

342
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,620
design honestly so as you can see she's pretty much there so as we progress right something's not

343
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:48,220
right with the legs right okay boom we've now got stirrup thigh highs you are welcome chocolate

344
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:57,580
stirrup thigh high stye words and stuff okay right right what's what's missing hold on what's

345
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:03,660
missing something's not quite finished with her markings yes that makes sense she's a goddess add

346
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:11,660
them markings so nose arm thigh add them markings okay okay we're kicking work again we're kicking

347
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,380
and then oh what was that did you see that did you see that change on the thigh boom

348
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,620
little little thigh things going on beautiful beautiful gorgeous and then next next next what's

349
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,860
next uh i think that's actually an older one there and i was just thinking that and then boom

350
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:38,300
she got her toe rings added let's go toe rings and then we have azura there we go she was uh

351
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,460
i was going to be a milk god

352
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:51,820
night is it very very simplistic very easy very quick uh right please hold on to your hats

353
00:45:52,620 --> 00:46:09,180
because i present to you ac no not that that's that's ac uh yeah that was ac um enjoy

354
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:24,860
okay ac was conceptualized to be an insomniatic gamer okay we kept the insomniatic

355
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:31,580
vibes because if you didn't know polar bears do not hibernate unless they're pregnant so if

356
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,980
see y'all better you better jump off my daughter right now okay she doesn't need to hibernate

357
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:45,420
however please i would like to draw your attention to the pause see those neon blue pause

358
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:52,940
they were supposed to follow her around polar bear pause oh okay so we took it from there we took

359
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,460
it from there yeah that's actually that's where we started and then we got the polar bear pause

360
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:05,580
added in these antenna things and it just wasn't a looking mate wasn't a wasn't a congealing and then

361
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,740
look at that look at the bell the belly button please analyze the belly button for me because

362
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:17,660
there's a little polar bear piercing on her stomach uh yeah originally she was to have a wee person

363
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:25,180
and uh both the concept artist and i were like look it's not working out we're gonna need to be

364
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:33,260
we're gonna need gonna need you to cook so whoa we're changing it up so ac had little

365
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,460
little braids little tribal braids and she's freaking adorable and the top of her shirt's all

366
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,180
ripped up but she has like big baggy sleeves so it's getting very cute it does look a bit sleep

367
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,980
whereas but she had a little piercing as well her little tummy pierce and we're getting a bit

368
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:55,180
closer to ice save you know today and then okay we got another design we've taken away the long

369
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:01,660
sleeve so we're not quite there yet we're not quite there yet hold on hold on okay okay we're

370
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:07,180
getting a bit more primal now look at the gloves gloves glove check glove check okay gloves are on

371
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:16,300
check well they wear gloves at the start but then they became paws mm-hmm so we had a little comparison

372
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:26,220
and then whoa hold on hold on we have paws established we have an ace tape design established

373
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:34,220
very bear esque and then yeah we got we got there so she has her insomniatic eyes on she has

374
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,580
a toggle for insomniatic eyes but she's insomniatic but take a look at her feet they're so different

375
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:46,620
she had open toe boots she had her little toes out but you can see she definitely has clothes at

376
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,460
this part of development but she has scars all over her ripped clothing that kind of thing

377
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:56,780
and and if you really want to zoom in she actually has a tiny tiny cleavage lane because

378
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:04,860
she has a little something there emi is true petan but ac has just a just a little hint of something

379
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:10,620
you know uh oh this shouldn't be in the middle of it but this was her banner concept because

380
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:18,460
she's a little insomniac okay she's a little insomniac she's so tired she's up at 3am so this

381
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,580
was her banner but it didn't get finished uh due to time constraints absolutely no fall of

382
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:29,900
papaparito at all he was fantastic this very adorable banner and yeah as i said the name concepts

383
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:38,140
and then this was her first model uh draft not model sorry like the the the the draft of the model

384
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,660
and we were like or was it no that what that was the first draft and we're like

385
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:51,740
get those thighs thicker and squish her please and then we squished her down got nice and

386
00:49:51,740 --> 00:50:01,740
squished um and then there's isy uh and yeah where she is that's isy cool she was definitely

387
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:09,420
a bit more difficult in development just because we i gave the wrong prompts to the concept artist

388
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:17,420
so that's on me so she took a wee bit longer to get there okay uh for mercy uh please remember

389
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:22,940
her code name was karam i may accidentally refer to her as karam i've called her karam for an

390
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,860
entire year please understand please forgive okay this was a banner that was supposed to be

391
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:35,740
for mercy um it was going to be darkened out and shadowed a lot more but obviously there was

392
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:45,260
a bit insidiousness and in background and uh going on but yes so originally

393
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:53,820
originally mercy had twin tails uh or drills kind of looking thing going on

394
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,780
um but she always had her bow her stomach wasn't showing actually just her mid drift i

395
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:09,980
believe it's a terminology for that um i stole her wig honestly um but yeah uh we definitely were

396
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:20,300
really close to mercy right from the start but she was blonde would it be blonde i know um and then

397
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:30,620
we showed her stomach and it was like okay okay okay and then we got blonde and alterations

398
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:38,300
in comparison but now obviously you've seen her purple so she's purple you know what i'm saying

399
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:45,900
her hair is purple uh but now that i see blonde mercy it does not like it looks wrong to me because

400
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:53,900
it's like that's not how it should be looking um and then we got purple eyes here we're the purple

401
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:03,020
beam right now and then boom we got her mercy starts i've not called her karan by accident in so long

402
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,580
but yeah there you go she was relatively there she was there from the start honestly

403
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:18,460
not too much of a issue you know you can see the comparison um shebe shebe i'm sorry to expose

404
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:29,260
you like this this is the first sign of shebe i'm sorry okay we thought of a rabbit with her ears

405
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:41,020
up okay we're sorry i'm sorry okay i'm sorry i'm sorry okay so you were supposed to have mercy

406
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:49,500
no not fondle of booze i'm this is shebe cotton boom okay we didn't go with the design before

407
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:59,820
anyone said we didn't go with the design relax who said finnaf bonnie that's awful don't speak for

408
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:10,140
the rest of the stream we didn't go for the design so um azura was already established to be purple

409
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:18,860
at this point so we were changing the body tape and then the body tape got changed so she became like

410
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:26,460
the stereotypical milk body type of double bander hips um and then but we're still purple and we were having

411
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:32,860
i'll be honest this was getting really frustration frustration lovely this was getting really

412
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,140
frustrating at this point in development shebe we had been cooking for a bit and we were really

413
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:47,100
struggling like but then we had i don't think these are in order no they're not oh well hey ho so

414
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:53,020
we were having color palette issues i liked the outfit i liked everything about it but the hair the color

415
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:59,260
palette was just not working so i went to a concept artist to very quickly give me a different

416
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,940
pose and we went with two hairstyles let's say give me this hairstyle uh she looks like a

417
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,580
fucking giraffe so no we didn't go with a bloody pony tail she looks like some sort of horse a

418
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:16,380
cheval like umpard like i didn't want a horse vtuber if you want a horse vtuber we ain't the agency

419
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:22,620
for you because i'm not interested in horse girls okay but we got the drills and if you didn't know

420
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:28,780
shebe's drills actually get more red at the bottom uh it's a very small detail very small detail come

421
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:34,140
ride this pony honestly oh that's why you've got a raiden crop you're a secret horse vtuber all along

422
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:40,860
shebe i can't believe it got you in 4k but yeah um as you can see the

423
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,380
gear um it was always a part like the anklet the hand cuffs were always going to be a part of

424
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:56,620
her design and then we got our first model back and we were like uh excuse me where's the thickness

425
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:03,980
like give a sound like this and then you know came along and then hey oh it's so easy easy not

426
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:13,260
it's not the main focus not the main focus okay this was her banner concept uh again banner concept

427
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:19,580
my legs are long these are your banner concepts but uh unfortunately didn't make it to finalize production

428
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:24,060
but this was to be the banner it's probably a bit too much now that i'm looking at it a bit a bit too

429
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,540
a bit too spacey a bit too spacey for youtube was here

430
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:38,380
right my turn womp womp womp there's strong air

431
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:48,940
womp womp there's me strong zoop there we are that's me at the start of development do you like it

432
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:56,060
what do you think is it good is it peak quick i'm gonna very quickly go get a cool look

433
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,460
because my voice is dying give me one second i know streamers are supposed to mute with the

434
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,980
oh i just i don't know if you heard me stand on that but i don't streamers are supposed to mute

435
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,580
i stopped my tool when i left the room that actually really hurt

436
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:31,100
okay so yeah uh my development was different because i was allowed to dictate my design

437
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:38,140
okay so we started with hypnosis and then i was a little splatoon squiddle fish ms paint looking

438
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:45,180
ass you don't watch that you're done you're done okay so i was a squiddle and then so this design

439
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,660
don't write this design off i want to develop this further i love the color scheme i love the

440
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,420
bikini type thing going on um the only thing that kill oh wait i need to open my collar

441
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:03,820
the only thing like i think this might be an all outfit all hairstyle because i love those like cat ear

442
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:08,380
looking things on me and i'll have my little shell on my hair at this point zelda looking ass

443
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:15,580
no don't insult her i think it's really good i really like this design i like the color scheme

444
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:21,260
with the browns and the kind of black thing going on it's good it's good you know lung cook lung cook

445
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:31,100
so i originally wasn't going to have any booba basically because um but then that got changed

446
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:38,940
because i technically have five children with emi and aise and azura and merese and shivi so i

447
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,180
originally didn't have any chest size but then we retcon that because technically uh yeah very big on

448
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:52,300
the dumpy so i had clocks for hypnosis to hang off i always had hypnosis from the star and then

449
00:57:52,300 --> 00:58:03,260
changed the color a bit but then i looked like an xbox so i was like and then it's me but that wasn't

450
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:10,300
this shouldn't be here we're still a bit too early because uh there's one more design that we didn't

451
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:18,460
finish off this is Celtic me um i definitely am getting an alternative outfit of Celtic me because

452
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:25,340
i know it might be hard to tell with the accent and all but i'm just a wee bit Scottish but i try and

453
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,940
annunciate and make sure you guys can understand me so yeah i don't talk the way like you know

454
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:36,540
my accent but i'm definitely getting this developed further the hair uh i like big hair so i'm

455
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,380
probably not going to keep that hairstyle going on but i had like a little ears going on little

456
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:46,940
squiddle ears um but that got developed a bit more this honestly looks kind of a bit reny

457
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,740
reny thorns but if you look at that this is like very Celtic origin and like little symbolism

458
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:57,740
and that that definitely going to develop this because uh it's good but it wasn't what i wanted the

459
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:05,820
the default to be the default that's the word and so yeah i got a thingy my hair probably

460
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:11,500
changed that oh i got that foreign to the Celtic design oh my god i completely forgot

461
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:21,100
well there's my Celtic there's my next outfit boys uh but yeah very very squiddle very Celtic here um

462
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:32,380
yeah uh oh i'm on the wrong one hold on but yes um i was presented with my squiddle eyes here

463
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:37,660
and i actually have a bikini toggle obviously i'm not gonna do it right now because there's not

464
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:42,940
the time for it but i have a pair lesson i have tape over me but you see like i technically have

465
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:52,380
tape over my bits my little bits but if i go back a few um yeah i really like this Celtic warrior

466
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,820
one because i can just i'll just talk about the battle of bannockburn all the time because why not

467
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:03,660
but yeah you can definitely see me starting to come to life here uh like the shell of my hair i did

468
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:12,700
have two bunches but they weren't as big like i have really big bunches um got like and then my eyes

469
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:20,220
so my default eyes were going to be swirls but then i got my squiddle eyes because i'm a cuttlefish

470
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,740
i'm a cephalopod yeah and then i finally came to there's me

471
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,860
uh and then of course finished models okay i'll tell you some hidden things

472
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,180
i'm gonna tell you some hidden things now this is this is what agencies kind of have to deal

473
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:52,700
with behind the scenes azura was conceptualized black okay as a chocolate to be tuber if you will

474
01:00:52,700 --> 01:01:02,860
okay however i came to the horrible realization i can't put a white girl on azura oh my fucking god

475
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:10,220
so azura in development was made racially ambiguous now i apologize for such terminology

476
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:16,620
but that's just how it is that's how the facts are so she was made racially ambiguous if you look

477
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:22,940
back in some of the promotional models and artworks you'll notice how pale she was that's because we

478
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:29,500
had to make her ambiguous okay then azura came aboard and i was like chocolate fire right now

479
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:36,940
like get on it so yes her finalize let's zoom in a little bit on the finalized model

480
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:41,500
just to highlight a few things that are going on with her beautiful design so if you didn't know

481
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:49,660
very quickly azura is your mummy quite literally lower wise she's your mama she is the goddess of fertility

482
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:56,940
on planet earth you heard that right but she didn't want to go to the heavens with her family

483
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:06,140
she wanted to stay among the humans so she has retained some of her powers as a god okay so she

484
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:12,380
has the power of flight believe it or not so she's gonna fly on my deck um i shouldn't have said that i'm sorry

485
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:21,420
she also has healing properties uh with her milk

486
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:31,660
yeah uh she can also be a giant ass as tall as a skyscraper these markings are made from when she

487
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:37,420
founded civilization she has painted nails painted toes she has toe rings on her index toes

488
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:46,380
a little veil over her thigh highs veil in the head all it just hips for days like definitely

489
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,620
kind of the the birthing hips because she birthed humanity like that's the kind of thing going on so

490
01:02:53,260 --> 01:03:01,340
yeah definitely her design was absolutely gorgeous um we had quite a lot of issues i ordered the

491
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:08,220
girls quite a few fan arts once we had the designs finalized there was a lot of issues with artists not

492
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:14,860
understanding the white is her goat ears and they were drawing her like the star wars characters

493
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:21,340
you know those characters that have the like the thing on the front of them we got a lot of artwork

494
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:28,460
of that and i had to send back and be like no she's a goat so go go uh not door like that thanks

495
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:35,980
um asical she's got scars which is a very unique element to her she also has a mouth

496
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:49,340
fang not a tooth fang a mouth fang okay mouth fang she has scars um she has ripped clothing um

497
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:57,420
she also has steel toe capped boots so you know she's safe for work 100% safe for work character

498
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:04,540
she got them steel toe boots on okay um what other attributes she has a tail oh yeah uh azura

499
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:14,060
has a tail and i say has a tail um me oh look at me so i if you didn't know i am wearing a yukata

500
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:20,220
as a nod to japanese culture because without japanese culture truly as v-tubers we would

501
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:27,260
not be here right now let's not pretend otherwise oh i forgot my cover up over my

502
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:35,820
cross i am so sorry i forgot about that part of my design uh i literally have

503
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:54,140
okay i'm sorry i'm sorry but anyway i'm in a yukata uh it's pearlescent so it shimmers as i move

504
01:04:54,140 --> 01:05:00,860
my shells on my head also are pearlescent i'm so sorry i'm gonna just take a little drink of my cola

505
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:12,940
oops but yes i'm a new cat as a nod to japanese culture um for my next alternative i almost likely

506
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:22,060
do a scottish Celtic type origin uh we can see um uh squid eyes yep i am a cuttlefish i have cuttlefish

507
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:29,020
eyeballs uh when we released the eye previews people were surprised but for me if v-tubers

508
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:36,460
just have a regular pupil i sleep i'm sorry but it's like one of the most simplistic things

509
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:47,740
you can design if you give someone a basic pupil as a vtuber boring out i'm sorry that's just my

510
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:53,420
opinion uh it was one of the first notes that i gave to the concept artist do not give me a regular

511
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:00,140
pupil i will perish uh again same with like fingernail designs etc i have french tip uh

512
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:07,100
manicure pedicure the girls all have painted nails mercy also has band aids on her fingers for example

513
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:17,020
um these small things like add up definitely um yeah like i this is just my opinion but i think

514
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:24,700
the there's nothing too if a design gets too complex on a vtuber this is just my opinion as well my

515
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,860
opinion just don't do not fucking represent the company as a whole it's just me being

516
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:35,660
talking at mass okay but um like if the designs get too complicated like i don't know i can't remember

517
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:40,620
what the fucking uh things call but like you know those japanese idol skirts where there's like three

518
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:45,660
different meshes and layers and designs and patterns going on i'm like if you start getting two

519
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:51,180
things you're getting a fan art no one's gonna recognize you because you're x y z like i'm sorry

520
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:56,940
but you can't tell me that our designs look any and remotely similar to clutter that's the word cluttered

521
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:04,140
if the designs are too cluttered please think of the fan art literally like i'd say mercy is the most

522
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:12,220
she doesn't have a cover up we'll enjoy mercy from here mercy is probably the most complex

523
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:21,260
design we have if you want to think of it as layers in terms of fishnet and bandages and all that jazz

524
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:27,580
yeah got strike the balance between not being too over complicated that okay so finally one model

525
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:35,100
that control the full design of uh so if you didn't know she be her hair drills get redder the more

526
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:43,980
bottom you go that's not even a full english sentence um if you didn't know her thighs got

527
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:52,060
chunked up in development uh we went for the classic leg look look some things are classic

528
01:07:52,060 --> 01:08:01,340
and you there's no point don't if it ain't broke don't fix it high heels and stockings if it ain't

529
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:10,220
broke don't fix it you don't need to do anything special anything unique any of that stuff it's not

530
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:20,620
broke it's the perfect design i don't don't even talk to me okay um so obviously my voice is going

531
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:29,340
hold on let me take another drink um i do apologize and say that uh azura and she be

532
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:35,580
you're actually gonna get an update soon to cover up their tappas um because i think youtube are not

533
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:42,380
very happy i tried to run ads on them and youtube said no no no no and i was like but i have my boobs

534
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:50,460

535
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:58,060
is she be designed was just perfect honestly um a lot of people are like hey wait a second why is

537
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,180
is my response to that like

538
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:22,540
like go and just go and just like enjoy the design are you joking me you look at this

539
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:29,580
design and that and you complain about it i'm not a guy okay i didn't have a willy but if i had a

540
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:37,420
willy i know for a fact this is a 10 out of 10 design okay it's aesthetics aesthetic like that's it

541
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,700
like like you're done didn't you didn't you chat about me about these designs emi i'm sorry i had to

545
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:16,460
or is it a marking because she did something funny with a book who knows uh didn't really develop

546
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:23,180
that part of the lore so you guys can pick it's up to you a womb tattoo it lights up no it doesn't

very hard i'm trying to support them in any way i possibly can and hopefully from what you've seen

562
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:18,060
not even to cover the cost so uh uwu market em will take their cut or whatever their you know earning

563
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,420
is and then whatever is left over is profit wise goes straight to the talent it does not go into

564
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:29,660
vealers like accounts or anything like that so please seriously rest assured like this isn't some

sort of money grab agency when you support your talent you support your talent like the talent

582
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:32,620
would like to ask a question in private because i do understand some people are a bit adverse uh are a

583
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:43,340
bit embarrassed uh so ask any agency related questions here agency that's did i even send oh it

584
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:49,500
oh and my toggles are all coming on because i forgot to unbind them from my keyboard you know what

585
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,860
you know what if it wasn't a scoff you wouldn't be enjoying yourself i will take

586
01:14:54,700 --> 01:15:00,860
oh my god i can hear myself twice right let me pin that message right let's see

587
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:06,620
what are the plans for membership streams versus patreon uh let me take my toggle off first

588
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:11,900
um so if you want to support the girl on patreon you will get access to four audios i would like to

589
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:19,500
comment on that um obviously i had to do a lot of preparing in advance it's five dollars to support

590
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:26,780
your girl on patreon for four audios what we are doing is called undercutting the market

591
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:33,100
if you didn't know undercutting the market means you put your product quotation marks out

592
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:39,980
at a rate that is incredibly cheap in comparison to other v a's not only do you get streams from the

593
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:45,420
girls not only do you get alternative content on their all twitter's for free but we have undercut

594
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:51,500
the market on patreon as well so if you would like to test the content that they produce

595
01:15:52,460 --> 01:16:00,780
on patreon i highly recommend supporting them over me because i post free stuff all the time

596
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:06,220
you don't all worry about me okay so support the girls first uh it's called undercutting the

597
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:14,060
market isn't a very nice thing to do but it's uh it is what it is now i did have a few concerns

598
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:21,900
about the type of audios please understand and direct any disappointments towards me

599
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:27,660
because um i did not the girls have shown interest some of them to create the scripts

600
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,780
and roleplays but please understand i had to make sure i'm not putting them in a position

601
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:40,540
where they are overstressed or overworked when it comes to balancing streaming and

602
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:48,300
uh the roleplays now i have made them as straightforward and the girls are welcome

603
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,500
to talk about their experience on stream behind the scenes you know as long as not an nda hence

604
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:58,460
i'm sure they know the difference between like leaking nda content and just being like oh this is

605
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:10,700
how it works okay well let's say five dollars forever yes um i uh believe um i have no plans

606
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:20,940
to raise the price i think five dollars um is an acceptable price i'm i'm very aware of the economy

607
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:27,580
the state that the bloody hangs in and in order to support your oh she deaths that might be in

608
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:33,980
vealer the maximum price you will pay per month i believe is nine dollars and ninety nine cent us dollars

609
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:43,500
for the maximum price of again all content that your oh she deaths produces okay so i wanted it

610
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:49,660
to be as affordable as possible and again that 80 20 split goes across the board your majority

611
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:56,140
is supporting your talent it's not getting hogged up to the agency okay um what will the

612
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:01,740
main content on the youtube channels be streaming we are v-tubers we're just regular v-tubers that

613
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:09,340
offer the goods on the side uh but um please do not think we are trying to speedrun banning our

614
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:16,860
youtube channels um there was a few misconceptions out there that we may do outrageous things please

615
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:22,460
understand uh i'm trying to help these girls become content creators of their dreams help them

616
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:30,460

01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:31,340
the time of day i'm very thankful so yeah uh yeah v and u thumbs up yumi plus thumbs up a lot of

650
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:39,020
vtuber agencies didn't even respond to emails thumbs down like not even a courtesy email there

651
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:45,420
was a lot of theories about why we didn't get a response but i completely get it i'm just

652
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:50,540
freaking me man by the way before you're like oh my god i hate vtuber agencies no it's not how it

653
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:59,020
works um but um off kai clashed with a lot of things i think i offered like 10 000 oh that was it i

654
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:05,420
think i offered a 8 000 to someone and never got response but uh i'm telling you right now if you

655
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:11,180
have a manager that is a barrier between someone saying to you hey i want to sponsor you yeah you got

656
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:20,380
because there was i think we sent 40 managements emails out with the offer inside

657
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:30,540
and like no response crickets and the fact that the 12 k one was hilarious because the original

658
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:38,860
offer was 10 k and then they were like actually this feature were just 4 000 per hour so i was like

659
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:44,140
fine raise our offer to 12 k and then we told her like little thing we're like yeah just react to the

660
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:50,460
girls have uh audio and and they were like we actually recommend not having the video and audio

661
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:56,940
on so more people go into the streams and it was like mate we're paying you 12 000 us dollars

662
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:03,980
and you're you're not gonna do like what we kindly ask which is be a react nd andy for three hours like

663
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:11,820
it was crazy i cannot tell you what goes on behind the scenes absolutely crazy crazy crazy

664
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:18,700
but anyway sorry i was thinking to drink a cola uh when oh all our models have a sleep are you

someone was like what's your average viewership 20 views and they asked for uh

671

01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:19,820
we can all discuss it together azura is the first donathon don't worry azura if you're watching

691
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:36,780
to focus on public rewards i'm gonna burp again oh my god sorry sorry sorry i'm talking a lot

692
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:47,500
um i'm going to be focusing on jenna so the chat going not something i go through you see i fell off

693
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:57,260
my chair sorry um what was i saying uh yes we can work on donathon goes together i will help

694
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:01,420
the girls through it because uh somewhere a bit unsure they've never done one before hell i've never

695
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:08,380
done a donathon before uh definitely gonna focus on public rewards at milestones and this is just

696
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:16,140
me personally uh i'm actually not going for anyone don't care what the timing is but um some like

697
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:22,700
i've seen some donathons and the jump is like 5000 us dollars between like the next goal and i'm

698
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:28,300
like going to be serious can you actually not think of one thing to do for like another 500 bucks

699
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,820
or like another like one of the biggest jumps i saw i think was 20 000 us dollars i'm like you

700
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:40,140
can't think of like one thing to do in between 20 000 us dollars like no we're not doing that here

701
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:45,500
so i'm i'm helping the girls to try and like pick through what to do for donathons and get rewards

702
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:51,660
and all that thing uh i don't know if it was a joke or a meme because it was like pretty crazy

703
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:59,420
um i'd miss this but how does violour make money if almost everything goes to the talent

704
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:06,700
we got so much feedback on that i this is terrible and i can't believe i have to say this

705
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:15,100
but we're not an agency built on corporate greed full stop that's the sentence we don't have

706
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:21,260
corporate greed and the running costs of an agency after you've done the start of costs of

707
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:28,700
buying the models and getting the girls set up for stream is very low it does not cost a lot of

708
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:34,460
money to actually tell the girls to go stream like it doesn't cost me any money right now to

709
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:40,940
click go live and have a good time or to go away and record an ASMR video and upload it i know in

710
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:47,900
this day and age where corporate greed is everywhere around the corner we're not an agency

711
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:53,660
for corporate greed i hope you understand that the 8020 split for this year the next year if the girl

712
01:29:53,660 --> 01:30:01,900
signs on the 15 like the focus on the agency is to help the girls achieve their dreams i know

713
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:09,340
it's ambitious i know we're new and we're just out of the starting gate but i hope no strongy yaw

714
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:11,820
fucking burn the yaw

715
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:19,660
no yaw for me because i don't buddy want one i want the success of my daughters

716
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:26,780
go subscribe to them go give them a chance okay i'm not having none of this corporate greed

717
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:30,780
shit in my house get the fuck out of here without anyway that's just my two cents

718
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:39,660
but yes um the reason why the company and oh and another thing and another thing

719
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:45,260
i'm gonna get started again oh wait i already said that did i already say that the company has

720
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:52,060
been seeded the company is not in debt to banks the company is not indebted to the company has

721
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:59,100
been seeded which means the money was already there it was just funneled into this one okay okay

722
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:08,540
oh what about legal staff are you ready for this fit we don't even have a hr department

723
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,740
we just sexually harass each other for fun yippee

724
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,860
we don't have that kind of business setup

725
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:25,500
is there's no hr so none of the girls can report to me and report me if i say anything

726
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,700
not

727
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:34,940
sorry i keep taking a drink of coal and then hypnotizing you real quick that's true

728
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:40,300
well actually everyone gets paid that was another thing that came up actually

729
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:47,420
um how this is this is actually not vtuber related this is just human related and it's like

730
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:54,860
hey how do you get your um your employees to like work and it was like uh actually

731
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:59,820
pay them above minimum wage like if you go to the girls and go would you rather

732
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:07,580
okay maybe we do slightly maybe have some sort of management

733
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:18,700
i don't run the social accounts or anything like that one guys one guys one guys okay i'm sorry

734
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:27,740
i'm sorry i wasn't saying anything more okay okay i call i call most of the shots i call most

735
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:35,260
of the shots right what was i saying oh right yeah if you're i think one of the it was like the

736
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:40,940
most dumbest post was like i can't get my employees to work hard type thing and it was like uh yeah

737
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:45,500
because you're paying the minimum wage maybe if you actually make them feel like valued employees

738
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,180
which is where the 8020 split came in as well because i'm really sick of seeing

739
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:53,420
vtuber agencies just being really greedy and i was like well i'm the opposite and i get to

740
01:32:53,420 --> 01:33:00,220
call the shots so yeah 8020 time for a black no not the freaking wipe no the black text on the

741
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:05,820
white background oh my god i'm being graduated already oh it was a good run it was a good run

742
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,140
see you next year when i start up the next vtuber

743
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:16,940

744
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:22,380
some money if you want to get 3d models because uh we spend a lot of money just get into this stage

745
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:26,140
okay i'm going to be honest you put your money where your mouth is if you want to see that content

746
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:31,660
vsucky 2026 let's go vsucky

747
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:39,580

748
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:45,180
lesser of two evils and from a management point of view youtube you can manage accounts on

749

784
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:57,340
um i know this may be jumping the gun quite a bit but based on how you think have you already

785
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:05,900
thought about gen 2 possibilities oh that's a good question um uh for the donathons of the girls

786
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:10,940
one of the goals will be revealing a concept art of gen 2 i understand we've just debuted but if

787
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:16,460
i'm happy to be as open as you guys are interested so you're welcome to ask any questions

788
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:24,460
but yeah one of azure's donathons coming up and you guys can vote to reveal a design if you want

789
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:32,140
up to you knock yourself out um someone asked if it's possible we would have a branch

790
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:39,900
um a branch of veller that didn't require the not-safer work audio parts

791
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:44,060
in the nicest way

792
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:55,020
i the cut wouldn't be the same i just i couldn't i can't see it working out everything is based

793
01:38:55,020 --> 01:39:01,980
on what i have learned over the span of many years of what is occurring tan cute and funny i bet

794
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:09,580
she okay i will tell the plan later you can tell it on your screen if you want to

795
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:22,540
um will the patreon uploads be dictated by the talents no the content is given by management

796
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:26,700
i actually have a script manager coming in place soon for the girls if you have any

797
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:32,940
audios that you don't like please direct your grievances with me at this stage and then you can

798
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:38,620
grieve at the manager that's coming in because i can't be our stealing all the scripts um

799
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:50,620
yes the girls are not pigeonholed into one category of audios that would be impossible

800
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:57,660
to get them to succeed and that is just the truth of the matter i understand that some of the audios

801
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:04,460
might not play into the thingy but i can't have polar bear shags you polar bear shags you again

802
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:10,060
polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear be in every single audio

803
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:18,220
please be realistic with me that's not gonna appeal to the masses and at the end of the day uh these girls

804
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:24,060
are wanting to move out they're wanting to save money for their futures they want to pay off debts

805
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:34,620
possibly this kind of thing so please please be realistic with us okay thank you i do appreciate

806
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:42,780
them um is there a way to submit scripts for the talents possible plausible at this point in time

807
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:49,260
i do not have a system in place like that it is plausible in the future you'll have to let things

808
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:55,020
things need to kind of we need to level out and we need to um how do you call it we need to like

809
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:58,700
settle down the dust hasn't settled literally we're freaking day

810
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,460
um all that kind of thing um

811
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:11,340
how likely are what our off club how likely are off collabs based on location

812
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:21,500
you mean like the girls meeting up i can make it happen i get taxed back on their travel expenses

813
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,620
i can make that should happen if they want um

814
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:36,540
you said violour does not require the girly pops to get permission for various projects

815
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:41,660
uh how about showing face no i don't really recommend it for him well

816
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:47,580
uh so isn't male collabs you'll never guess what one of the unwritten rules of ours are

817
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:55,260
uh wait ain't gonna be any males on this how do you pronounce violour

818
01:41:55,260 --> 01:42:03,180
well i'm scottish so the word like alluring you're alluring violour but violour but if you

819
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:08,140
ever come from a different place yeah like feet cam hand cam that stuff's fine the girls don't need

820
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:14,780
permission for that uh you'll never see my face fill stop and i'm a feature yeah i'd say probably

821
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:21,900
face stuff is like i'll never i'll never stop the talent but um

822
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:24,620
um

823
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:33,740
oh this is a good question have you started the agency on its own or did you get any

824
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:41,660
sponsors or investors nope so when the agency was becoming an agency uh there were actually

825
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:48,460
multiple offers for like split ownership and that kind of thing the last thing i want

826
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:55,500
is anyone meddling with my girls so absolutely not i rejected them all i have absolutely no

827
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:03,980
interest in anyone else having anything to do ownership wise other than knowing that the girls

828
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:12,700
are in my good hands okay uh there was also whispers of like oh you can sell this this business on

829
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:22,300
if it gets big eh and let me stop you right there i trust myself with these girls i do not

i'm just throwing away eh but yes don't worry

833
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:59,420
eh why go with patreon over other locations it is safe to link patreon on youtube as long

834
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:07,820
as everything is behind of paywall there is a large established market on patreon if there

835
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:15,020

837
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:34,620
eh what are your plans for the future of violour um for me personally it is helping the girls

838
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:42,460
achieve their dreams a lot of them were interested in 3d models um definitely do that there's a few

839
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:46,780
that are interested in a few song covers i'll help them pursue that maybe with their own original song

840
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:53,180
but my goals are the girls goals um and if you mean my actual personal goals i'll talk about that in

841
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:59,980
2.0 but my goals are the girls goals yeah i want to help them be successful and be happy um yeah good life

842
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:10,380

855
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:47,100
we had like we were together for two months before we debuted and the weirdest thing ever

856
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:51,340
was like uh instead of like their meetings where like the girls got to know each other

857
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:55,260
i was like right let's go play among us together for the first time

858
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:03,100
uh so we were like freaking a zero was absolutely smoking us so i'm going to recalibrate my little

859
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:11,260
hold on my mic okay there we go my mic's a bit better than my mic um yeah we had to like

860
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:17,740
do four something like for your game let me try to say to like make everyone comfortable around

861
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:25,980
each other yeah we played like whiplash um this game where like you can i can't remember the title

862
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:35,900
of it but it was like really good it was fun um sorry i just had a little

863
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:43,660
jackbox that was it we played like jackbox together and stuff um are the girls free to

864
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:52,300
collab whoever they want yes asterix as long as i've no got a willy i don't care who they

865
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:58,540
collab with they can go nuts for all i care why are the girls so cute is that part of your hypnosis

866
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:06,620
have i trained you trained you to like the girl uh how open to marriage suggestions are you from

867
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:13,260
friends like design ideas and such go for it but the you know this this agency's kind of

868
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:20,300
i'm gonna i need to word my words carefully word my words carefully i am i need to word myself

869
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:28,460
carefully but most like i want to say most agencies aren't so open and taking feedback

870
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:34,700
whereas like i want to say like hey we've literally just started of course we're gonna

871
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:41,740
fuck up here and there something's gonna go wrong but like we're open to suggestions like oh i think

872
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:48,540
this is a good idea i think that's a good idea you know like i want to say that so

873
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:59,500
um someone says do the talents own the games on the steam account oh fucking course

874
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:07,740
did you buy the game surprise surprise you get to keep a very very very hard concept for

875
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:16,220
some people to comprehend but yeah the talents if they buy it they keep it crazy concept i know truly

876
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:26,700
mindfongling who came up with mersey's design everything is by squishy girl the website is getting

877
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:31,340
an update it's actually taken quite long to to produce the update because there's quite a lot

878
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:37,900
of information that's going to be in it so give us a a hot second to produce it um

879
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:46,700
supposing that someone has an edit in portfolio can they apply for a video editor

880
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:54,460
yeah uh clippers editors um i want to try and do a clipping program where you get money very like

881
01:49:54,460 --> 01:50:00,700
idle i'm not even gonna like say otherwise idle do a clipping program where if you clip the girl

882
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:05,980
every thousand views you get a dollar type thing i'm quite interested in that style because

883
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:11,900
you're not forced to only clip us you can clip whoever you want on the side and obviously

884
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:16,700
you don't need a wee bit of money to come back in before i can do something like that but i really do

885
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:23,580
like the concept of it very good wellness very good wellness um i like it very much

886
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:32,700
uh

887
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:39,500
sorry i'm just i'm just reading some of the questions i can't say out loud as i read it

888
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:47,820
because it's you know um sorry i'm reading i'm reading just in case

889
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:56,380
uh hold on hold on i'm reading i'm reading i'm reading you guys are just saying inappropriate

890
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:03,580
stuff about sorry the the the the the comments are like i would do this to ac i would do this to

891
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:11,820
me and i'm like but that's not a question about the agency how long did it take to get the hired

892
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:21,340
selection progress process oh my god oh my god you've just activated my neurons so the the

893
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:31,660
application pool was open for a month and then the way the twitter said like in 48 hours or

894
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:38,140
something you're gonna get an email and someone was like oh my god there's no way they're gonna

895
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:47,420
go through all those applications in two days no you idiot you numpty of course we were going

896
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:56,460
through the applications as they came in you genuinely thought that when they close is when

897
01:51:56,460 --> 01:52:04,780
agencies go through them come on rub those brain cells together

898
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:14,780
you genuinely think that agencies close applications and then start going through them

899
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:22,380
no add a freaking battle royale tier system going on for the girls goodness gravy

900
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:31,180
goodness gravy some of the comments come on me i'm no very smart myself but the moon man you're

901
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:37,660
taking my pass are there rules surrounding clipping the talents absolutely not go nuts knock

902
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:44,700
yourself out thank you because it costs a lot to pay for clipping um will you ever hire

903
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:50,620
programmers sadly i don't need a programmer let's just fix a

904
01:52:54,140 --> 01:53:00,860
battle royale tier system okay right i can i can talk about this so as the applications came in

905
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:08,460
i found a girl that was suitable i would pick out the model for you and there was first place

906
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:18,620
second place third place but the choices were so like obvious to me if it made sense like

907
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:24,860
emmy was emmy i see was i see you know like the choices were so obvious that it was like

908
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:31,740

909
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:37,500
bullshit approach to interviews so and the girls can talk about it if they so desire i basically

910
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:42,300
went into the interview with them and i said eh right off the bat i said hey

911
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:47,580
we want you as a talent you absolutely do not have to impress me in this call

912
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:52,540
okay you don't have to impress me i want you already here's a list of stuff that you

913
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:58,460
need to know before you sign on if you want to sign on okay did you have a lot of candidates

914
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:03,660
for fondlet no a zero was the only like there was no one else for a zero if zero rejected that

915
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:12,540
position i was up shit creek i'm not even fucking saying nothing yeah angry scottish is more

916
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:22,700

917
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:33,420
are you going are your models gonna stick sorry are you and the models stick to these avatar

918
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:39,980
eh you mean like new outfits and stuff no the girls can get new outfits or 2.0 or whatever

919
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:44,620
or 3d models perfectly fine with me um

920
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:54,060
eh are you ever worried about your relationship with the girls considering your gen mates and a

921
01:54:54,060 --> 01:55:01,820
boss funny you mentioned that i told them in the interview don't call me boss don't refer to

922
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:08,540
me as your boss do not think of me as your boss i am not your boss don't ever place me above you

923
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:18,060
mentally in your head i do not want that i am the creative director wink wink so they do not call

924
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:25,740
me boss they do not call me superior yes she be called me boss mam and i was like no please don't

925
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:31,420
ever like do that because i don't want anyone thinking in their head like oh my god i can't

926
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:39,900
approach her i can't talk to her no i don't want that i don't like them i don't want anyone to

927
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:48,540
ever think that i am superior to them in any way unless it's their kink i said it i said it

928
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,660
um

929
01:55:56,140 --> 01:55:57,980
let me check let me have a refresh

930
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:07,020
yeah um also at the end of the day i'm not really a boss anymore like now that debuts are over

931
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:13,740
everything's like up to the girl the only boss thing really is like hey have you recorded that

932
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:21,500
audio for patreon yes or no and then that's it there's nothing else to it um

933
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:33,100
so yeah leader yeah uh basically just tell them like hey i did this and i'll show them stats and

934
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:37,500
stuff and i'm like this is what i think you should do but they don't really ask for advice because

935
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:43,740
uh i'll mention i'll repeat this again all the girls have more streaming experience than me

936
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:49,660
so it's really hypocritical for me to be like hey go stream this go stream that no i have full faith in

937
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:56,220
these girls uh they are absolutely fantastic lovely everything i have absolutely no problems

938
01:56:56,220 --> 01:57:03,100
i have complete faith in them and absolutely nothing is worrisome at all so yeah

939
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:15,820
she goes live in eight minutes hold on let me get confirmation that i raid into shibis 2.0

940
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:24,220
um for those of you who would like to part ways and join shibis 2.0 please absolutely do

941
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:32,060
uh i will also be doing my 2.0 at the exact same time but i am in uh i highly recommend you do

942
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:41,180
shibers sheasters um because she is nothing but an angel and uh i would love you to support

943
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:48,300
my daughters over me this is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth what's my 2.0

944
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:53,500
i'm i'm gonna answer questions about myself and stuff but this is kind of more agency focus

945
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:56,220
yeah

946
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:01,500
um someone asked do you have plans for auditions for gen 2

947
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:10,220
okay we debuted yesterday unless you're actually interested in joining the agency that's different

948
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:19,020
um the we were a year away from my focus is on helping these girls achieve their dreams and seeing

949
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:25,180
where we go you know you need to let let they've literally just been birthed from my lines give them

950
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:32,780
a chance to like you know get their their knee joints working and all that jazz yeah let's

951
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:50,940
everyone cook first but it's it's a year away um that we're okay any questions on youtube because

952
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:57,980
marshmallow drying up like my voice box honestly whose voice is it my voice

953
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:06,060
um you've invested a lot of money into this understand that the marriage goes to the girls but

954
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:16,860
how exactly do you recoup your investment me i keep 100 percent of what i mean uh yeah don't

955
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:21,260
don't worry about like thank you very much for worrying about investment costs and stuff but

956
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:29,420
like this this is a big this is again not for greed this is for me to do my thing and i have

957
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:34,460
five lovely girls who i also recommend and i want them to be able to do their thing

958
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:42,140
and yeah let them cook man don't don't worry about the money okay don't worry about the money

959
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:48,860
some things in life are more important than greed and i don't mean you're implying that i'm greedy

960
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:55,340
because obviously everyone wants to return on investment if you will but let's just have a good

961
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:59,180
time like i'm playing assassins creed tomorrow i'm going to tell you about that some of the

962
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:04,620
developmental lore of that game i'm going to tell you a little tip bits about glitches that occur in

963
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:15,260
that game i'm just here for a good time okay uh when was velar started uh it's been a one year

964
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:23,900
development uh actually i'm gonna give you the name of the song the girls were uh i was the girls

965
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:42,060
were consented but oh god this is the song sorry i just completely went off in my head

966
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:52,620
this is the song the girls uh were birthed to one year ago this song so open that up in a

967
02:00:52,620 --> 02:01:00,620
oh should be started is we should restart it should be started okay okay are there any games

968
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:11,660
that can't be played uh for legal reason no because we're not a japanese based company

969
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:18,220
we don't have to worry about that copyright shit that other agents she's really fucking tied to

970
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:21,260
it's not a rick roll yeah

971
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:32,220
so that's the song that the girls were made to so you can give a listen to uh i am going to end

972
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:38,460
