0	2000	I'll click the word
7440	8940	Huh?
8940	10940	Yeah, that's a lot
12360	14360	Ugh, what an outrage
18360	21360	Who says she hates us? I ain't even booted up yet
21360	22860	Sheeeesh
22860	24860	Sheeeesh
25360	28360	Oh, I fucking got obsidian over there in the corner
29360	31360	Testing
31360	33360	What are we flanking?
34560	36040	Test done
36040	38700	Waiting to see if I get the results I want
42040	48680	Okay, you know how I know I've gone live because every time OBS YouTube prompts
48680	52840	The YouTube prompts me to say now's the perfect time to put an ad in
53320	57480	At the start of stream you think that's the perfect time to keep viewer retention
58320	60320	Greedy greedy greedy
61920	66200	So I have just been delivered the news that my poor
67000	73680	Clapping without my hands ASMR has been taken down, which is such a shame. I'm currently writing the tweet about it
74880	80960	And so we can I'll read out the tweet that I'm currently writing about it. I've done like a little screenshot
81520	85840	And it says I'm shocked in brackets. I'm not
86440	93640	This is an outrage in brackets. The only outrageous thing was the video idea and the fact I even created it
94720	97880	And then I'm gonna put I feel like this is
98560	100560	unjust
101560	103560	And just for
103760	109500	Jumping up and down for 15 minutes making my cheeks clap
110520	115040	Yeah, yeah, I'm just these nuts in my pants
115960	117960	And my trousers
118440	123120	This is funny is this humorous or is this not
125360	128900	It was a good video how long did it stay up for I
129920	134080	Timed it so it came up for hours ago. I have no idea how long it stayed up for
146080	148080	Like an hour, okay
151080	155160	Well, I am now an even more ASMR debt for the
155680	159280	Subscriber count because I've also apparently passed 8,000 subscribers
159800	164040	Which is terrible news because it means I know how oh seven ASMR videos
165240	171480	Yeah, Azura can't eat a cookie. I'm not allowed to jump up and down and whatever happens happens man
172360	174360	And
174680	176360	So
176360	178360	Something that is yeah, truly
179120	182460	Right. I'm gonna quote tweet my little beauty
183400	188760	And then I will pin what world we're in which is seven. No, it's not it's 388
189480	191480	please
192360	194360	I
196160	201600	Just need to make sure the content your content was removed due to a violation the community guidelines
201840	204800	What do you mean jumping up and down and making math?
205240	207560	None hands clap is a violation
208840	213520	Because it's your first time. This is just a warning, but how big is again your channel's gonna get a strike
213520	217440	And you won't be able to do anything for a week. All right. No, we ain't risking a strike
217440	219440	I got I got a stream record to break
220440	223720	Second strike will prevent you from publishing for two weeks three
224360	230280	Strikes in any 90-day period will result in a permanent removal your channel. Well, I will admit
230280	234400	That's a wee bit dramatic for a bit of cheeky calm
234400	238640	I'm wondering if it was the heavy breathing at one point in the video. I
239840	244600	Went up to the mate and did it so I was breathing heavy
244600	246600	I
247760	253200	Wondering if I was a guy would it be different because obviously female breathing bad bad
253840	257480	male breathing possibly fine question mark. I don't know
258360	262400	because guys heavy breathing is like grunting and then that
266160	270360	Yeah, that's what it is because the actual clapping segment
271240	275520	Maybe I am just absolutely just too far gone
275920	281160	But is it outrageous of me to say the clapping segment? Honestly, it wasn't that bad
281160	286820	Like I just sound like I'm doing a workout and it's like what women aren't allowed to work out on YouTube. Wow
287320	288200	YouTube, that's right
288200	291680	We have to we have to play a few cards here so we can get the chit in the video back
292040	296240	Wow YouTube, that's despicable women can't even breathe and
297320	299320	2024 talk about 1984
300360	305760	I got a couple of 40 years ahead, but I guess not all boo you to boo
308400	312000	All boo time to get YouTube slimed, right?
315520	320560	Let me just check the the actual screenshot doesn't have any information that we want you to stay on YouTube
320560	324720	So make sure you understand and strike review your content or policies every view
325320	329760	Right nothing says Johnny cut was legal name so I can post a screenshot
330520	336120	Understand the strike will expire. Yeah bear expire, right? I've posted it. It's cringe and
340640	342640	Holy shit I
342640	348200	Have I was this I I did not get a lot of sleep last night because I was busy doing
349280	352880	Business business business. Um, oh my goodness
353880	358400	Who the fuck says it's hard to like talk to v-tubers are not in I
360440	362440	I didn't believe you
363880	371120	I spoke to two different. Oh wait. I have a timestamp on the video of why I got taken down and before it's the breathing hold on
372840	375640	The video is loading it's gonna show me what part
375640	377640	I
379360	383560	Was the breathing in the air? I knew it was gonna be the breathing in the air
383560	388720	I knew it. You can't you can't breathe on YouTube anymore. What is going on?
389800	396040	Son bizarre says and I've disrupted the buddha tea and factual content policy
396040	400680	It says audio content that's actually be bliss it is not allowed on YouTube
400680	404480	We may make limited exceptions for content that have educational documentary
404480	408720	You know what I should have started that video by saying I knew it was the breathing
408720	410720	I knew it was of course breathing
411280	414120	Oh, and I need to take should I submit appeal?
415480	417480	Submit appeal
417720	424800	Well, it's a bit. No, I can't put a message in the appeal explaining that I'm a man, and I'm just a man breathing
425080	426600	No
426600	431480	YouTube the only downfall you need to let me explain that I'm a man
432080	440120	I'm a man. Let me breathe. Okay. Well, it's not happening, but we are gonna take the YouTube training
441400	443400	We're gonna take it live
443920	449200	I'll read out what I can see right now. SIGI uploads content of people using
451440	455920	That is a violation I can't even read that out. That's how much of a violation that is chase
456440	463400	In an official music video for a record labor a singer walks through the streets of a carnival the singers costume
463400	465400	consists of a bedazzled
465400	468080	And and it cut and it covers everything
468080	472080	No, it's not a violation because music videos can get away with everything
473080	479480	Remember when Belle Delphine uploaded her music video and I got taken down and then everyone was like hold the
479760	481760	phone a minute if
482120	485440	Nicki Minaj can come out here when nothing but
485920	489160	A bit of tooth floss. Why can Belle Delphine not do it?
489160	495280	I don't know if you remember when that the internet was in complete uproar and then Belle Delphine's video actually got restored
495560	500760	Because YouTube had to back off and admit that record labels had the most
501360	504760	Favourable upload terms. Hey, there's nudity in some in
505600	511840	Some music videos as well. There's just straight up because the record labels can get away with it
512440	514440	Yeah, well, we're actually on the subject
515680	523560	YouTube didn't think I forget all these little violations you do against the community. I'm in the know. No, you I'm in the know, right?
524920	529400	Brian manages a museum YouTube channel each episode is a different tech
530160	531640	topic about
531640	537280	Ancient Japan at one point Brian shows a painting from the 18th century in which people commit
538080	541000	She explains wait, I thought said Brian
542800	549440	She explains the name of the artist the title of the painting this video doesn't violate the policy because it's giving
550560	552560	information about stuff
553680	555680	Check
555960	561240	Yeah, I'm not even reading this stuff properly a movie has a bench all seen in it
561240	563240	Which the lead character are in their
563800	570320	Undies the characters get into bed and under the covers they participate in inking a
570680	577040	Fan uploads a reaction clip of the scene the video description has the name the director lead actors the year
577040	578840	It was produced and there's nothing
578840	581920	Bexwell about it. No, this isn't a violation then
584360	585280	Okay
585280	590240	Fat question five of seven. We're almost there. We're almost there five or seven
591080	596320	Tyler uploads a video from his Safari vacation where he saw two lions
597320	604360	Meeting with one another what he films the meeting and from afar titles lines meeting in the world in the video
604360	611640	Description he describes the type of lion. No, it's not violation. It's just a discovery channel question mark. Yeah, that's correct
611640	618240	Okay, I thought that a comedic prank channel uploads a video in which the creators test how far they can throw different
618760	622480	Objects after throwing different types of food. They start throwing
623160	625160	Bexwell boys a
625920	627920	And of all sizes
628320	630800	This video violates because it uses
631280	633560	Bexwell boys isn't allowed
634360	637520	if the video violates policy because
638200	640200	The video doesn't violate policy
642360	646720	It doesn't violate because the toys aren't being used the way they're supposed to
647520	652680	Hello and before I got it right. I got it right. See I knew I say everyone wonder
653320	659240	How do you know YouTube things as well? I don't have one limited ads video nor stream
660840	662840	That is the gospel truth
663920	667680	It turns out my let me hold it didn't violate the
668400	671720	Ads policy and it's not limited ads. Well, I'll get right
674280	680680	Sorry, sorry, I'm trying to get right to say a news organization uploads a segment about
681320	683680	Spanking. Oh wait, I just said the word anyway
684040	691200	They show adults engaging in banking with clothes and different devices from hands to whip the video title and description
691320	696360	Explain the talk and who's engaged topic and who's engaging in the act within the video with the news reports
697120	701720	Prevides in-depth detail about the bettish and the science behind it
702360	704360	it doesn't
704880	709480	It doesn't violate the policy because it's
710240	712240	Educational check
714520	719240	We've got a seven for seven nice work. You've completed the training
719240	724760	We appreciate you taking your time to help us keep YouTube safe. I'm the one that's a menace on YouTube
726040	729240	Oh, I just I just burped and coughed at the same time and
730120	735320	Your warning will expire on the 19th of September. Wow. That's a long punishment
736080	741360	If you violate the policy again, you're just straight up get a strike if you violate a different policy
741360	744760	You'll get a warning for the different categories of policies
745880	747880	well

819440	823640	Oh, but Stranny if you stream longer than two hours technically
823640	830280	It's an endurance stream because less than two hours is the average reach of your stream time, right? Okay. Well, I get your point, but
831640	837640	The long and short of it is I've probably only got four hours or we're gonna redirect into another veal or girl
837640	840080	Okay, I have no idea who or what streaming today
840480	843840	So actually well, I'm at it. I'm gonna check who has actually stream it

1112840	1120280	So I just want to say special shout. Yes a she clipper. I'm leaving kidding actual woman moment. I can't believe it. Um
1121560	1126200	I just want to say special shout out to anyone who uses youtube's clip
1126600	1131720	Feature if I ever do anything funny mildly humours. Let's be honest. I'm no funny
1131960	1136440	If I do anything mildly humorous that makes you blow a little bit of air out of your nose
1136520	1142600	Please use youtube's clip feature. I can see what you clip and it basically means I can pass it on
1143080	1143880	to
1143880	1150280	The the the lovely lady. Um, I might actually introduce you to her if if all goes well
1150760	1158120	Um, but I mean she has an outstanding portfolio. She's worked for idle and you know those like super hyper idle n click

1175880	1180920	Clipper debut when oh, she's fantastic. Honestly the portfolio is insane
1182040	1186120	Um, and they also do highlight reels if I wanted a highlight clip of something
1186120	1191880	So I might ask for buckshot roulette highlight, but I don't know how busy they are. I had to message
1191960	1195320	Oh, I guess I'm like so I feel so cringy when I mess up like
1195800	1199240	Hi, I'm strony cuttles from veal lure

1210680	1212680	but I don't know what your
1212680	1218040	Your rates are as well as if you have any new client spots because if you didn't know most people
1218520	1219560	When they're established
1219560	1227480	They most likely have a one-on-one editor highlighter that does everything like consumes the content and produces it for clips type thing
1227960	1234200	And I was like, I don't know if you have any space and she replied back and followed me instantly and I was like

1471080	1472360	Um
1472360	1479080	For that you've actually you pretty much paid off the concept artist. Um for that kind of money. Um
1480920	1482920	There has been
1483480	1488520	Aces hips exactly there has been a mild update now. I keep it on the download
1488680	1493080	Don't want the don't want anyone to be upset, but um, there are two designs

1497800	1499800	Pretty much accepted
1499960	1501960	um
1502040	1509080	We just need the artist the modeler the modelers already been contacted. We just need to see what their thoughts are what they can do
1509320	1514040	Um, we're looking into possibly custom poses
1514680	1516520	um
1516520	1518120	for
1518120	1520120	each girl it's um
1520280	1525240	It's an interesting thing to do. Um any hints, uh
1529560	1535880	I don't think I can give any hints mercy actually is very familiar with one of the designs. Um
1536200	1538200	I
1539320	1542520	She actually got quite fond of one of the concept designs. Um
1543960	1548680	But I don't know if she wants to talk about it or if I should let her talk about it
1548680	1555000	Because it's like a design that doesn't even I have I am going to see if I can get the girls to
1556360	1558360	Um
1559880	1561880	I'm like the girls to what
1562120	1564120	I
1564440	1569880	Five thousand subscribers actually I think we're all approaching five thousand subscribers, you know that
1570520	1572760	Sorry, I'm trying to do like oh, sorry oops
1574440	1576440	Let's do 14
1577880	1580280	How does it know to do 14 I never told it to do
1581400	1585000	Uh, I think the girls are very close. We actually have celebratory
1585960	1587960	Art work when everyone hits 5k
1588440	1590440	Azura and icy are coming up
1590520	1594840	I'm actually going to get them to do an ASMR video which I think will push them over the edge
1595560	1597560	Obviously Azura we're having a
1597880	1602680	So we can't put up Azura's meme video yet. Um, but that will definitely help boost Azura a bit
1603000	1605000	But I am going to send
1605480	1610280	AC and Azura on their merry way to create me an ASMR script and I'm going to get it up
1610440	1611960	Is up
1611960	1619400	Um, because I truly in wholeheartedly believe the girls can clear 5k easily in their first month. Um, I
1620120	1622120	I'm going to see
1622840	1625080	Um, emmy the freaking hard worker
1625960	1631800	She made a thumbnail because her and ac are actually doing a audio collab, which is fantastic
1631960	1637720	It is going on emmy's channel when she's away on holiday. I can say that emmy broke the news
1638280	1642440	She going on vacation. Okay. She's going on vacation
1645160	1650520	And she updated her youtube profile picture so she looks so menacingly evil, which is hilarious
1651320	1655240	Um, it's actually I will say one thing now don't get me wrong
1655480	1657880	I'm sure a lot of management's wouldn't like this at all
1658440	1663000	I like coming online and being like, oh what he's done when I've been asleep
1663400	1670040	And it's like, oh right. Okay. Every changed her profile on youtube. Like, oh, that's cute. That's sweet. Um
1671080	1672600	ac made a
1672600	1676840	Oh emmy made three, uh, twitter audios. She absolutely did
1678520	1680520	She she gone for it, uh
1681080	1684680	Pin pals, I do not know what you've done to my cute innocent little sister
1685000	1691080	She was not like this in the interview stage and I'm getting scared of her. Her power is growing and uh,
1691560	1694040	Yeah, it's uh, I'm starting to monk us over here. Okay
1695000	1696520	Innocent
1696520	1700280	You should have seen her in the interview. She was nothing but polite sweet
1700520	1703880	She was actually the most inquisitive question wise
1704440	1711400	Um, you know asking all these different aspects and like, uh, one of the funniest. Oh, I felt like such a flex
1712280	1717160	Felt like such a flex. Oh, she was like, how how's the company funded now?
1717160	1725000	It's like the company has been seated. There is no debt. The banks do not own the company. The company is self-owned
1725560	1732280	Oh, thank you for asking that question emmy. I'm humping on I'm gyrating on my chair right now
1732760	1736760	Oh the flex. Oh the company's seated. Oh
1737880	1743000	Absolutely, I don't sorry. I'm a bit too energetic for first thing in the morning, but oh
1743960	1745960	Oh, how satisfying
1746360	1752200	Anyway, I do do love me a little interview. I hope the girls couldn't attest that the interviews are probably the most relaxed
1752280	1756120	Interview they'll ever get in their dying lives. Uh, because it is so unprofessional
1756840	1761000	I'm like, hi. I'm scottish. If you can't even understand me
1761480	1765880	Just just ask me to repeat myself and they're like now. I understand you. I've heard you before and I'm like, oh
1767160	1769160	You're not supposed to hear me before
1769800	1771080	um

1841720	1847880	I literally rolled out of bed 10 minutes. Well 10 minutes before streaming can't be 10 minutes ago because I've already streamed for longer than 10 minutes
1848920	1850280	um
1850280	1852280	Yeah, literally
1852520	1857720	Uh yesterday was a freaking dream. I was like, oh, sorry you want to trade with me? Hold on

1878360	1885480	Oh my god, you evened it up. That's amazing. That's actually amazing. You evened it up. You're like, no, no get that get that going
1886360	1892760	Uh, but yes yesterday was a fever dream. So I was like, uh, isn't it hard to like
1893320	1897880	You know talk to other v-tubers and stuff like why is it because you see so many tweets that are like
1898280	1901640	I'm so shy of meeting other v-tubers
1902600	1908440	Reply under this tweet and I'll get back to you. I'm like, oh, it's actually that hard to like kind of message folk
1909720	1914520	No, I just sent follow requests. Uh, and then low and behold, uh
1915000	1919720	Some girls followed me back and I've asked for two ASMR collabs like a cheeky shape
1920280	1923880	And complimented the girls because they've been so nice. Uh, and I've seen their content
1923880	1929640	I'm quite impressed by all their content on that. Uh, so I've been a cheeky shite and asked for two ASMR collabs from two different
1930600	1931880	agency v-tubers
1931880	1938040	So I don't know how everyone's fucking greeting on twitter being like, it's so hard to be nice to folk
1938280	1941000	If you go in there and state your business boom
1941240	1945480	People it's almost like people reply instead of the hey, hey, we're both v-tubers
1945960	1948440	No, if you're both v-tubers that doesn't they make you pals
1948760	1953720	That's like saying all postmen of the world are best pals because they deliver the post. No, that's not how it works
1954280	1960600	Uh, I think I think all those tweets are folk going hey and someone's dms and they're like, I can't be arse with you right now
1962280	1965560	That's my only like that's the only thing I can ascertain
1965880	1971160	All right, just spell my name out sin. I'm not even asked you for an ASMR collab yet
1972360	1981080	So you can't even not sin it's actually so sin's really easy to talk to literally I was like, sorry delaying your thing for a
1981640	1984200	A couple of weeks because my dad's coming over and she's like, oh fuck you
1986040	1988760	And we've got like shot colors on standby. Right. Let me finish this
1989000	1991000	Oh
1993880	1996680	99 prayer after cutting you must be joking
1997320	2000760	I bought membership for this by the way and you can do wines for free
2001560	2004920	I'm so sorry if I tricked anyone into buying runescape membership
2005240	2010920	I thought we were gonna cook like those little weird starfish. Oh, where am I going? I don't know
2011320	2015560	I've gone over here now for some reason. I don't know how I perfectly collect that bank
2015720	2021560	But I'll come back over refunds. Give me a second. I just I wanted to collab with my
2024200	2031320	My favorite is a married man. You get your succubus ways. Oh away from him. She hates this. I don't I'm just dumb
2031320	2035400	But I actually miss click. I don't know how I perfectly miss click that that bench though
2037000	2038760	Um
2038760	2041560	If you didn't know sin sister
2042280	2044360	79
2044360	2047320	70 freaking nine. That's fantastic
2048200	2050200	um
2051000	2057560	Sin is actually a retired succubus. Yeah, that sells a one. Oh, oh, oh, right. You want to start with? Oh, that's a no
2057560	2059720	man. All right. All right. All right. Um
2060680	2063800	Literally level 79 we're getting there. Um
2064760	2066360	If you didn't know sin
2066360	2068120	sister's lore
2068120	2070120	is actually
2070120	2074360	She's a retired succubus and if you look at her loading screen
2074760	2079080	If you may have never noticed this because I didn't notice it until like the 18th billion stream
2079080	2084600	I had watched of hers. I was watching her supermarket stream a while ago. It's fucking hilarious, honestly. Um
2085720	2092520	Her loading screen has the person that summoned her dead on the floor with a smash keyboard over their head
2094120	2099400	Look at that next time you see her loading screen because I never noticed that detail for the longest time
2100520	2104040	After cooking it should be construction. So so shawty can design a cute house
2104440	2107560	Always gonna play hide and seek in the house with you guys
2108520	2112520	Monka is literally sin. That's our father-in-law. How could you?
2113960	2120680	Um, but yes turns out communicating with v-tubers is really easy if you just don't waste their time
2121000	2127240	So, um, if you are a shy v-tuber that is lurking in the shadows and you always want to collab with someone
2128200	2130200	Just say hi
2130680	2135720	Just say hi name. I'm this person from this agency if you're from an agency
2136360	2140920	Uh compliment them and say that you uh something that you enjoy about their content
2141160	2148200	Um, so it shows that you're not just like messaging them to collab like it shows like I've actually consumed your content
2148280	2151560	I've appreciated it from afar. You know that kind of level of thing
2152120	2153320	um
2153320	2158760	And then just say hey, this is what I would love to do if you don't have time completely understand because you're incredibly busy
2158840	2164760	It is that easy peasy. No, I think we've got enough wine and grapes. I'm gonna be honest
2165400	2169640	Oh, we're getting steaming on the kebab. Why is everyone giving me a kebab?
2170920	2175080	Is this my breakfast? Thank you for feeding me reflin. I got a kebab
2179640	2182440	I think I have enough now that keyboard
2183400	2185400	Literally, literally me
2185720	2192760	Uh, and while you're at it, didn't you upload breathing ASMR by the way? I got a violation for clapping my cheeks
2194120	2197560	In an ASMR video apparently it lasts it was up for an hour
2203560	2210040	Um, I pretended to put in an appeal but uh, yeah, it's not good. It's not happening
2211000	2216520	It is not happening at all, but hey, hope that's it's how the cookie crumbles
2217880	2221640	That's how the cookie crumbles. I literally missed it. I'm pure raging. Don't worry
2221640	2227080	I'll send you the audio custom for you baby cakes. It was literally me like taking my I kid you not
2227080	2232760	I took my prel off like my weaponry um and uh my plate skirt and all of that
2233480	2239080	And uh, I basically got coconut oil and started jumping up and down which creates a clapping noise
2239320	2242520	So I called it clapping without my hands ASMR and no
2244120	2248520	I think it's hilarious. I don't care what anyone says. That's the funniest idea. I've probably ever came up with
2249000	2251720	Um, and I will never be able to top that
2252440	2254120	Uh at all
2254120	2259320	So unfortunately my ASMR debt has increased to seven videos yet again
2260520	2266920	So I wasn't there. I was there. It was great. I do apologize for anyone who missed it. Um, I
2267400	2268600	I
2268600	2270600	For you for those who missed it
2271560	2273560	I will buy premium
2273640	2278280	On my alt twitter so you can listen to it for free. Okay deal
2279400	2281400	But in return

2336600	2340520	Uh, hold on. Oh no
2340520	2342520	Oh
2345240	2350760	Where's the uwu market freaking oh for folks sake, I don't think I can search right now
2351320	2355800	I'm supposed to have a little icon up right now. That's like hey guys
2356200	2359240	I have merch from uwu market and it goes in the corner and it's tiny
2359240	2365000	But I can't find the freaking link in the chat. Can someone repost my links
2365480	2373080	From the uwu market pack. I can't see it because i'm live right now and uh discord is
2374120	2378520	In streamer mode and I ain't got the balls
2379080	2386360	To take it off. Thanks. Thanks. Maybe question mark, but don't worry if you're busy girls
2387000	2389000	I know
2389640	2393080	I know you work hard kiss
2395000	2397000	Absolutely
2399480	2404520	Um, there's a new vtuber agency that's popped up and I've already forgotten the bloody name of it
2404760	2411000	And the fucking owner of nexus follows me as well. I was checking out his follow man. I'm like, um, this one on here
2411080	2413080	What's going on here? Um
2415560	2424040	Uh, no not socks but shout out to socks agency. Um, the owner of socks agency is actually super cool. Um
2424840	2432600	He sockified all the girls actually so I should probably tweet out about it. Um, but I'm terrible at marketing and all that kind of thing
2433400	2438280	Uh, no, no, uh, there's a new feature agency. What's that called? It's coming up
2438600	2446360	They've revealed the designs, but they've said it's not like the finished version of the designs. There's four girls to a generation. Um
2447480	2452360	But it's really interesting like I'm here. I'm sorry, but I'm here rooting for the underdog
2452440	2459880	I'm here for these new agencies these like crater owned agencies like I think it's very clear like, um
2461320	2465960	You know people are getting a bit sick up and fed. Um, is it sick up and fed? Yeah
2466920	2471560	People are getting isn't that shit postage? Oh, no, no, no, I weave it's a bit shit posty
2472040	2475480	But um, I got to like basically
2476360	2480360	It sounds silly. I got to interview the uh, the sock puppet agency
2480920	2482920	um, but um
2483320	2488840	You'd be surprised how like uh, based it was like behind the scenes. I'm be I can't say anything
2488920	2493480	But it was very surprising to hear the motivations behind the agency and that
2493720	2498520	so then it'd be surprised if I'm sucking on sock agencies toes or anything like that because so is a
2499080	2502760	I've seen everything I've seen so far. I like and I've actually got a
2503480	2508280	Two girls that were pre-established in one new or starting fresh. I can't remember
2509000	2513000	Hey there. Hi socks is actually making it real. Yes
2513880	2515880	um
2516200	2517160	Uh
2517160	2518680	Small corporal piled
2518680	2524600	I think people are getting a bit tired of the endless new wave new wave new wave
2524680	2528440	This'll this'll help new wave new wave. Well, we have a stock market
2528520	2531720	Oh, we actually like care about money at the end of the day not the talent
2532280	2538120	When people can see right through that you're only here for money with your talents and all that and these are
2538120	2541880	Real people these are real people with real lives real issues going on behind the scenes
2542440	2544840	uh, people get tired um and
2545240	2547240	Stains start getting die die
2548040	2552440	Die gets casted and stains remain you cannot wash away certain stains
2552840	2558680	So it's very interesting to see now. Don't get me wrong. Uh, your agency's tiny stroney
2558920	2563800	You're using even 5k yet fucking relax right mate fucking relax. Jesus christ. Um
2563880	2565000	Um
2565000	2570680	Like i'm actually going to do a short which is controversial. It's terrible. I know are you ready for the short?
2571160	2573800	Uh, but but burn the yacht
2574520	2580200	Oh, no, you said but the yacht. Sorry. Uh, sorry. It's a bit programmed in me to burn that yacht for some reason. Um
2581720	2589960	I actually am doing a incredibly controversial. It's not controversial to me. Um, because there's a very popular youtube short
2589960	2592200	And it goes how much do you v-tubers make?
2592840	2595560	Um, but obviously inside the short no money
2596280	2598040	Is mentioned at all
2598040	2600920	So i'm going to do the controversial thing after a month
2601000	2606040	I'm going to show how much I earn in a youtube short so people can get a grasp of like
2606120	2609560	Hey, this is how much you can earn if you put your whole pussy into it. Um
2610600	2613480	And it'll be very interesting to see what the response is
2613560	2619800	I feel like the response from people who aren't really a fan are going to be like
2620520	2622520	Uh, or this is
2622920	2629720	This is an obscene amount of money and then the people who are like, holy crap. You're killing it type thing. Um
2631480	2638120	Yes, I did enjoy a short from grin pen rose that was like how much do v-tubers make sorry to name
2638680	2640680	them directly
2640760	2644120	But it was like if you're going to title that and not tell the money, bro
2644200	2649560	Let me let me cut to the fucking chase and i'll show you how much money i've made. Okay. Let me cut to the chase
2650120	2654520	Um, and i'll do it since everyone's so shy to be like, yeah a surprise surprise
2655000	2659320	I actually make money. Uh, I make a livable income with what I do type thing
2660040	2665080	And before anyone's like, uh, you're just flexing your money. Oh, that's just like showing off your money and whatever
2665080	2670440	I was like, no, I still like that either you you get a short. That's all artsy farts saying like all
2670920	2675400	Oh, you'll never know how much a vtuber actually makes or you get my short where i'm like, this is how much i made
2675400	2677400	This is how it works. Did it did it like
2677960	2682600	You're trying to pick pick pick your path. Okay, because it's not even a path of an illusion at this point
2682680	2685640	It's like either you want transparency or you want artsy fartsy
2686040	2687000	a
2687000	2692440	Watching a short for a minute and don't even get the answer to the freaking thingy flex that money strony you deserve it
2694120	2695720	Um
2695720	2698760	Yeah, revealing the secrets laws. See I don't
2699880	2703800	I don't think it's like bad or anything, but um
2704200	2706200	Yeah
2707560	2710040	Edging versus releasing in short
2710840	2712120	No
2712120	2714120	That's hilarious
2714120	2717480	But it's true though. Why like I was gonna do a short
2717640	2720840	That's like a breakdown of the model prices and everything
2721320	2725160	And because there's so many like how expensive are vtuber models?
2725480	2731640	And then it doesn't say how much the model freaking costs in the end and then it's like oh, but toggles are expensive
2731720	2739240	Toggles are additional fee. Yeah nice shit toggles are additional expenses because you have to get more artwork for it
2739400	2746200	You have to do different calibrations for it. Like just tell us if oh i'm getting so angry i'm burping
2747000	2756040	Just tell us tell us stop. Stop freaking edging us on vtuber like shorts. Why?
2757000	2762600	Why am I like I shouldn't feel like i'm like having to freaking get blood from a stone
2763400	2767320	How much are vtuber models and then oh it depends on your budget?
2767400	2770200	You can also get these free ones as well and it was like, okay
2770360	2776440	Well, thanks for absolutely nothing like i'm gonna do a big breakdown on the model prices of the girls and all of that
2776920	2780600	Azura actually I have a short for her to make but I need her voice
2781320	2782360	um
2782360	2785000	I was basically gonna do like guess how much
2786040	2791800	Are vtuber models costed or like who is the most expensive vtuber model at valer type thing?
2792360	2795640	And then just reveal all the prices basically
2797800	2799800	Yeah, I don't like the freaking non
2800120	2802120	I don't like the the the
2802280	2807640	The short being a question and then the short doesn't even answer the question now. Don't get me wrong
2807720	2815160	I understand that is that is content 101 you suck them in you give them a non answer and then you scroll away
2815560	2821880	No one has time to be angry because your attention span is already gone to the next video once you've finished it
2822200	2827320	Agencies hate her for this one simple trick. She actually tells the behind the scenes
2827880	2829480	um
2829480	2835000	Like I my I sent the short girl. I'm not gonna say her name until like I know all is good
2835000	2838120	And she's fine if I mentioned her name being my editor T
2838840	2845480	My not my editor being my clip clip editor that I commissioned. I she doesn't belong to me
2845560	2849160	Okay, she doesn't belong to me, but she's I think she's Australian actually
2849640	2851000	um
2851000	2854520	Not me sending messages at 4 a.m. So, uh, anyway
2855160	2856760	No, um
2856760	2858840	You play it safe. Well, they get it. Yeah
2859160	2863800	And before my like straightforward shorts flop, but if I did an edging
2864280	2868920	Uh one where I'm like, I don't tell the tell the full story. It gets like a cabillion views
2869000	2870600	I can see that happening
2870600	2875480	But yes, I actually need to borrow Azura's voice because I'm going to get her to do a
2876440	2878440	How much do veiler
2878520	2884520	Uh models cost. Actually, there's this really popular sound right now and it goes. Let's go gambling
2886040	2888040	Oh dang it
2888040	2888920	Oh dang it
2888920	2895720	And I was gonna do that about opening up a VJ for agency and it's just like bank account goes down artists over deadline
2896360	2898360	everything pushed to the day before debut
2900040	2907320	Unlimited unlimited stress unending stress like that kind of thing. Um, but I need to make it. Yeah, they're like, oh dang it
2907800	2911800	Oh, I was gonna do that and like a really quick breakdown of what it was like
2912600	2913720	um
2913720	2920360	But yeah, I was one of them have a commission done in having a commission done on time impossible literally
2921080	2923480	There's like this jigsaw meme where it's like
2924040	2928120	Uh and for your last challenge have your girl go and it's like, oh hell nah jigsaw
2928680	2935720	Um literally that but for artists complete your complete your uh commission on time even though you've been given ample time
2936360	2940280	Sorry, but I cannot tell you I feel like I have been very fair with what uh
2940920	2944520	Timelines I have given people and like nothing happened. I'm going to lie
2947160	2948040	Oh
2948040	2951800	Forgive me reflands. I do love a good run in a ramble. I really do
2952280	2958200	Um unlimited stress. Well, literally if you ever want to be stressed fucking open up a VJ for agency
2958280	2960280	It is the perfect
2960520	2962520	Perfect amount of stress
2962520	2967160	You could do that self-deprecating applying a corporal short with be allure is jackpot. It's true ready
2968120	2970120	Um
2971480	2973480	Yeah, I
2973800	2977240	Oh, maybe I should do like controversial ones on purpose where it's like
2977880	2979960	It's like we want to burn the yacht
2980120	2985720	We want earth like I want to see girls actually get money that they're given like I want them to have good cuts
2986280	2990840	But then I feel like everyone will be like and you just hate bg sandy. No, I don't hate bg sandy
2991320	2994840	I hate corporate greed. You are you are crossing the lines
2995800	3002200	Sistens you are crossing the lines. We don't like corporation greed out here. That's it. That's literally it
3002440	3004760	I love the insider. Yeah, I think it's terrible. I know
3006040	3010520	Since that you could use a massage. Are you offering refland? Hmm. Are you offering?
3011880	3018600	I have just clocked your fucking profile picture. It's a refling with ryan gosselin in the picture. That is hilarious
3018920	3023160	I've changed my setup so I can see you guys better without my glasses on
3023720	3027480	Um, so I can actually see your profile pictures now like I can see
3028200	3030200	um
3030440	3034120	Like what your profile picture consists of a lot easier now. Yeah, he drives by the way
3034840	3041480	We don't like the yacht man in the end part. No, like I understand business is business. Don't get me wrong, but
3042440	3045880	um, I think with how personal and
3046760	3048360	kind of non-tracks
3048360	3051000	Transactional streaming should be like
3051560	3057320	You know how like I always get sensationalized that like this girl demanded from her viewers
3057400	3062680	That they give her a five dollar sub and she says they're all cheap asses and all that kind of thing
3063400	3065400	um
3065640	3067640	type idea
3068040	3069880	um
3069880	3073000	Like it shouldn't feel that transactional
3073240	3077560	But when you have a corporation behind it that makes that transaction
3078120	3083880	So apparent that releases their stock that releases public notes about meetings and all of that
3083960	3084840	I'm like
3084840	3087640	Mate you're just asking for trouble. Like I don't know if legally
3088040	3091160	Japanese countries. Sorry. I really struggled to say that there
3091560	3095240	Uh, Japanese countries like have to release these insider notes or something
3095320	3101080	But what's going on and what's with these claims that like they're hiring 16 year olds for their pr team or something
3101080	3108120	Like I don't know what is going on. I probably shouldn't even talk about it because I'm not educated enough to talk about it
3108600	3115960	Um, and I will acknowledge like hey, I'm not educated. Like I probably shouldn't be but like the you know, you know
3116920	3118440	you know
3118440	3125000	Um, it's a smash and grip if I'm am I mistaken in saying there's a new hollow live branch coming
3125560	3129480	Uh, but they were like forced to interact with the male hollow live branch already
3130440	3133880	Japanese laws are messed up. They always favor the corporal. Hmm
3136920	3143000	Yes, I think the rise of content creation owned agencies is definitely swapping in
3144600	3146120	Um
3146120	3150040	Debut tomorrow, I think really that's fantastic. I wish them well
3150920	3153400	Uh, there's no reason to believe they were forced to
3154600	3156600	I thought they I thought yeah
3156760	3158760	Oh
3159880	3161880	Well, uh
3162040	3164040	Curious curious if they weren't forced to
3164920	3166920	Of course, I don't know about that
3167000	3172760	I have reason to suspect that not all their tweets are their own tweets. Um
3175320	3178280	So I actually wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even them
3179160	3181720	Because uh, depending on how generic the tweet is
3182280	3189400	Me I'm not I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. I feel like that curate. Mmm. Oh Hannah. Yeah jigsaw. I see two again
3189800	3191800	That's it. That's the meme
3192280	3196840	There's a lot of stuff related to japanese corporate structure and how they do things. Oh my god. I
3197560	3200840	Do you guys ever watch like paulo in japan?
3201480	3206520	He does like behind the scenes of what it's like to work in like japan and oh my god
3207880	3209880	Oh my god
3210200	3216040	These people do not even have time to breathe and the drink culture is so heavy as well
3216360	3220280	Like if you don't go out drinking with your co-workers after like a 12 hour day
3220920	3222280	um
3222280	3229320	A 10 foil scrawny. No, it's not. It's real. It's documented. This is it's actually documented and you can access information at any point
3229400	3230440	tee he
3230440	3231240	um
3231240	3235160	Literally like if you don't go out drinking with your workmates after a 12 hour shift
3235400	3239240	You're considered to be like a bad sport. You're not a team player
3239640	3247320	At least youtube won't ban. Oh, right. Oh, okay. Okay. Remember that time I breathed into the microphone and I got a warning for it
3247640	3249720	good times
3249720	3253640	That was such a I'm sorry. All I'm gonna say is that video would have went viral
3254120	3257560	I would have got a cheeky 40k views on that video if it was left off
3257640	3261880	That's all I'm saying because everyone would have been like what's going on here. Oh, hey, yeah, jigsaw. Bye
3263000	3266200	Don't even get me started. I started as a um a beachy fan
3267000	3271800	So literally every corporate beach where I watch save for one leave in the company because of stuff going on
3272520	3279560	Yeah, no way. There's a lot of unspoken rules in etiquette. So that's absurd would um, we don't oh, no, I don't want to oh, no
3279560	3281560	I'm too late. It's too late
3283160	3285480	Ah, it's too late. I got 30k bomb feels good, man
3286040	3290680	I would want to live in japan, but the work attitude would perish me. Yeah working yourself to death
3291160	3297240	Is quite literally a thing for corporate. Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't relate to that. I want to retire in hobbiton
3297880	3299800	I want to tend to
3299800	3306200	Me flowers. I want to tend to my veggie patch. I want a lovely hearth in the evening when it's cold
3306520	3309880	I want to let the fire warm up the room and
3311000	3312920	You know have some cheese
3312920	3319880	and meat and crackers and fall asleep in my little lounging chair in front of the fire then giggle when I wake up and like
3319880	3324360	Okay, I should probably go to bed now and then I stuff out the fire like that that's
3324920	3330520	This is what I if you ever get asked. Oh, what's your ideal job and then you go
3330840	3332840	I do not dream of labor
3333000	3339160	That is 100 percent valid and please do not think you are weird otherwise for not naturally
3339800	3348040	Gravitating towards one specific job. It I have terrible news. You're actually not hardwired to want to do something like that
3348760	3355480	Um, you I don't know if there's evidence for crop hardwiring because of you know about a full crop is
3356120	3358120	You know good for you these bots coming in
3359000	3361400	They kind of look like bots. I ain't going away
3363720	3371960	A full pantry and a full belly and off to snooze land ago that this is what oh, sorry
3372120	3375240	This is what I long for a simple life truly
3375800	3383560	These are all bots or altkins for smithing. Oh, there must be a smithing mine. Oh, wait, there's a furnace right there. I see
3385720	3387720	Uh a full womb
3389400	3393160	Base give me the simplest job possible and I can forget about it when it's done
3393800	3396600	Literally, um, like I've kind of said this
3396680	3402120	I think I'm gonna get into we like ASMR pop-up shop or angle back into education and all of that
3402680	3405480	Because like I don't dream of doing nothing
3405800	3410440	But you know if you're able to remove the stress of like, oh my god, I don't have enough money to pay bills
3411080	3411800	like
3411800	3412680	Bruv
3412680	3416440	You're on cloud nine like imagine just being able to completely
3417160	3422360	Like understand that you can walk away from your job at any time like if you get treated like shit
3422680	3425880	Who benefits who benefits from poverty?
3426760	3432360	Business owners because people will put up with shitty conditions people will put up with overworking themselves
3432440	3437400	People will put up with workplace abuse, which is rife across the board actually
3438120	3442280	The bullying doesn't stop at high school. It does not stop at high school
3442600	3446200	Workplace isolation slash bullying is very much a thing
3446600	3451960	Um, so do not ever be embarrassed if you are ever a victim to it. Don't ever think oh, we're all adults now
3451960	3457400	I shouldn't have to go through this. You're right. You actually shouldn't but some people never age never
3457960	3459160	mature
3459160	3462920	past that high school mentality of you're slightly different from me
3463240	3465960	I will treat you differently because of that aspect
3466280	3472200	I feel I feel uncomfortable because you're different from my persp- persp- perspec-
3473240	3474920	of normal
3474920	3476520	like
3476520	3481240	Money doesn't buy happiness, but cover poverty causes the depression poverty
3482120	3487960	Poverty begets poverty as well as the system putting place up against you. So like that fucking
3489240	3493080	Where's that tinfoil hat? Oh, I could actually go on one. Um
3494680	3498600	Yeah, like did you know they also set the fuel prices for regions?
3498680	3503720	Did you know they purposefully set the fuel price in american region higher than they do for your
3504040	3511480	Europe they came together in a council to do this. This is public accessible knowledge like poverty begets poverty
3511960	3513960	If you don't have a car in america
3513960	3515240	Fuck you
3515240	3522120	You can't go anywhere because they don't even have uh, how you call them. I think you guys say sidewalks
3522280	3524280	There's not even pathing
3524280	3530360	There's not even pathing to walk to work if you so desired and we're so lucky to even actually that reminds me
3530360	3532200	I saw a video of this guy
3532200	3538360	Whose house was right across from his work and he chose to drive to work because he couldn't get
3539000	3544040	He couldn't physically there was no intersection. There was no traffic lights. There was no way across
3545960	3547960	We live in a society
3547960	3554920	I can't believe that every runescape stream just turns into me complaining about society. Oh, but strongy strongy. What's your solution?
3555400	3557400	What's my solution?
3558040	3560040	My solution
3560280	3562280	You ain't gonna like it
3562360	3565640	No one's gonna like it because I actually don't have a solution
3565960	3570600	The thing is we have a disease on our hands
3572920	3574920	And we have to treat the symptoms
3576600	3582120	But how on earth do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured?
3584360	3590440	How do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured?
3590520	3593000	There is a patient in the bed right now
3593800	3595800	That is resisting
3596360	3600760	Every single ounce of medication you could possibly administer to them
3601320	3603320	You have a syringe
3603800	3605800	They move out the way
3605800	3607800	of that syringe
3607880	3609880	You try to put in
3610440	3614920	You try to give them a tablet they cough it up behind your back because the string
3615240	3619960	Because you can't be watching them. You don't have the power to watch them for 24 hours
3620040	3622040	You need to go do stuff. You know
3622680	3625240	You try to put an ointment on their back
3625960	3627880	It gets wiped off
3627880	3633320	It's allowed to stay for a couple of minutes, but the ointment is wiped off the patient remains sick
3633400	3637960	The symptoms are present. The disease is still there. How do you treat that?
3638600	3640280	We don't know
3640280	3642680	strongy bringing the tin foil. Is it tin foil time?
3643720	3645080	For now
3645080	3647080	Veiler will do its best
3648040	3650040	That's what sectioning is for
3650600	3656280	There's a very famous ultra corporal bro that graduated from my uni made as
3657000	3660920	Very needed medicine go from like 25 to 1k. Yes
3662360	3665560	I am loving the success stories
3665960	3670600	I believe there is a pharmacy that is currently on the rise in america
3670600	3672600	I cannot for the life of me remember it
3672920	3678760	But they publicly said our markup is like I think 10 us dollars whatever you purchase
3679240	3682920	We make a 10 us dollar profit on that's it
3683000	3687800	That's all we ask that covers the infrastructure that covers the insurance that covers the business that covers
3688520	3694680	Everything of our business. We have a markup of 10 dollars. I cannot remember. Oh shit. Did I get an xp bomb?
3694840	3697480	Ah, sorry too busy running again
3698440	3699640	Uh
3699640	3703880	44 000 xp bomb. Wow. We're almost at 80 feels good, man
3705400	3708360	Insulin yes the patent for insulin
3709080	3711080	The gentleman that created it
3711240	3715160	I I apologize his name evades me at this moment in time
3715320	3721560	The gentleman sold the patent for one dollar because he believed it should be in the hands of the people if you have type
3722520	3725080	One diabetes you were born insulin
3725960	3727960	Resistant you can't do a thing about it
3728040	3734360	You rely on insulin if you are type 2 you can reverse this through diet exercise change
3734360	3738520	But you must be incredibly careful and use your doctor's advice in order to um
3739960	3744520	In order to revert the effects that type 2 diabetes has caused
3745000	3751000	But insulin patent was sold at one dollar and now is an astronomical fee
3751800	3754760	I have heard of horror stories of people passing away
3755480	3757480	No one in my opinion should pass away
3758040	3759240	for
3759240	3766120	Diseases um that are out with their control. What do you mean? I believe in health care for all. Oh, is that controversial?
3766200	3768200	Yeah, relax. I grew up in scotland
3768360	3772680	Medicine is free if you didn't know medicine and health care is free in scotland
3773240	3774440	um
3774440	3779080	But think about the odds exactly. Um, I actually uh almost
3779320	3780440	that
3780440	3783400	I may have almost broken the law twice in australia already
3784280	3789640	Excuse me for being a a bad girl. That's right. I'm a bad girl. You want to hear my bad girl story?
3791080	3792200	I
3792200	3797880	may or may not have had to get medicine just for a few things or another like beta block or that kind of stuff from my heart
3798440	3800360	um and
3800360	3804760	In scotland you do not pay for your medications. You go to the pharmacy
3805160	3807880	You hand over your prescription and you walk away with it
3809400	3810680	I
3810680	3812680	I think I may have already told this story
3812920	3820520	The look of horror on and shock on the man that was serving me when I started to put the medication in my backpack
3821560	3829000	He he couldn't even get any words out because he had never seen such blatant theft before and I was like
3829720	3833720	Do we have to pay that? I was like like do the australians pay
3834280	3835720	for medication
3835720	3837560	and he was like
3837560	3840520	Yeah, you need to go over there and pay for it and I'm like
3841080	3842680	Oh
3842680	3844360	Sorry, uh
3844360	3847160	In scotland, it's free and like he laughed it off
3847480	3849960	But like the look in his face was like
3851880	3854200	And then I also did it twice
3855000	3858200	And another pharmacy, so I'm probably on a list to be honest
3858600	3860600	I started walking out the shop and I'm like wait
3861000	3867160	Wait a minute because like I could see the receptionist looking at receptionist the cashier looking at me
3867240	3874200	Like with eyes open. I'm like I had to like fucking go up to the desk. I'm so sorry. I'm scottish everything's free in scotland
3874840	3879800	I feel like repeat and then they always like they're like wait what all medication is free. I'm like, yeah asthma free
3880360	3884760	Asthma pump. No, you don't get asthma for free asthma and healer is free
3885720	3891240	Insulin is free. You need iron. You got iron deficiency free if on prescription
3891480	3894600	You need vitamin deficiency free on prescription like
3895080	3900520	All of it free and everyone is always so surprised whenever I explain that I'm like it's free everything's free
3900920	3905640	If you're born with ailments ailments or experiencing illness, it's free
3906760	3912120	You shouldn't have to pay to make yourself healthier or to make yourself at the optimum that your body can handle
3912440	3919000	Some folk come out a bit messed up. That's okay. Here's some stuff that'll help you get through the day
3919240	3922920	You know, some people aren't built for you know a classic nine to five
3923000	3929160	Some people are built for being a nice little cozy home bed because their body's all messed up and that's fine
3929240	3932280	That's just the way it is asthma for freak. No America's
3932920	3938440	America Australia's most wanted literally cannot stop thieving medication
3939240	3942520	You can't he stopped me man. Can he the actual can he stop me?
3944600	3947560	If you have to pay for anything at all it's usually a pittance to
3948520	3953000	Cute room. Oh, did I bring strong it was bragging about this mythical land of scotland?
3953560	3956360	Do you want to hear another mythical fact about scotland?
3957080	3959640	Our national animal is a unicorn
3960120	3964200	I'm an iron horn. Yeah, this isn't an iron horn
3965720	3967720	For scotland. Yeah
3967800	3970920	It's a unicorn. It literally is look up right now typing
3971560	3975560	Scotland's national animal and tell me it doesn't say unicorn
3975960	3979160	It's a unicorn made up country. It is a unicorn
3980600	3984920	Don't tell me I'm I'm not fibbing. It's a unicorn. Yeah
3986280	3988920	They are unicorns are quite name. Um
3989720	3993800	Our national flower is a thistle, which is a purple
3994760	4000120	Flower, it's a very unique looking flower. Um, it is spiky. So don't get too close to it. Um
4001080	4002600	I don't know
4002600	4004600	I assume the thistle has
4004680	4008200	Cross continents by now and you you guys have seen a thistle
4008760	4012680	Seeing unicorns is seeing unicorns as everyone is on the mushrooms
4013960	4015240	Bre
4015240	4019720	I don't know who decided that they're like, oh, we're gonna pull a little prank on them prank. I'm John
4022680	4027480	Made up animal for a made up country. No. Oh my god for real. I love scotland. Yes
4028200	4034840	You probably wouldn't think a magical horn to create your typically seen on children's lunchboxes, but it's true
4034840	4037320	The unicorn is the national animal. Yes. I'm I'm horn
4038280	4039880	It is true
4039880	4043000	I'm not telling fibbers. Okay. I'm not telling fibbers
4043560	4045800	prank I'm John. Oh, I love that prank. I'm John
4046520	4049800	When are you coming to uh, why are you combining dutch?
4050280	4057080	Uh, when explaining is there German history in scotland? No, there's actually a lot of history between the netherlands and scotland
4057080	4064280	When it came to the cotton trade, um, if you ever have the pleasure of going to bruge, um
4065240	4068920	Do not be afraid to take the touristic boat canal rides
4069080	4077080	Um, they explain all these like cross-reference of history and apparently scotland and the netherlands were pretty hand-in-hand at one
4077080	4082680	Point which was really nice. Um, don't ask where the netherlands actually sourced the cotton from
4083720	4085720	Our bell jump for that matter. Um
4086440	4088440	But, uh, you know all went well, um
4090040	4094680	Hello, hi for anyone joining. I'm just going on another rant again about society
4095160	4097160	Hello about us living in a society
4097160	4102360	Also that I may or may not be a wanted criminal in Australia due to the fact I can't stop stealing medicine. Um
4103960	4105960	Because it's really hard to
4106680	4108680	unlearn everything
4109640	4113480	And it's like hard to unlearn like oh wait medicine costs money. Oh dear
4113960	4115800	We don't ask those questions
4115800	4117800	English is a germanic language
4118280	4124280	Someone said netherlands sourced some and yeah, uh, does netherlands. Oh wait, of course. I'm german when I say that
4124680	4127960	netherlands mensen. Oh you praten netherlands for me
4130600	4132600	Wait, do you say yeah
4133000	4134760	No
4134760	4136760	Yes, yes
4138040	4140280	No, what's yes in dutch?
4141240	4143240	Pratic
4144920	4149320	My beloved is a kleptomaniac steals your boy cherry. What you gonna do about it, huh?
4150360	4152360	Oh, maybe we should have a thief design
4153480	4155480	Oh
4156280	4158280	That would be interesting
4159960	4161080	Um
4161080	4162280	English is in a language
4162280	4166840	It's three dialects in a trench coat honestly. This also is beautiful as a wild flower. Yeah
4167240	4171000	The cherry seed is it stealing if it's a willingly offer?
4172360	4176520	Boy cherry. I just love that term my boy cherry
4177640	4181000	My boy cherry. Oh, yeah, your boy cherry
4181480	4186280	Wait, what are you going to do when a five two scott breaks into your room asking for the boy cherry?
4186520	4188520	I
4190040	4192040	Shawnee cut was wanted for
4192200	4199160	Wanted for 8.06k counts of ink theft. Honestly. I just give up damn straight
4200440	4204200	Damn straight. I've broken you well, even though I've not even gotten started
4205560	4208600	And you're right. Actually, I had the right to ace more clubs
4209160	4214360	Because I've left two girls on red, but no, I have ignorance out of me being a dumb dumb
4216840	4222840	Sorry, my boy cherry is with another woman. Sorry less. How dare you?
4224760	4226280	How dare you?
4226280	4228280	Athernity
4228600	4231880	What are you doing? I'm curious. What are your thoughts on this return to the office?
4234440	4236440	So office real estate
4237000	4239400	Um is a very competitive market
4240040	4245640	But if there's no value in an office, there can't be astronomical rental prices
4247000	4249000	Wait, you mean the whole
4249640	4256440	Market is rigged even for offices as well because people would just say well if offices aren't needed anymore
4256680	4258680	Why not turn them into more homes?
4260040	4264120	Oh, wait a minute, but that would lower the demand
4265160	4269160	Uh the artificial inflated demand by the way, um
4269800	4274120	And this all come back to office people got a lick of freedom
4274440	4280520	Um people got a lick of freedom of what it's like to be able to have a decent work balance type thing
4280840	4282920	And when you give people too much freedom
4283400	4289240	Uh, they might just get cheeky and revolt and the last thing we want is a cheeky revolt. Um
4290680	4293080	So if everyone's topic of conversation is
4294040	4302200	We have to go back to work. That's the people distracted on this conversation for a while 91. I'm jealous. I'm not there yet
4302520	4304520	Well, scum ass
4304680	4307400	Proposterous, thank you for the 10 of 30. Um
4308120	4312600	But yes, if all if imagine right now that every office building
4312920	4318280	Um that you can think of is lying empty and dormant right now
4319160	4323400	Because everyone can work from home do it take now. Obviously, that's not how all offices work
4323800	4330920	But think of the real estate. I would you could probably argue office space may be even outweighs what uh
4331640	4336040	A living space like no, well, probably not like not actually but you know what I mean
4337080	4340520	Um, I think you need to log in and out to update the horrors
4341160	4343160	The high score. Oh, sorry
4343160	4345480	I read that's horoscope for some reason. I might want you to use that to
4346120	4348120	In doing the horoscope
4349160	4354520	Uh, god forbid the peasants revolting as elites can't cycle money between yourself. Well, wasn't there a recent?
4355160	4357160	post that proved that um
4357560	4364200	The stock market the only way you can make money in the stock market is by doing daily trading type thing
4364440	4366840	Because everything is rigged already
4367400	4374840	Like I'm sorry. I've never trusted the stock market. I don't I look you can be a dumb woman doesn't know what she's talking about
4375000	4377480	Absolutely. Dumb woman does not know what she's talking about
4378280	4382360	Something about the stock market concept does not sit right with me
4382760	4384760	Like it just
4384920	4391720	I can't make heads. I just something is not right call me bricks and mortar because like at least something
4391720	4393640	It's physical and attainable
4393640	4396840	Sun does not sit right with me with the stock market especially
4397320	4402920	After the what was it game stock shenanigans the people basically went
4404280	4408280	We see you hedge funds. How about we counteract this and then they locked it down
4408680	4411640	So wait a minute. We're not allowed to do free trading
4412520	4415800	The people are not allowed to participate in the trading
4416120	4421320	Like sorry if that's not evidence enough or doesn't at least have your spider senses going off
4421640	4423800	Like i'm sorry you're just asking for it
4423880	4428840	Like I understand like I think the 401k for americans is actually in the stock market
4429320	4434920	Um instead of like a pension pot. Now, don't get me wrong. Australia, uk all participate in that pension pot
4435000	4440440	Fucking scamas. Then you get me wrong any private pension fund again. Oh scamas. Then you get me wrong
4440520	4442280	I get it the world is rigged
4442280	4448600	But like saws there's no free trade if congress is losing money 401k is a scam stocks is just legal gamble
4449080	4451080	Like i'm not being funny
4451480	4453480	um
4453480	4459320	When that game stop like let's go against the hedge funders like oh, this is abuse of the stock market
4459400	4461400	No, it's not it's the people
4461480	4467640	Um having a choice and the the choice was removed. So does that mean everything else is a scamas?
4468200	4475400	Most likely. I mean, I just can't trust it. I I can I can't I can't go after everything I witnessed during that
4475480	4478040	Little funny tee he let's go against the hedge funders
4478520	4479960	uh
4479960	4481080	like
4481080	4485640	You can't eat it like they blocked anyone from signing up you couldn't invest in it
4485880	4492360	So it had they forced it to crash again. They forced it to crash like no, it's not even tin foil
4492440	4494440	It's documented in real time
4495240	4497480	Like the the evidence is there
4499880	4504280	I'm sorry. It's not even tin foil. Sorry. I can't put a tin foil hat on that one
4504760	4512120	There's something. No, right. There's something fishy. I get on my cuttlefish, but that smells no coming from me because something smells fishy
4513000	4515000	And it's no this
4515320	4518680	No, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's evidence
4518680	4523400	And I'll wait until stormy hears about how the us can take away our freedom of speech during wartime
4523640	4526520	Oh, don't even get me started on like wars and all that stuff
4528200	4530840	Don't even get me that eat
4531720	4534760	How unbelievably sad wars are
4535960	4536920	um
4536920	4539720	What after what did they call it it's sheep leading lion
4540520	4545560	And I feel so sorry for like anyone that's even been roped into the like army and all that
4545720	4548680	Oh, that's another thing on population control
4549320	4551320	as well, um
4552680	4559320	You know who uh army sign-up rates of their lowest they've been because everyone is like so educated now
4559560	4562120	Who the fuck wants to die for the capitalist cog?
4562360	4563480	Ne one
4563480	4568680	Absolutely, ne one. So ne wonder your how your recruitment rates for the army are as low as piss
4569160	4572200	But when you make people desperate enough for money
4572840	4579960	Um i.e. getting them born into poverty cycle getting them like down on their luck like having to tolerate all these like
4580120	4584840	Crappy jobs having to pay these bills that are extortionate and aren't officially inflated and all that
4585640	4591720	Uh, yeah, you're probably gonna get a few more army sign-ups because people are literally like homeless type shit
4592120	4597800	They don't have a choice type shit, you know and how unbelievably profitable it is. Oh my god
4598040	4600040	Like it's just
4601640	4606360	Oh, that's good enough bread to migrate to australia to join your farm eventually

4659160	4661160	Broly legend
4663400	4664840	I did it
4664840	4669080	Not my rant making your hour of work super easy to get by that's hilarious
4669640	4672280	I'm glad that my little rants can do so
4672760	4677880	Right, maybe I should focus on cute v-tubers instead of the revolution that i'm secretly planning behind the scenes
4678120	4680840	What's that? You thought the siren wanted to drown you? No
4681720	4683720	I wanted to make you
4684040	4685640	influenced
4685640	4691320	And then we revolt. No, we don't revolt. We just make a little farm and live a good life. Sorry. It's it's
4691960	4695080	I don't want to stress you out any more than you have to be a little reefling
4695400	4698840	So let's let's just have a nice little farm together
4699480	4702040	We have a beautiful horse that we can enjoy
4703320	4704600	We have
4704600	4711880	Food the food is stocked in the pantry. We have all my freeze-dried fruit that last 20 years in case the collapse of society occurs
4712760	4714760	We have our little bug out bags
4715480	4717000	um
4717000	4722360	And during the day we go harvest and chop down trees so we can keep the heating on
4723880	4725640	And uh, yeah
4725640	4731320	Let loose the dogs of war. I'm ready my siren queen. Oh, yes. Yes, of course the farm. Yes. Yes
4731960	4733960	like yes
4734040	4739960	Valor is a company of peace the rev one message the revolution begins here the next message
4740680	4743960	We are reefling valor is a company of peace. Yes
4744920	4747480	The revolution section will not be live stream. No
4748280	4750280	It will not the revolution
4750760	4752920	It started all because I wasn't allowed to
4753720	4755160	clap my
4755160	4757560	Do clapping ASMR without my hands
4758360	4759560	Smile
4759560	4762360	That's that was the final straw that broke the camel's back
4763320	4765320	Making a little farm under
4765880	4769480	Capitalism is considered insurgents, but don't worry. We already have to fight for the cause
4770040	4772520	Do you guys did you guys ever read pig farm?
4773720	4775240	um
4775240	4777240	It was about how
4777880	4780440	It's really like it's really depressing and dystopian
4780600	4785640	But it was about how the people like seized the means of productions and worked for themselves and it was bliss
4786040	4789960	Now say it again for the people in the back strong. Oh
4790680	4793160	Bless the shimei. Thank you for the 20
4793640	4798120	Look, I'm only allowed to go on a little tinfoil rant for like maybe five minutes at a time
4798120	4800120	And then I'm not allowed to do it any further
4800440	4801800	um
4801800	4804600	But okay, so animal farm long and short
4805160	4810280	Instead of that. It's very fantasy based. So instead or well fantasy based
4811160	4816280	The animals on the farm revolt against the farmer and then they run the farm
4816600	4818600	But lo and behold
4818840	4825480	Someone cannot help themselves to just start making ranks and be a higher level and get special treatment and
4826120	4827320	um
4827320	4829720	The end of the book basically goes
4830280	4832280	um, the higher animals
4832440	4835720	um, we're no different than the men that once
4836280	4838280	um, like uh
4839160	4845720	You know ruled them as like a thingy. It just it's so depressing, but I love depressing endings. I'm sorry
4846040	4850840	1984 had my head like I was in a vice reading that book
4850920	4855480	I could not get away spoilers mate. The book's been out for how long
4856440	4863560	Is is big george orwell still with us? No, I don't even think orwell is still breathing unfortunately because he
4864440	4866440	is an old man
4867400	4869400	Is orwell still breathing?
4869720	4877480	Yeah, 1984 had me in a vice grip orwell has passed. Yes, I do believe the gentleman has passed um
4879080	4881080	and like
4882360	4885000	It's just crazy the comparisons
4885400	4892600	Especially actually, you know what one of the biggest hints should be if any book gets subdued publicly at any point in any country
4892920	4897720	Especially any book that gets subdued in like russia for example china for example
4898200	4900200	Pay extra heat to that book
4900840	4902840	1984 was banned in certain countries
4903240	4909320	Um, and if you read it, it is mortifying. Um when you start connecting some of the dots now. Don't get me wrong
4911160	4912760	It's just a book
4912760	4914360	But at the same time
4914360	4918280	Reflings at the same time as I make my countless wines
4920280	4923640	It is more than just a book. What's your favorite dystopian novel?
4923640	4928040	Oh, I think I'm gonna have to be basic and say 1984 like I was
4928600	4934920	Hooked on that book when I started it. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I did read fahrenheit
4935640	4942120	I enjoyed it. I fahrenheit. I get it. I'm I believe in it. I do get I do get um
4943240	4945240	Stay away
4946360	4947560	Uh
4947560	4951000	I have to say 1984 was a warning news as the blueprint
4951320	4955480	Yes, like I don't want to get too crazy on you. It's like I know I'm a wee bit crazy
4955640	4960360	But I didn't want to get too crazy. Like I you know, I'm still memeing away on ASMR and that like then I get too
4960520	4962680	Don't get scared to me. I promise. I'm not gonna uh
4963720	4966200	You know hypnotize you so we take down black rock
4967640	4969240	um
4969240	4975640	But yes, uh 1984 was published in 1949 an animal form with 1945. Yes, it's quite
4976280	4978840	scary the contrast
4979400	4984680	Uh that or the um similarities that you can pull from a book
4985480	4986440	from
4986440	4989800	X many years ago. Um and then
4990840	4992120	you know
4992120	4994120	You know, you know, you know
4994680	4996680	It's stroney getting crazy as hot though
4997960	5004600	Stroney, have you read pendulum? I have not read full cults pendulum. I don't have time to read books
5004680	5010120	I'm trying to get through the handmaiden's tale because I see it referenced everywhere and I'm like, what's this book even about?
5010520	5018600	I've only got a few chapters in but I don't have time to read books. It's so annoying unless like we play an audio book together
5018920	5020920	whilst I do rinse game
5021160	5027320	Leveling up in a past life. I was so close to buy a farm in honor of some radishes
5027960	5032520	Unfortunately, I lost my bid but I'm still aiming for the dream wait for really
5032520	5037560	We're gonna get a farm or you need to make sure it's not too unmanageable though farms can get a hand quick
5037800	5039800	Pentium. Thank you for the tip
5040760	5044520	Frickin stroney me to chat. I mean sometimes are you allowed to do that?
5045560	5046280	um
5046280	5051560	Who would have thought the anti capitals revolution would be led by an anime girl literally
5052200	5056440	I'm uh, uh, definitely need to give needy streamer
5057400	5060440	I watched the god ending on needy streamer
5060440	5065480	But she was like we need to take down 10 percent of the population wrong. We need to take down
5067080	5069800	Unless that 10 percent of the population
5070680	5075800	No, there's no way it's 10 percent. It's like 0.1 percent that pulls all the strings
5076600	5077880	Must be
5077880	5082760	It cannot be it cannot be that higher percentage of 10 percent. All right and needy streamer
5082840	5087880	She was like, yeah, let's just call 10 percent of the population is like, oh sit down there. I'm not sure I can get behind that one
5088280	5091880	Uh 10 percent would take out a lot percent anything
5092360	5094360	wink wink
5095000	5098520	It's 1 percent. It's the one but is it really that high? I don't think
5099320	5105960	For those who pull the strings. I feel like one percent is so high and in an eight billion population
5107320	5109320	Or do you mean it's the one percent?
5110040	5113000	Ah, okay. Okay. I understand. Sorry. Uh, yes
5114200	5116040	you know
5116040	5122680	See if she came out with that rhetoric, I would be giggling in my seat. No, I do not actually believe we should be
5124040	5125240	Um
5125240	5134120	Tally whacking people at will. No, that's absolutely not what I'm saying. Relax reeflings. We're not that serious about it
5134520	5141320	It's just um, it's a very how do you treat the symptoms of a disease that does not want to be cured and will do everything
5141720	5147240	And it's will not to be cured and actually does everything in its will to get sicker and sicker
5147640	5151080	and that's why 1984 was actually so, um
5151880	5156440	Shawnee making wines with the grapes of wrath honestly, um
5156440	5157560	Um
5157560	5159560	Shawnee if you stop at pull the strings
5159640	5163160	It just goes to their friend who are willing to take over got cleared the entire
5163640	5169480	Hedge growth not a branch. Oh steady. You can't be talking to me like that reefling. You'll turn me on
5170760	5172760	Stop um
5173560	5180120	Yes, what do you do about a patient that wants to get sicker and sicker and lets themselves get sicker and sicker
5180760	5183320	The thing about 1984
5184120	5185240	was
5185240	5187240	the people
5187320	5189320	outnumber
5189560	5193880	The bigger uppers if you will buy an extortionate amount
5194360	5199960	And the book basically was like the uprise is coming the uprise is coming the uprise is coming
5200680	5206360	But the uprise never came because they dealt with it as problems occurred
5206920	5211400	Obviously now that was very think police stop police. There is a game called we happy few
5211960	5215160	I feel like if I ever booted up the game we happy few
5215240	5221480	I would need to shove that tinfoil hat on before the stream even started because I don't know what to expect from it
5221720	5223720	But from what of herge
5224040	5225400	it is
5225400	5227400	kind of like that
5228600	5231800	Gotta get all the heads off of hydra. I wish all the string pullers are very
5232520	5234520	Adri chrome shortage
5235080	5237080	Adrena chrome source
5237160	5239880	I don't even know what that one is instant heart attack
5240440	5244200	Like if the death note was like a thing honestly
5246280	5249960	Honestly, I wonder like just oh no, they had a heart attack because they're old. Oh no
5251960	5253960	We Flynn you can't say that
5255880	5260440	She lacks critical information. I actually do for once we well always let's be honest
5260680	5267240	We have few gameplay mids, but the story is so the gameplay is bad, but the story is good curious
5267960	5274040	Curious, we might give it a shot. How what does if you type in we happy few how long play time?
5274040	5276040	What does it say? How many hours does it say?
5276840	5282680	Stroney, have you heard the oracle of dead delphi? I have not I have not I apologize sad
5282680	5287240	We had so we happy few so buggy. It had such a good premise though
5288120	5294840	Actually, I might play a ridiculous game with you. It's an orwell game or well inspired game
5294920	5298040	It's a tech space game. I might get mercy on it if I'm allowed
5298520	5300920	Because I know she likes kind of clicker games that don't
5301400	5305720	Because of our emotion sickness and all that. I might get merch you to play out and be a
5313320	5315320	Are you squiddling me right now?
5315720	5322440	Love your ranch stroney. They're so fun. They are so isn't it adorable when anime girls get heated about capitalism
5323160	5325880	Thank you so much for the tip a glitter
5326760	5330440	Shit a pot, but we're 80. We're 80

5334920	5341160	That's fun. We can cook sharks if I so desired level 80
5342520	5347320	There's an orwell game called orwell. Oh, that's the name of the game. You're right. That is the name of the game
5347480	5349960	You can cook burn sharks. Yeah, I'm not gonna burn the sharks
5350200	5354040	How long are you streaming today? It's not that long today. Um

5566520	5567560	Ah
5567560	5572360	But it's still not resolved, but we know what the problem is at least or I think
5573160	5575160	I think maybe I might be resolved soon again
5576440	5582600	But it means um her streams will no longer cut off in the middle of the stream where she disappears for a couple of minutes
5582600	5585720	Once she fixes the problem thank yad
5586600	5590120	Um, I don't want to embarrass her by saying what the problem was
5591240	5593240	But dear lord Azura

5746520	5752280	And then I can do my little hand cam stream. Well, it's just gonna have to be tiny and down there. I know you can't read it. Um
5753800	5756840	I might edit that so it just says merch
5758840	5762520	Oh my god, I can see it. Yeah, because that make it massive in the middle of the screen

5818200	5824440	Yeah, no, we can't sacrifice 100% high octane high quality. Captivating gameplay exactly
5824840	5828920	Next level you can cook turtles. I don't think I want to cook a turtle. That's not very nice

6125880	6129080	Like I'm not being funny whenever chinese auntie clocks me
6129240	6133000	She always like fills up the food extra and gives me like extra things away
6136040	6138040	With friends like these
6139000	6144040	Squishy that uh that you do it's because you treat people like humans
6145000	6152520	God we are absolutely waning it up in this place. She's slow. Oh shit. How did you even tail all that?
6153400	6156600	You've paired. Oh my god. You put it in. Anyone got a spear jar going?
6159080	6160120	Um
6160120	6162120	chinese auntie fill it up mommy. Oh
6163000	6167880	It's literally she feeds me so much and she gives me a discount and she gives me extra food
6168360	6170360	Like just to look after me
6171000	6174040	And I'm like, bro. I'm sorry, but everyone's like so lovely
6176120	6177000	Um
6177000	6183320	Everyone's so lovely in australia. I've never had one bad interaction. Actually, I tell you I had one bad interaction in australia
6183880	6189400	Tell jeff over there. Hey, um, I'm sure it was just like a long bad day. Um
6190120	6194360	But um in the uk when you use your card
6194600	6196600	It does not ask for a prompt
6197160	6201160	To take it from your savings account a debit account or something like that
6201400	6204040	For some reason when you use a card in australia
6204360	6209560	It gives a prompt and it's like take the money out of these three areas and I'm like, but it's a debit card
6209560	6211560	It can only come out of one area
6211960	6217800	And and basically I was holding up the till and um, I asked her I was like, I'm so sorry
6217880	6223320	But what does this mean like, um, this is just a debit account the money's in the account what one day I hit
6223880	6228040	Um, and like she did explain it to me with like a big huff and a size type thing
6228600	6231240	Um, and I was just like, I'm really sorry, but in scotland
6231240	6235480	We don't have anything like that. You just use your card and then she like can't not pass
6235720	6241640	I guess it was passive aggressively. She was like, well, you're no in scotland anymore. Are you and I was like, oh, okay, um
6242520	6247720	But I'm sure it was just a bad day and she was overworked like give people the benefit of the doubt empathy
6247880	6251400	Get be empathetic. Exactly. Oh my god. I wanted to do an empathy stream
6251880	6257320	Empathy this is a perfect example. Someone made a snarky remark towards me
6257560	6263000	How can we be empathetic to someone that may have said something that was a bit of a negative experience?
6263480	6269480	To show empathy we think to ourselves. Well, this person's working odds are minimum wage. They're exhausted
6269800	6275160	They most likely have a family issues going on behind the scenes. They've probably not been well rested
6275560	6279160	Um, so their filter to be polite had gone for that moment
6279240	6285320	If only for a moment we give someone the benefit of the doubt and we practice empathy. Whoa, just like that
6286280	6288040	Cut their brake tyres
6288040	6295320	Steady on maybe that's not rather empathetic of you, but we will try our best to be more empathetic to situations like this
6295880	6297560	um
6297560	6299160	Shout out to chinese aunties
6299160	6304280	There's this old chinese woman that owns her shop down the road and work and she brings me free stuff whenever I have a bad day
6304680	6311480	Literally chinese aunties look after you so selflessly and she works so hard. Like I absolutely adore my auntie. Um
6313000	6318280	Like we're on a first name basis and everything and I don't know when our birthday is and all that but I should maybe ask
6318440	6320440	I can get her something nice
6321000	6327800	Talking about that if you ever go to a convention in real life, would you be comfortable hugging the refunds? Oh my god? Yeah
6328440	6331320	I'm sorry. I don't know why people would be
6331640	6336840	Uncomfortable. I mean, I guess I'm just maybe I'm naive. Let me be naive. I'm sorry, but
6337800	6339960	Let me be naive. Let me enjoy
6340840	6346040	Reflings at a convention. Let me hump them. That's all I'm saying. I'll have security. I'll handle
6346120	6351160	I'll hire the security guard. So if things get out of hand, I'll be like no, no, but I'm gonna be honest
6351640	6354840	Um, I did get a bit of feedback where folk were like I'd be too
6355080	6359720	I'd be too scared to like look her in the eyes if you're too scared to look me in the eyes
6360120	6365480	I feel like my voice is going to be like a thum in Skyrim and if I say it right back off
6365960	6370680	Like everyone's gonna be like whoo because you're not used to me being like
6371560	6376280	Like expressing negative emotions that you need to back off right now. I'm being serious
6376360	6378680	Like I feel like everyone would be like, oh
6379560	6381560	Did anyone a deal with strong a like that?
6382520	6384120	um
6384120	6389560	I heard all of them. Well, I don't know what convention we could possibly go to but um
6390360	6394200	I contact a little bit of naïve. He goes a long way. Oh my girl
6394360	6398920	Well, all of my girlfriends have been long distance, which means I've always been at risk of organ traffic
6399560	6401960	Stereo and let's like keep our organs intact
6402600	6408680	As much as living with one kidney is possible. It does put down your function down a little bit. Oh, sorry
6410360	6411720	Um
6411720	6414760	Yes yell at me more sexy squash woman
6415720	6420680	I don't even know about being scared but physical contact with a bunch of strangers seems like an easy way it gets like
6420920	6424760	I mean I'd have hand sanitizer with me as long as no one's like
6425640	6431720	I bet you someone would take it a contest being like this streamer hates the reeflings because she has hand sanitizer
6431720	6434040	It's like no motherfucker. I want to stream when I get back home
6435000	6437000	I want to stream
6438280	6440280	I don't want to be sick
6440520	6444680	So I need to use hand sanitizer whilst we're all touching each other not like that
6445560	6449880	When we hold hands and stuff and like do high fives and hugs or whatever
6450440	6456440	Oh my god, should for like the severely tism should I get a little chart for you so you can point on the chart?
6456440	6458360	What interaction you want from me?
6458360	6460360	So the first one's like a high five
6460760	6466360	The second one is hold your hand. The third one is a hug and then the fourth one is me sitting on you
6467000	6470280	Should I do that? So for those of you who struggle to speak
6471080	6474600	To whammy don't worry. I got you covered. I'm one of the bros for one and two
6474680	6479400	I've got a little pictorial chart so you just point to what interaction you want nice and simple
6479400	6483560	See you don't even have to talk if you're too shy that you can't get words out or you have a starter
6483800	6485800	I got you covered man
6486680	6489000	Oh, it'd be a big poster board for what we're wanting
6489960	6493880	I'd bring a sign saying strongy. Please great me bruv. I think they'd take that sign off you
6494040	6496840	I'm pretty sure conventions take signs off of people
6497640	6504600	Um, which I didn't know about they also take away like fake weaponry if it doesn't have the orange tip on the weapon
6505400	6506600	um
6506600	6509240	Yeah points at high five and nods like oh, yeah

6539160	6543800	You didn't have to worry about me me. Uh, should you I'm as brain dead as you are if anything
6543800	6548360	I'm actually more brain dead. You're smarter than me. So you really shouldn't have to be worried
6549400	6550600	Uh
6550600	6554120	If I met you in real life, I'd go feel scott's and only you'd understand might probably
6554760	6558440	No, the refland you guys have been learning my scottish accent very well
6559560	6561560	You guys have been getting used to
6561640	6563560	um
6563560	6569880	Like I was eating my burger and someone pointed out I said canny passively like I've I don't know if you've noticed
6569960	6574120	I've slowly been slipping into using a tiny bit more scottish slang
6574920	6580200	Just because uh, you guys are getting used to it. So I don't really feel forced to like
6582120	6583160	I don't know
6583160	6589160	Annunciate my words more like I've been a bit more mumbly in recent streams because that's kind of where I naturally lie
6589720	6591720	um
6591800	6595080	Line-up reflings mean to help mommy with her squats, honestly
6595640	6601960	I'm fairly expecting my boss to ask me. What is what's for that scottish accent a refling message with that?
6602040	6603480	They were like
6603480	6605720	They were working and they spoke at their work
6606360	6608360	um, and uh
6608920	6610440	basically
6610440	6611800	um
6611800	6613800	Long story short
6614120	6618360	Uh, they've been developing an accent because they've been like mimicking because you mimic what you hear
6618440	6622280	It's very natural to mimic what you hear. It's completely natural. Don't ever be embarrassed
6622840	6624360	and
6624360	6626840	Passport bros like that. What's a passport bro?
6627640	6630920	Like that accent passport bros like that accent
6631480	6635160	I'm so sorry. I don't know what that terminology is. Are you teaching me something new refling?
6636040	6638040	A passport bro
6639800	6643640	I've been using me haps unironically. Yes, it's happening
6644760	6646120	me haps
6646120	6650600	Would you kindly a passport bro is a person that marries women from overseas?
6651320	6655160	A passport was when you move to a foreign country and find a more traditional way
6655240	6659080	She doesn't know a passport bro passport where men who look for women overseas. Oh
6661400	6668680	Like 90 day fiance as a retail worker one of my most memorable moments was when some lady apologized for her friends
6669000	6672440	Ridiculously insulting attitude when she didn't like my answer
6672920	6678520	Thank you to anyone with even a minuscule amount of empathy. Oh, I know I'm a miss. Thank you for the tip
6678600	6680840	I'm sorry. You had to experience that bra
6681400	6686520	I'm literally always on the side of like the fucking retail worker. I'm
6688200	6694520	Maybe because you know I worked as a waitress. Um, but like it's freaking terrible like with some of the stuff you have to go through
6695560	6698760	I am very lucky. I was in a tourist cafe
6699320	6704520	Which meant I had a lot of um people who were you know, having a good time. Um,
6705320	6711320	Didn't really have any issues. I was just looking for the authentic like Scottish experience type thing
6711560	6715720	With the the food on the menu and that so there really was no issues. Um
6716760	6721320	I actually can hardly think of one really bad experience. I had
6721880	6728760	Essentially an American Karen, but it honestly wasn't that bad. So in American table culture
6729480	6730760	the
6730760	6732760	waitresses I believe
6733720	6738840	Make money via tips so they want to serve as much tables as possible to make as much tips as possible
6739320	6746120	So I think once you're finished eating they give you the bill and spank your butt and out you go in the UK
6746840	6751480	um, if you're a patron, um, it is very common just to sit and enjoy
6752040	6758280	Your lovely jubbly meal. Um, you can sit and digest for a little bit and continue the conversation with your party members
6758680	6762280	Um, unfortunately, we did have a an American family come in
6763240	6770600	peak peak tourist season, uh, no reservation had uh walked on by and came on in and
6771320	6776200	We very we I say we because um, I had to get boss man in on it
6776440	6781640	We very politely had to explain bro. We are fully booked. Uh, we have tables out the wazoo
6782200	6789800	Um, if you just take a left down the street, you will find tons of cafes that have much bigger capacity type thing
6790360	6794920	Um, I'd love to debate strongy. Good because I'd like to master debate you. Thank you. Thank you
6798120	6800600	Yes, um and
6801720	6803240	basically
6803240	6805640	She in front of guests
6806600	6812120	It's pointed at them pointed at guests at table and said their plates are empty. We want a seat there
6812920	6814920	And I was like, oh
6814920	6821720	This is a culture clash because one that's highly inappropriate and two that is highly inappropriate and three that's highly inappropriate
6822120	6827880	Um, and basically obviously we're like, yeah, we don't have capacity like off your pop
6827880	6833080	And um, and she went somewhere else that was like for in terms of Karen's story. Yeah
6833080	6835320	I really ain't that bad. I really ain't that bad
6836760	6840760	This is why I'm going to be late for work tomorrow despite working from home
6842040	6845240	Wait, do you need to go to sleep? If anyone needs to go to sleep, please rest well
6845320	6851000	I believe she be and eme are about to go live eme is doing a wonderful wonderful collab with someone
6851160	6857640	Unfortunately, I forgot the name on please apologies. Um, and she be is going live with inscription
6858120	6860120	Um, a little card based her base
6861080	6863080	Thinking my barber
6864440	6872200	There was that fort folk out. I want to eat it was very like, oh, this is definitely a culture clash because that is like you cannot do that
6872760	6873640	and
6873640	6879720	You cannot be pointing around at people's empty plates demanding that we kick them out in quotation marks
6879720	6884680	So you can get a seat. Yeah, I don't want like that. She be has delayed until a later time
6885160	6887160	That is not my time zone. So that is
6887800	6892840	Emme isn't live for another two hours. She be is delayed. Okay. There are harem
6893400	6900200	Harem on standby harem. Don't worry. You don't have to be on copium for long. It's one hour. She's asking for one hour. Okay
6901480	6908280	Once she be goes live, I'll take a break question mark and I'll go get a tea question mark and some snacks question mark
6908840	6910840	um
6911240	6915560	Yeah, that sounds rude doing that is the fastest way to get thrown out of an establishment in the cobs called
6915960	6922040	Thankfully, I have never ever been in a situation where like police had to get involved
6922440	6924440	um, the weirdest situation
6925320	6927320	Doing a tango or having a square
6928040	6931480	the weirdest situation ever was
6932280	6933240	um
6933240	6933960	so
6933960	6937400	um a member of staff overheard this table
6938200	6941960	Talking to amongst themselves that they were going to skip on paying the bill
6942440	6946360	Like they were going to do a runner. I think it's called dine and dash as the terminology
6946920	6951560	Doesn't listen to her huff that copium. It's going to be a one hour. You can hold on for one hour
6952440	6955560	Or here. I'm sorry. You can hold on for one hour here
6956440	6959480	You've held on for longer for she be okay. Um
6960520	6966760	Uh, basically overheard someone do a dine and dash. So then someone had to fucking guard the door
6967560	6972360	Um in order to prevent them from doing that and paying and they looked so sheepish
6972840	6975400	Like when they were paying they looked so scared
6975720	6981320	So I think they genuinely were going to do it. They were just idiots and said the crime part out loud for some reason
6982600	6984600	Whoa that voice
6985640	6991880	Uh, yeah, don't don't ever say your crime out loud for some reason. I don't know why people think that's okay
6997480	6999480	Um
7001800	7006920	Yes, sorry, I got just I'm I'm reading the replies on my my little mean uh
7007640	7010520	My little mean post on twitter and I'm giggling away on my head
7011880	7014440	I am I'm so funny. I'm so humorous sometimes
7015960	7022600	Boss mom stroney prepares everyone for the girls looks like mommy you should play bread and fred for a collab. What the heck is bread and fred?
7023880	7026440	Unless your name's fred. I ain't getting bread in this scenario

7126120	7132200	I go so freaking shy. I was so annoyed. Literally. I remember looking over the
7133080	7136760	I actually recorded it in obs which was dangerous. I shouldn't have but I did anyway
7137560	7142920	Um, and I remember looking at the timer and it was like two minutes and 11 seconds and I was like
7144280	7150120	Bro the allegations that I'm a quick shot. This is getting a bit too much now. Um
7152600	7156440	I was like, oh, right. Okay. I'll keep going but then ended up getting shy
7156520	7161720	Which artificially extended the time feels good, man. So now I did a normal amount
7164520	7166520	I'm so normal I'm a normal
7167320	7169320	There are no allegations
7170280	7172280	But what about the noises
7172680	7177960	In the background. Oh, no, that's my chair. I did it in my chair. This one right here that I'm sitting in right now
7179720	7183320	That's what all the squeaking and all that was because I had both my legs up on the desk

7207640	7210440	Is there proof on the chair? No, there's not proof on the chair
7212840	7214840	Uh
7215080	7218360	Although possibly there could have been now that I think about
7219320	7224680	But never use the pc that someone lives on at least not in keyboard and mouse
7224680	7227640	Yeah, you do not want to be touching anything of mine

7423000	7425880	Yep, eighties what it is
7428280	7433560	What's the model of your keyboard? I'm so sorry. It just says corsair. I don't actually know what it is
7433960	7438360	It might be the Australian version. I didn't know that
7439080	7445560	British keyboards and Australian keyboards are different because there's a key binding that's in a different place or location
7446120	7448920	And I'm like, why why is it not universal?
7449560	7456760	So I might have an Australian corsair keyboard. Um, it lights up. That's all I know. I'm trying to look for a label on it
7457000	7460360	Oh, wait, I can turn it over. Hold on. I'm turning my keyboard over right now
7461080	7463880	Uh, hold on. I want to make sure I don't accidentally
7464520	7467720	De-wine myself, which is not what we're wanting to do
7468360	7471640	Hold on the keyboard has been turned over. I'm looking at spare bottom
7472520	7474520	the keyboard says
7477720	7484840	Corsair k70 rgb mk2 mechanical gaming keyboard. Is that what you wanted? Did I do it right?
7485240	7489080	That's surely what you wanted, right? That's surely what you needed the information you seek
7490360	7492360	Well
7492360	7495960	Uh, it does have a uk. Wait, is this a british keyboard or not?
7497720	7500280	Identify yourself. Are you a british keyboard? Did I bring you?
7501160	7502360	You british
7502360	7504360	It says uk in canada
7504840	7508520	It says uk and c8. Okay. I think this is a british version of the corsair
7509880	7511880	Corsair is shit
7513240	7515560	Okay, what do you want me to cry about it?
7516520	7521800	What was that? How is it bad? Am I being pepega? Why is it bad? It does what I need it to do
7522840	7524840	You don't know you just don't like it
7525560	7527800	Oh, did a mod tickle your message?
7528920	7530920	Get right
7530920	7532360	Get right
7532360	7534360	You can tell it's british if the keys are cr-
7536360	7538360	A riflin
7539880	7542760	Riflin that's too funny. I can't even laugh at that
7543000	7545000	I
7545320	7547320	Riflin
7548360	7550360	That's terrible
7553080	7558040	Now you're fine. Well, I was the me that did it. I was the me that did that didn't mean I didn't remove your message
7558840	7565320	The british teeth humor and sham will stop because I've got messed up teeth. The allegations aren't looking good for me
7567160	7570840	I can't believe it. I can't believe I wasn't sponding with veneers attached
7571320	7574360	Um, oh, we should do the veneer ramble one day
7577080	7582040	When I say we should do the veneer rant one day, do I mean should I do it right now?
7583240	7585880	What happens if we go on the root canal rant? Oh
7587480	7591160	But wait, but I'm british so I'm not sure I can start on anyone's teeth to be honest
7591720	7597640	I'm british you have no mercy. My favorite one is the fish
7598360	7603960	It's like a fish and it goes well at least our schools and then that's the meme. It just cuts off
7603960	7610120	There's nothing else to the meme. It's just like a fish. We're really messed up teeth and it goes well at least our schools
7611400	7617000	Um, I wonder if I can find it and put it on the screen. Oh, I don't think I have enough time to
7617720	7620520	Do my way. Oh god. I've already had a root canal
7621160	7623160	Oh
7623320	7629400	So root canal is has a very high success rate of failing
7629880	7633160	And if your tooth is at the point root canal is advised
7633880	7637080	You're probably better just getting it removed to be honest
7637960	7639960	um
7641000	7649320	I think I didn't understand anything the peeler allegation. Oh my god, merci freaking joined in the peeler allegations

8752920	8756680	That these tv stars were coming over to record a movie or something
8757000	8761160	Whilst like the entire country was in shutdown. So it was like, aye rules for us, but no for you

8981720	8983160	What

8989240	8990520	um
8990520	8992840	I am not doing the uno collab
8993400	8994200	um
8994200	8999400	She be because um, so originally the club actually didn't even have me in it in the uno collab
8999800	9003640	Um, she be was originally going to be in it, but her work clashed with it
9003880	9008840	Um, so I stepped in um because it was supposed to be like kind of a we send off for em
9008920	9010920	Because she's about to go on holiday
9011720	9013720	on holiday
9013720	9015480	um
9015480	9020120	Because I wanted um, you know embers to feel our love unanimously. Um
9021720	9027480	So she be is stepping in I am not doing that uno club. So I'm changing the schedule
9027880	9031000	I do have a member's ASMR stream, but I'm going to change it
9031880	9033880	um
9034120	9036120	I am going to play
9036120	9037160	Baltro
9037160	9042760	I think we'll do two hours of Baltro and then two hours of member stream ASMR. Um
9044200	9050520	And then that four hour day will allow me to catch up on all my editing that I'm missing out upon
9051320	9057000	Um, because yes, she just quit her in real life drop. Not streaming. Oh, did I say it the wrong way around? Sorry
9057640	9059640	She be quit her in real life job
9060360	9062360	Not valour
9062440	9069080	Um, so she be is taking my spot in the uno club. So it is she be mersey emmy
9069880	9075720	And azura together having fun shenanigans. Um, so please do look forward to that
9076360	9080360	Um, I will be doing a member's
9081320	9083320	stream
9083400	9088760	Which will be redirect remembers ASMR. Oh, did I redirect a hundred of members ASMR?
9088760	9090760	Um
9090840	9095000	Decisions decisions. I think I will because I don't think anyone sleeps during my ASMR
9095000	9097000	Let's be honest. None of us are sleeping during it. Um
9097560	9103480	I will redirect into them and you guys can watch them. I will then go and catch up on all my editing
9104120	9105800	and
9105800	9109800	I'm really really excited for the ASMR stream. I don't even have anything planned for anything special
9110120	9115640	It always turns into the same thing where we're being really inappropriate with one another, but I don't mind it. I like it
9116440	9118440	um
9119240	9121240	Yeah
9121480	9127160	Very curious, very curious. Take care of the madness running. Actually your ASMR is the only ASMR that puts me out
9127960	9130680	Is it because my voice is so monotone naturally like
9131640	9135880	Yeah, you like it. You're like a monotone voice. Oh, you feel so sleepy, don't you?
9136920	9139800	And sometimes my accent makes me say a funny word
9140360	9146360	And it's rather humorous, but yet you can't stop listening because it slowly brings you down
9147240	9149240	And to ever lie
9151400	9157480	Your eyes riefling your eyes they feel so heavy heavy heavy eyes
9158840	9163880	But that's okay riefling. It's all gonna be okay. Just relax
9166440	9168440	No, I'm not gonna put you to sleep right now, but
9170360	9172040	That is
9172040	9175720	Yeah, like when you talk like that. Yeah tingle when you talk like that brain
9177240	9179800	I like when you go between soft spoken and whispering. Hmm
9181080	9183080	I I'm having a fun time
9183480	9189960	Collabbing with other creators because I put in the script. Please whisper and then they do soft spoken and I'm like, ah
9190760	9197000	Plus no cigar. I think I might need to make a little audio tutorial and be like, this is general talking
9197800	9199400	This is
9199400	9205320	Soft whispering because you can actually still hear me. It's soft spoken. Sorry soft spoken is when you can still hear that
9205880	9212200	And the voice okay, and then whispering is when you're actually whispering and there's no grip to your voice because there's not enough
9213080	9215080	voice
9215880	9217320	Um
9217320	9219560	Yeah, I've asked for people like please whisper through the script
9219720	9223800	So I've recorded my lane's whispering and they've done it soft spoken even though I asked for whisper
9223800	9225800	I'm like you goofy goober you
9226120	9228120	yard
9228200	9231880	The one thing I hated about the ASMR community is that people label stuff ASMR, but it's really audio
9231960	9233080	Don't
9233080	9234600	What do you mean?
9234600	9242760	What my ASMR streams have me laughing because I stuck a stick up my nose and completely break any ASMR aspect of it
9243320	9246280	What are we talking about? No
9248520	9252040	Yeah, it's me. It's me that abuses the ASMR tag
9253080	9256120	Sorry, I'll start naming my stuff not ASMR. Okay
9257080	9265160	Yeah, it's hilarious and cute. I sent a way to get clipped. I don't know if it's appropriate for if it will turn into a clip, but uh, yeah
9266360	9269240	At lol, I love the snores the ASMR snores
9270600	9272600	Peppa pig
9273560	9276840	No, no, no, that's not what meant. Oh, did I misunderstand? Sorry, my apologies
9277400	9282680	Most ASMRs put a lot of work into learning not to whisper because it's really bad for your vocal record me on the other hand
9282840	9284280	fuck them
9284280	9290920	Tear my vocal chords apart. I will do whatever makes you happy if my my whispering makes you happy
9292600	9294520	I will whisper
9294520	9296040	I was fighting millennia
9296040	9297880	Well, that was happening and it made me
9298600	9304760	It made the fight impossible you giggling away at yourself ASMR not ASMR essentially. Yes. That's how I'm going to start labeling it
9306040	9307720	ASMR is just
9307720	9313560	Shit wasn't time for scrawny honestly. I love a good ASMR meme. Sorry. I do I can't get away from it
9314440	9318040	I love it. I'm so like I completely understand don't get me wrong
9318040	9323560	I completely understand why that butt clapping video got taken down, but it was so fun
9324680	9328040	It was such a funny idea. You know what youtube
9328680	9329560	a
9329560	9335960	Five years ago or whatever four years ago three years ago. No, actually all this freaking breathing stuff is recent
9336760	9341160	YouTube three months ago with a he-hod at that and then all of a sudden there's been the stealth update
9341640	9343640	Breathing bad women breathing bad
9344280	9351160	Afternoon strongy house cooking. We're cooking by via fermentation of wine. Um, we are just
9352360	9354360	um
9354360	9359000	We're level 82. I did want to become level 85
9359880	9364840	The reeflings have completely stalked me out the wazoo for all the wine. I'm gonna actually need
9365160	9369080	I've got Gandalf over here. What's going on? Gandalf the yellow
9369800	9372600	Check it out. Oh, we got uh, no
9372760	9375080	Oh, you're pimped out in a different costume
9375960	9378120	I thought it was a new refund. You tricked me
9378920	9381160	You tricked me. You look mildly different than before
9382200	9384200	You must be a whole new person
9385880	9391000	At first I was a little disappointed at the meme ASMR, but whenever it's an ASMR is ASMR especially from strongy
9391320	9397240	Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't kind of like it. But I don't know. I just I just I like the non serious stuff, you know
9397720	9403640	Like literally I have an ear cleaning ASMR and it starts with me going the std clinic is two doors down
9404120	9409400	And then you come in and it's actually you're getting your ears cleaned like I'm sorry. I love a little tea heat
9409480	9415880	I love a little mischievousness a little bit of tomfoolery. I do I do. I love it. I can't help it
9417720	9421560	Stronger your one k ramble ASMR is now my go-to for sleep. I'm glad you liked it
9421880	9426680	That's what happens if I don't give myself a script. It just turns into an absolute mess
9427400	9429480	Um, absolute mess. Um
9431240	9434600	I just like start rantin about anything that comes into my head
9436120	9438120	Fuck you
9438120	9441240	No, I love all the ASMR's all of them. Oh feels good man
9442840	9446520	Rip the video, but it was worth it. It was worth it. At least the audio's on patreon
9446840	9448840	Um
9450520	9453080	Uh, but yes, that is me
9454440	9459960	That's me take I'll at me means, but I do actually have some serious ASMR is coming out. Oh, I can't believe it
9461880	9466760	I actually need to record tapping ASMR. We'll still have my my nails. Can you? Oh, yes
9467560	9474040	Oh, that's right. Tingle for me. Tingle for me, baby. Yeah, you're tingling all over aren't you? Yes
9474040	9476040	Um
9477000	9484200	I actually need to record tingle ASMR tapping ASMR because I have my nails done which produces a really nice tapping sound
9485160	9487960	a live ASMR would be profit for clippers though
9490360	9492360	I
9492440	9497000	I went through my clips not many people are like clipping on youtube, which is perfect to find
9497080	9500120	Please don't actually feel like you have to do it. But if you ever like watch
9500440	9505000	Um by like a like if you're watching a vod and you've found a funny moment
9505080	9511080	Like clip it because I can see it and then send it on to an editor. Hi we fling something smells fishy. It's me. I'm sorry
9512200	9514200	Oh, is it fire we fling over there?
9514840	9516600	Sorry
9516600	9522680	Um, I literally cannot find the clip button. I do is it is it even on mobile phones?
9524600	9527800	On your wee iphone or your wee samsung or your wee
9528360	9529480	uh
9529480	9531480	I've forgotten the name of the chinese brand phone
9532200	9534200	Clipping is a hassle live. Is it?
9535320	9541560	There used to be a bunch of live ASMR videos and then youtube called them all. Yeah, I'm not surprised. I don't know what's
9542120	9548200	There's definitely a stealth thing like everyone's getting hit. I saw this other creator got hit with an ASMR thing recently as well
9548200	9550440	And I'm like bruv. Sorry, but this is just too obvious
9551160	9553160	There's definitely been a stealth update
9553320	9555240	um
9555240	9558440	And they're going buck wild for it because yeah
9559480	9562520	Who are you? I think yeah, that seems like a who are you?
9563480	9565480	It is the scissors above chat
9565640	9568440	Scissors above chat the clip button is available on the phone
9570440	9572440	But yeah, um
9572520	9576440	But don't be shy if you're ever watching a vod and you're like, oh that was mildly humorous and pro
9576440	9582040	It could possibly be turned into a clip. Thank you. Please. Uh, let me who where what I can't say who I
9582680	9584680	who I
9584680	9587640	No fun allowed on youtube once again. I'll be surprised legit
9588280	9591800	It used to be the wild west and as time progresses it just goes less
9598920	9601560	Also little annoying thing about the button if you join a stream
9602440	9606680	Where you were there since the waiting and you won't have a clip on because it's dumb so refresh
9607320	9611880	My only complaint. Sorry. My voice is starting to die. I think I need to get hydration shortly
9612520	9619240	Um, my only complaint with clips is that you can't share them anonymously your count is tight. Yes. I'm almost say that's also not
9620040	9624520	A fun element in before I'm going to start noticing that the people are clipping
9624520	9630040	You're just called straw knees clipper straw knees clipper clipper of straw knee because you guys are making like side accounts to clip
9630600	9632600	That would be cute
9634200	9641080	So about the tingles them are gonna fuse kinst ones. Oh, yeah, you're gonna keep I cannot believe I defeated the boss
9641560	9644040	in Legend of Zelda the first time
9645000	9650600	I thought we were in for a rage fest like I ate my burger. I stuffed it down my throat
9651000	9657160	I had my my cola on standby had some cheesy chips because I was like we're in for the long haul
9657240	9664360	I suck at this and oh my gosh like the patience the timing like everything couldn't have gone better
9665080	9668440	That was amazing. I was so happy with the results of that
9669400	9676360	A certified gamer moment. Vati isn't that hard? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't say that part out loud. Hold on a minute
9677000	9682280	Yeah, I I defeated the boss in one try. That's what you say. You don't say that the other part there
9683320	9689480	Refling, let me place my fingers on your lips. Refling. Don't ever say that again out loud with such confidence
9689480	9693720	Do I make myself clear the boss is hard? I defeated the boss in one. Okay
9694360	9696360	I
9698120	9700120	Watched the voice
9700280	9707000	You did so well. Thank you so much. I adore that game. I really do. I have absolutely no idea where the missing hearts are
9708280	9716200	Um, I I thought I could 100% it but now that the fail is like in the corrupted state of like everything is terrible
9717560	9719560	Ah, yes Skyrim on legendary
9719960	9724680	Look, I got a skyrim achievements to work. So I hope you're getting ready for some gamerscore collect in in july
9725480	9731000	Um, I have a bit of a bit of news. So as you know, my dad is coming home. Um
9732040	9736360	So I think my streams are gonna I can't believe I'm saying this
9737240	9740440	I'm going to be doing uh in quotation marks
9741080	9743720	regular stream of four hours
9744120	9746120	Daily
9746440	9751960	I probably can't go more than four hours without interrupting my dad. Um
9753160	9761960	So I know it's shocking. It's truly it's regular stream. I can't it's mortifying news and all honesty
9762680	9764680	Um, I'll see what my
9765560	9769400	The situation when my dad is because he's wanting to like take me
9770200	9775640	To like the shops and like go in like father daughter date type stuff because I've no seen him in a bit. Um
9776840	9781160	Um, I'm getting I'm gonna take me to a petting zoo. I think
9782040	9787560	Uh praying there's like actually animals there or it's just going to be like a goat in a field with like one of those like
9787640	9790600	Put 50 cents in here and turn the style and feed the animal
9791240	9794760	Can your stream addiction handle the it's going to be really weird
9795480	9802600	Because like in the most respectful way like I'm just so used to like talking all day long to you reeflings
9803240	9808200	So the thought of being like, oh no, I'm actually time gated
9809400	9814120	Like I I don't experience time gated like yesterday. I thought I was only going to stream for four hours
9814120	9818120	It turned out to be nine because yeah, like I'm not time gated. Um
9819160	9823080	Spend time with your dad. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for understanding. Um
9823320	9825320	I
9825400	9826440	It's gonna be weird
9826440	9832040	Like I need to pick out games that are short or games that can be done under eight hours because basically
9832680	9838680	I want like if we do like four hours for the first stream then the other four to complete the game in the next one
9839560	9840920	um
9840920	9842920	Like it's gonna be weird
9843160	9846360	You literally shoot him all the time. You think you're gonna accidentally talk to chat
9846920	9851480	What like when I'm talking to my dad? No, I'm gonna like show my dad everything. I'm going like these are the reeflings
9851480	9854760	These are all the like fan arts that have made of me. Maybe not the other stuff
9855240	9859960	Uh, this is like me and these are the girls and the girls will say hi and all that jazz
9861160	9865320	Let's call the jury campaigns. We're pretty short. Oh, maybe maybe
9866760	9870120	Make sure you pay a sheebie and a fondle in person for us
9870600	9878440	I didn't realize if someone gifts mercy member like if someone does membership gifts on mercy stream
9879240	9883160	The audio queue is me screaming fondle opism
9884040	9887080	I like mercy. Where did you even grab that from?
9888280	9892680	So, yeah, if you ever wanted to know what happens if you gift a membership on mercy stream
9892760	9894760	It's just me going fondle opism
9895480	9896440	Like
9896440	9900600	She yanked I had no idea she did that. I must have tickled her pink
9900920	9906760	I didn't it tickled everyone pink. I didn't think the name was that bad. I thought it was funny
9907720	9912760	Like oh, you're going to remember if a vtuber comes out and calls themselves fondle a bosom or you know, like
9914520	9918200	If I can only stream for four hours and who's going to yap to the reeflings for the other five
9918440	9924360	Literally, I'm like veal or girls girls besties. You're going to need to step up the reeflings are going to be uh needing
9924840	9926120	A yap off
9926120	9930200	Okay, you all start better start yapping about your special interests to put them asleep
9930360	9935960	They the reeflings cannot go to sleep unless they've heard of either one a capitalist rant
9936200	9938520	Two a rant about some random subject that
9938680	9942120	Reminded me of something because someone mentioned something really obtuse
9942600	9948600	Um or some sort of like video game relation thing. Okay, so girls get on it. Uh, I'm sure they'll do just fine
9949320	9951160	um
9951160	9954360	Yes, it's terrible, but it's absolutely hilarious. She's a memer too, you know
9955240	9957240	listen first is a
9957400	9960120	Family first, but you're my family reefling
9961320	9964120	It feels it feels horrible being pulled apart
9964680	9966440	like but
9966440	9969080	Still four hours. I think is more than adequate
9969960	9971080	Hopefully
9971080	9976840	Hopefully I don't have reefing I'm coping on now. There are times I will see what my dad's wanting to because there'll be days where
9977000	9982360	We don't go out and do anything. So I might be able to squeeze in a cheeky endurance here and there
9984120	9986120	um
9986120	9988120	But I'll probably have to
9989000	9993160	Go and like talk to him or like five minute intervals at like every hour or something
9993480	9998280	Just so he's just so I'm I'm still here dad. I'm still here. I'm just yapping away
9999080	10000200	uh
10000200	10006280	Him listening to the absolute ridiculous conversations we get up to he'll be like what's been sest
10007000	10010840	What is bindo about you don't want to know dad? You don't want to know
10011480	10013480	So
10015080	10020200	I say that as if my dad isn't uh doesn't know about internet culture to be honest. So it doesn't really matter
10020600	10022600	It doesn't matter in the end. Um
10022600	10026360	We need every five minutes of your dad because we need to thank him. Oh, no
10026440	10030920	He's like insert legal name here and legal address kind of uh parent
10031400	10037000	So yeah, no not happening. Um, he might knock on door. He told me I was um
10037720	10040120	What's that talking to him a wee bit ago?
10040440	10044440	Um, and he was like I might bang on the door just so you know, I'm awake and I'm like great
10044440	10048680	So I get to have a heart attack and freak out. Sure. Give him a patreon subs
10050840	10053400	Meet that refund right there meet that refund right there. No
10054440	10055640	um
10055640	10061720	No, he didn't he doesn't he doesn't know those kind of no, then he knows that um, you know a voice slag
10062040	10068520	Um and all that but no, uh, he no no, you know, you know, no none of that none of that
10069400	10074840	Uh, no, not that kind of path. No, he's not a step dad. Um, put it that way. He's not step dad. He's he's mad at
10075160	10076440	mad at
10076440	10082520	Um, but yes, I need to think of like shorter games. I think stray is probably going to be on the roster
10083400	10084920	Um
10084920	10089800	You're wrong for that one chief. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna you're you kind of wrong for that one
10090200	10093720	Um, like actual dad, but not a dad. I like I see
10094840	10099000	Hope we get are you winning strongy? Oh, do you want him to do voice lines just for the hell of it?
10101000	10106680	I was gonna see if I can do that halo playthrough with them, but I don't know if it's possible because
10109320	10110520	Um
10110520	10113880	It's take it. I don't know if I could set them up on it or not
10114600	10117080	I might just do like the classic interview
10117480	10121000	Thing like if you guys have any questions for my dad because I'm sure when I was going to be like
10121080	10126040	What was it like that your daughter's a slag and then he goes well the house is paid off and I get to retire next year
10126040	10131000	So feels pretty good. And then it's like, oh, everyone gets rolled in smoke that has ever said anything nasty
10132600	10138840	Um make it a video. Yes. I thought about doing like an interview video where it's like because vtubers make it such a big deal
10139480	10141480	My parents know I'm a vtuber
10143320	10145320	Like
10145320	10150040	Would they not know that you work at Tescos as well? Am I missing some key elemental factor?
10150360	10153640	Do your parents like not just you know
10154280	10161000	Do your parents not root for you and everything you do like are they not in your corner being like? Yeah, that's amazing. Go strongy go
10161880	10163880	No
10163960	10166920	Well, that's what I have anyway, so it's not it's never been like a
10167720	10174120	Oh my god, my parents don't know what I'm doing. Please don't tell it. Well, of course my parents know what I'm doing
10174120	10176120	I'm having a fucking carry on
10176760	10180520	Do you think if you think I can't stop yam to you guys I'd be telling everything
10181400	10183400	My parents know every little detail
10186120	10188120	Well, I tell you a secret
10189480	10192600	A strongy mama strongy like she be
10194760	10196760	I
10198360	10200360	Mama strongy is a harem
10201160	10202120	and
10202120	10206200	She really likes her voice and she finds her voice quite soothing
10207240	10209720	And she's like oh, she has a really good voice really good voice. Yeah
10211080	10212840	um
10212840	10219400	She got on at me about emi's chest, so I don't talk to emi about I don't talk about emi to her
10220200	10225080	Because she was like a strongy. I'm no sure about that and I'm like look mom
10226520	10228520	Mom you have to understand
10228680	10231640	Peytan is in Peytan stonks are in
10232520	10234520	What does dad think about she be?
10235000	10237720	I don't think dad really has much of an opinion. He doesn't really say much
10238440	10243000	He like knows everyone's designs. I tell you what I'll get him to record his reaction to the designs
10243000	10245480	I could probably do that in the interview type thing with him
10246440	10251160	And be like because I've told them countless times. I'm called strongy
10251240	10252840	He knows I'm called strongy
10252840	10257960	And I know for a fact if I sit him down and record and be like name this feature bar he'll go
10258760	10260760	um
10260760	10261960	Oh
10261960	10263960	And he can't come out of them
10264520	10269560	strongy's mum's a hates flies. No, she doesn't hate that she's flat
10270760	10272760	She dislikes the
10273480	10275480	Young girl appearance
10275480	10279800	Um of emi and she thought it was a bit messed up and I'm like like I can see it
10279800	10284840	But I've been staring at icing emi for over a year now. It's just thing. I like it doesn't mean anything
10285800	10289320	Like I tried to be like well, it's just the opposite of a cleavage really
10289320	10293320	It's just a concave chest because she's got nothing there and mum was named
10294760	10299560	She was kind of seeing it and she was kind of no seeing it and she was like right as long as yous are all safe and happy
10299720	10303400	That's all she's as long as yous are all safe and happy. That's my mum
10305160	10307160	The fact that it's a lollipop I
10307960	10309960	aim my mum's
10310120	10314120	Experience with like japanese and anime and that I forced her to watch kill the kill with me
10314520	10318920	Which has a lot of fan service and she was like strongy. What is this fish and I'm like honestly
10319800	10323640	It is actually quite embarrassing watching anime in front of your parents. So don't recommend that
10324360	10326360	Oh
10326680	10333080	Lollipop love everyone involved is an adult the end end of story. Yes, everyone is safe. Everyone is happy everyone
10334840	10337960	Ah, yes, yeah kill kill son. I love kill kill
10339480	10343080	There's a very good video game and kill kill
10345080	10347800	I uh a fan game
10349640	10351640	A fan game of kill kill
10351960	10355080	And it is it is insane quality
10356280	10360760	It's not a fighting game. No, um, we're a bit tied up in the game
10362600	10367000	Is it by zone it might be because the quality was off the charts of the game
10367000	10372600	Like honestly like something the development team for the anime made themselves. I was like good. Oh, I know that one
10372840	10379560	I used to go absolutely nuts for that. I cannot have countless times. I have spilled my ink to it
10379960	10381960	It is a fantastic game
10383240	10388040	Um, it's outrageous. I know but I don't care
10393160	10397560	Fun fact, bible black was my introduction. Have I seen that? I don't think I have
10398200	10401080	My dad likes to watch anime with me sometimes the one he likes the most
10401640	10405640	Was his high school at the dead. I wonder why oh, no, is it bad?
10405960	10411400	Gaming bless your heart. I'm trying. I'm trying
10413800	10415800	Oh, I know you mean gaming isn't it?
10416360	10423000	Do you see yourself playing on elsewhere? Yeah. Um, there's this orc game that I'm absolutely tantalized by that
10423000	10426280	I've never played it. I absolutely want to do like a
10427400	10433000	Type of like live like we play it and do stuff together live type of stream
10433800	10435560	um
10436600	10440760	Uh, my only issue
10443960	10446360	I wanted it to be free
10449000	10451400	But someone raised the issue
10455240	10462040	That having it accessible like that negates the audios and I'm like, oh, well I kind of agree
10463000	10466920	Which is a bit shitty. I don't know what the solution is to that situation is
10467960	10473240	I don't have a solution yet. I still have time july is kind of when it you know things start to break
10474840	10480440	What do you mean by that? Um, so patreon's appeal is because you get very unique audios of scenarios
10481320	10483320	um
10483400	10486600	But I really don't want another subscription
10487160	10489160	I
10490760	10493080	Um, I don't want to charge anymore
10493640	10498440	Because the fucking membership was one dollar more than I wanted it to be so I'm already raging at that
10500040	10502920	And I don't have a solution yet. I don't have a
10504200	10506040	How does it negate it?
10506040	10508680	Because it's like here's free access
10509320	10511320	to this content
10511320	10514280	That arguably could be a lot better
10515240	10519720	Um, because some people aren't into the audios for like the rp aspect
10521480	10523480	And it's like well, you can
10523480	10525480	you know
10526200	10531080	It's uh, it's a bit tricky to navigate at this stage. I don't have a solution
10532360	10534280	I don't have a
10534280	10536280	finality either
10536360	10538360	I
10538600	10540600	Cheap vods via subscription
10541560	10546440	Now vauding I might agree to a very small even if it's like a dollar
10546520	10550360	I kid you not a dollar for vods. I think is agreeable
10551000	10554760	For the actual live stream. I think all you would have to do is follow
10555240	10559080	And that's it. I'm quite happy with that solution. That might be the solution
10560120	10562120	A dollar for vod access
10563640	10565640	I think is fair
10566040	10570120	And then free access to the actual live if you can get it in time
10570440	10574120	If it's all strong even that punishes people that have worked that punishes people in this time
10575480	10577240	Rob
10577240	10582680	Look at any other agency and be like, are you getting value for money compared to us? Yes or no
10583560	10588760	Please I am trying. I'm trying to make everyone happy. It is not possible. Please work with me
10589160	10595080	Work with me. These girls need to move out. These girls need to eat these girls need to find success these girls
10595480	10596760	You know
10596760	10598760	Fucking give them your money
10600760	10606520	Be nice to the girls. They're trying to achieve stuff. Okay. I've already got everything I need with my wiflings. Okay
10610600	10615960	You'll be to watch small fee votes is a pretty common setup. Okay
10617880	10621960	There's no perfect solution, but that is one. Yes, there is no perfect solution
10622360	10624840	In the wise words of captain
10629240	10632120	I cannot remember his name of the star chick enterprise
10633000	10639160	Captain Picard you can do everything right and still it goes wrong or something like that. I can't remember
10640600	10645800	I don't see if it will affect patreon stuff. Okay. Well, hopefully it doesn't if it does then
10646360	10647560	I
10647560	10652200	Because um patron if you didn't know uh if you ever feel but oh, it's only five dollars
10652840	10658680	And patreon statistically and very shortly should and will be the girl's biggest income source
10659000	10662040	Um very quickly. So don't be afraid to support mom patreon
10662600	10668840	Uh undercut in the market undercut the market five dollars for four audios undercut in the market as well as access and archive to anything
10668840	10670840	They produce on youtube. Yeah
10671720	10673720	Okay
10674040	10679880	Undercut the market. Um, yes, it should actually be their biggest income source. Um, that's the plan anyway
10679960	10682040	It looks like it's actually happening. You know that
10682840	10684040	and
10684040	10687560	I can only speak for myself at this point
10689560	10691560	But
10691560	10693560	Yeah, my harry on
10693560	10699960	Are you kidding me right now hit by the pope. I wanted to stay up for your stream since it starts at 2 a.m
10700040	10706440	Here, but I ended up heaping out of comfort of your voice. Thank you for rambling. Thank you flaws for the super chat
10707240	10712520	Are you got floppy as your profile picture? That's floppy, isn't it? It is. Um
10713320	10718200	Thank you for the super chat and uh, please rest well unless you're up already
10718600	10720600	You tried to stay up for the stream but passed out
10720840	10722200	Oh
10722200	10724200	We've got a thousand wines bomb
10725000	10729960	Flop a little big flop like who's gonna go. Hmm. Now that this free. I don't want to sell up on patreon hard
10730600	10732600	You'd be surprised. Um
10733640	10737400	Some of the patreon feedback is like that shit insane
10737480	10742040	I could probably talk about it a bit more as time develops. I might even make a short out of it, honestly
10742600	10744840	um, you would be surprised how
10745480	10751720	People's like exit survey you can leave it if you leave someone's patreon. You can leave a message and it's like an exit survey
10752680	10754680	You would be surprised on the reasons
10755400	10758680	Why someone is like i'm no longer supporting you type thing
10759640	10762440	My biggest problem is if I want to watch all the girls
10762760	10767560	I don't have time to have to make sacrifices that I don't yet know if I am ready to make
10768440	10770600	Oh, thank you our own reaper
10771400	10773880	for the five and um
10775800	10777800	Yeah the
10780840	10785000	Yeah, it's kind of hard to keep up with all the girls at once. Uh, definitely not that easy. Um
10786360	10789400	But what was I saying? I've completely forgotten. No
10790760	10796040	My brain's too small to do multiple things at once. Can I give an example an example of what i'm so sorry
10796040	10798040	I've completely forgotten what I was talking about
10798920	10800920	um
10801160	10803160	I
10803480	10808200	Hearing the girls are really happy about how they are doing. Hopefully they can all make their situation better. Yeah, like I think
10808840	10813800	Emmy's want to move out. Aces want to move out. Azura's want to move out. Shuby's want to move out. Everyone's want to move out
10815560	10817560	Uh mercy wants to move out because
10818680	10820680	Her parents make it a nightmare to record
10821960	10824120	I'm not even I'm not even gonna pretend
10824840	10826840	It should be like oh my parents are up. Sorry
10827240	10831160	No, that's fine. That's fine. Just leave it. Leave it last minute. It's fine. It doesn't make a difference
10832040	10833800	Oh crazy
10833800	10839320	Patreon feedback. Uh, yeah stuff like uh no longer want to support because
10840200	10842200	um
10842760	10846280	You made this one audio that I don't enjoy and it's like
10849880	10851080	Now don't get me wrong
10851080	10853400	Please don't ever feel forced to like throw your money at
10853960	10856120	Creators if you genuinely don't enjoy what they put out
10856440	10862600	But some of the stuff is like you made one audio. I do not like out of so many audios that you have made
10862840	10864840	I am gone and it was like, okay
10864920	10870120	Why would you even leave that in the feedback like don't be realistic? I don't know if it like you need to be told to your face
10870120	10874680	There's no way in heck one creator can make something that you enjoy a hundred percent of the time
10874840	10881880	Like as soon as I come out saying that I didn't mind sounding. Oh, oh, strongy bad. Oh, right. That's it. Get it out right now
10881960	10884440	I've got straw. Um
10885800	10887800	I'm teasing I'm teasing
10890280	10896040	Uh five minutes and 56 seconds into the audio you made a mouth sound. I did not like honestly it can be like that
10896520	10900520	Um, I'll definitely show some examples strongy's a bad girl
10902680	10906840	Who made you listen to that audio like come on. Yes, it definitely feels a bit like
10907160	10908440	I
10908440	10911320	Don't know if people feel forced to put something
10911480	10915400	I don't know how it looks when you like disengage from someone's patreon subscription
10915880	10918920	But I don't know if people feel forced to put an answer down
10919160	10924440	You do not have to put an answer down and insult the creator on the way out just uh, just a quick tip for you
10924520	10926760	You know, you don't have to insult the creator on the way out
10926760	10930680	Even though like you literally put your money where your mouth was and supported the creator like is
10931240	10935960	I will definitely make a short about it and show some examples because it's uh rather humorous
10936040	10938040	It can be rather humorous
10940040	10943640	Or when they make an assumption about everything you'll make in the future off of two posts
10944200	10946360	Bruh, I felt so bad for she be
10948520	10956040	I felt so bad for she be she was getting a bit of flak because the first audio just happened to be an s scenario
10957480	10959480	And she made three
10959640	10963960	d scenarios and one s and it was voted on the one s
10964840	10969800	And she got so much flak and I'm like do I have to like come out and explain like how this works?
10970600	10972040	like
10972040	10977880	I am I am happy to say we do have a schedule that will be posted next month
10978760	10980760	Where you can see what's coming up ahead
10980920	10983800	So um, if you are on a monthly
10984440	10986360	basis like you
10986360	10989960	You sign up and then sign off again. You'll be able to see what's coming up
10989960	10994520	I will try my best to put the tags, but I'm absolutely rubbish at making tags. I'm not used to it
10995720	11001880	So it's hard to get used to it because I'm struggling me. I'm struggling. I'm not smart enough for this
11003800	11008200	Okay, when this pops we're going to make a cup of tea and get some food in our belly because I'm getting a bit hungry
11009240	11014680	Yeah, I think that would have changed the results. There is going to be that first plot d
11015400	11016600	scenario
11016680	11017640	I
11017640	11025080	I just I didn't write it at the time because I at the point I had actually wrote 3d for her
11026200	11027640	And then I was like, okay
11027640	11034840	She needs one s at least and somehow you guys miraculously voted on the one s. I was literally the odds were what one in four
11036040	11039320	But anyway, I thought it was really funny her first audio was sd
11040600	11042600	I mean you do have to remember
11044200	11046040	Am I allowed to say that?
11046040	11048040	No, maybe no
11048840	11052440	Maybe another time. Have you thought about posting demos? Um
11054760	11060600	No, um, I actually no, I don't mean this in a bad way. Please do not think I'm
11062040	11063720	83
11063720	11065560	That's fantastic
11065560	11071320	Um, please do not think I am honing in on your comment. Um, even though I am responding to your question though
11072280	11074280	I do not believe
11074680	11079800	In the need this sounds terrible and I hope it doesn't come across as bad as it sounds
11080440	11084840	I don't think a preview is needed for such a low
11086120	11093800	Undercut of the market as well as you can try it for for you can trial it for five dollars
11095320	11098360	You can trial it. You don't have to keep it on afterwards
11099400	11100760	um
11100760	11109800	I do under like and the girls already post stuff for free on the alt twitter like I feel like you get enough of a
11111000	11115000	Situation of is this going to be worth it or not? And if it's not worth it
11115560	11121320	Hopefully that fight, you know, you're not going to spend five dollars that you actually need like so
11121800	11123560	It's kind of like
11123560	11125080	It's not even a lose
11125080	11130440	There's like no loss as well because you've actually directly supported the girl like that you've helped them like
11130440	11135960	Move out. You've helped them maybe upgrade their equipment that um, they didn't want to ask management for
11136440	11138440	isura
11138440	11143720	Per isura. She was too shy to ask for a new iphone. So I had to buy her one like right before debut
11144920	11146920	um
11147080	11150600	But she got it so our iphone's all juicy as far as i'm aware
11153000	11157880	Is there a no yeah, it just seemed like there's a lot of extremes for the first people
11158600	11160360	and
11160600	11162600	I
11162600	11164600	Actually can't make a comment
11168600	11171800	I mean the first the first month is always chaos. Um
11172760	11177480	People getting used to folk folk filtering themselves folk getting filtered like it's just the way it is
11177960	11180760	Um, but like once things settle down, I mean
11181400	11184520	I mean she I think I was in the the reef lines are all settled down
11184520	11189480	Are we not like we're already jumping straight into endurance stream. We've got elden ring next week. Hello. No
11189720	11192040	We've got elden ring in a couple of days like hello
11193000	11197480	Um, I'm ordering take away on elden ring day. Yeah, you don't have to tell me twice. I assure you
11198120	11199560	um
11199560	11204040	I will absolutely like I feel like we're we're settled and you guys already know where the start score is with me
11204360	11209640	Um, you know, you have to let the girls cook a little bit, you know, let them get comfy and all that jazz
11210040	11216360	You're gonna catch she be stream. Oh she'd be live anything for any harem members. Sheepster's live mercy collab
11216920	11221160	Uh, see you in the mercy collab. Yes, I will see you in the mercy club. Thank you for the tip. Bye
11222200	11228840	Um, please do watch emmy is collabing with uh a person's name that I forget right now
11229880	11236280	Unfortunately, and she be is live with inscription if you enjoy inscription. Yes, the elden ring dlc is coming out. Um
11237000	11239240	I bloody hope I've done it on the right day
11239880	11248120	I will download the dlc. We are starting a fresh save. Um, I don't know if it's one of those things where you can
11249240	11255720	Just run to the dlc area. I mean, maybe if it's appropriate or unless it's like harder than kaolin type thing
11257960	11260440	Can't wait to play elden ring. It's out today
11262760	11266040	That I purposely push it a day back is elden ring tomorrow
11266280	11268280	Eaps
11270200	11272200	Oh, no, I don't want ashes
11274440	11276440	Elden ring today
11276520	11279160	Show me my youtube channel so I can look at my own
11280280	11282280	Um
11282280	11284280	So I can look at my own
11285240	11289160	Schedule all children. Yeah, elden rings tomorrow. I'm heart rate monitor and all that. Yeah
11292200	11295400	Elden ring dlc unlocks in like two hours. Yes, make sure you
11296120	11298120	purchase
11299800	11302200	Um, yeah, don't be surprised
11302920	11309560	Um, when you see a ton of vtuber's playing elden ring, I think all of us are about to go fucking mental for it
11311400	11316920	Man, it breaks my heart. Strone's providing so much literally and figure out the quality and quantity why sometimes even for free
11316920	11318920	And some people are still asking for more
11318920	11325480	Uh, it's human nature to want more. It's fine. I understand how it works. Like there's no point in being like, you know mad
11326040	11328040	um
11328360	11333320	Like you can only do so much and um, you know, you know, you're in yourself your limitations
11333320	11338440	Like I wouldn't push myself to like have a silly goal of like one asmr video pair
11339240	11343240	A 1000 subs type thing is the most dangerous of all the girls
11343800	11347320	She sounds so sweet and innocent and then you look at her patreon
11347320	11352920	And I feel like I should report myself to the police. What steady on I wrote her plots
11353880	11359080	Uh, I will say they're they're my plots. I've been written for roughly two to three months
11359080	11361080	Some of them are actually only two months
11361080	11366200	Uh, and then the scriptmaster comes in and I think the scriptmaster will just work as far better than mine
11366920	11369800	Um, so I think you'll like them a heck of a lot more
11370440	11376600	Which reminds me I actually need to send off an editing batch away because me completed her july audio space
11378440	11380680	Shawnee you're maoshi, but I do love all the girls and care about them
11380760	11387880	I want all of yours to be happy. Yes. I want them to be happy too. It's um, it's very interesting some some um
11390280	11392280	I you know
11392440	11394440	I thought it was a pretty
11394600	11399480	Honestly, it just feels like I've spawned in another five strongies and you know reeflings
11400120	11402200	If that makes sense like, you know
11402200	11403640	Mercy snippets
11403640	11407640	Strongly reeflings like it feels like I've just spawned in another five that just do their own thing and have a good time
11407720	11410200	And I mean that's what it's all about at the end of the day
11410840	11412520	I don't think it's you know
11412520	11414520	Fucking chasing numbers and oh my god
11415160	11418280	Must must must have this must do this must do that and it's like no, I really have fun
11418280	11423480	Like I get to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey, I'd love to do ASMR with you
11423560	11429080	I'll write the script. It's like a fun little small goofy thing. You know no stress no fuss like it lets me
11430200	11435080	You know interact with people in the vtuber community like it's it's like such a little blessing. Um
11436040	11437320	I mean like our
11437320	11444120	Holy shit. I get to claim that this is work. I get to claim that sitting in edgeville on world three eight right now
11444600	11446280	uh doing wine
11446280	11451720	Uh talking to reeflings is work in quotation marks like nah nah the same work
11453800	11459000	Less like a corporal more of a guild of indies honestly, it's probably a more accurate thingy. Um
11459720	11464280	Just that there was a lot of massive money back in to be honest. Um
11465240	11468440	Yes, I'm going to try and get the girls at least 5k subscribers this
11468840	11474200	Month, so I'm going to send Icy and Azura an ASMR. I'm going to get Azura to do heartbeat ASMR
11474920	11476920	and kissing
11476920	11482120	Maybe not kissing because I actually saw an ASMRist got their video removed for kissing
11484280	11490840	I think Azura sleep aids heartbeat cuddle sound soft breathing would go very well
11491160	11495720	She be actually has a sleep aid audio coming out. I ordered the artwork
11496760	11501800	Um, and it's already here and I need to edit and get it ready to click send
11503000	11505560	What do you mean? I'm doing far too much
11506360	11510200	Work all at once. What are you talking about? No, not the kissing. Yeah, I don't know
11510920	11516200	No, so you can do like soft breathing, but for some reason if you've got a 3d or you can't go up in the ear
11517000	11521640	Make it make sense. Like I I've no got clue. Make it make sense. Thank you again iron reaper for the tip
11521640	11525400	I'm pretty sure I didn't read your name out because we were all thinking about how evil emmy is
11525560	11527560	But emmy's a good kind of evil
11529000	11531000	Um, oh my tummy is rumbling
11531480	11535720	I can't believe it. I may actually my human body needs to eat and hydrate
11537240	11540600	Um, do you have a sleep aid audio coming out? Yes, I
11540760	11543400	Haven't made it. I haven't written it
11543880	11547800	But if there's anything you want in a sleep aid audio, let me know
11548840	11553400	Um, I was probably just going to do the old classic route. Is there a cat in this room?
11556520	11558520	Vigo
11558920	11560920	I'm losing it
11561080	11564120	I'm so dehydrated. I'm losing it and I think Vigo's in the room right now
11564680	11569960	Uh, I might have to start making a lot of the sus ASMR member only
11575560	11577480	Hmm
11577480	11581720	I don't want to overwhelm the girls. Um with work requirements
11582520	11588760	Um, like for me, you know streaming doing three member streaming weekend streaming every day is not problem
11588840	11592040	But I am aware that people have limitations
11592600	11594120	that I don't
11594120	11595800	um
11595800	11597800	And they experience things that I don't
11598280	11600120	um
11600120	11604200	So it makes it kind of like not a dangerous playing field
11604360	11612120	But like I try to make things as super easy and simple like that ASMR. I got she be to talk to make sorry
11612360	11614200	um
11614200	11619800	I think it was like less than five minutes of dialogue and I know people might be like, oh my god
11619800	11622280	Why aren't you giving us a massive amount of dialogue?
11622360	11627560	And it was like I need to manage the girl's stress levels like needy streamer overload
11627640	11631640	I cannot overload them with work whilst they're trying to stream
11632040	11637320	I'm trying to entertain because they might struggle with things that I don't experience because I don't feel uncomfortable
11637480	11640520	Or like I just feel literally right at home. Um
11641800	11647480	But humble brag. No, I'm not even like in a mean way. I just like I need to be so careful and so cautious
11648120	11650600	And like it's scary because like
11651080	11655240	It's not like the girls have a hp bar and a stress bar that I can look at
11655640	11660280	And be like, are you telling me the truth? Like I was checked in on emmy and emmy's like, I'm fine
11660360	11664440	I'm cloud nine. I was like pinky promise me right now because I I don't know
11664600	11668200	I actually don't know if you're good, but I think emmy is good and she was good and all that, you know
11669080	11672520	Like if the girls had freaking hp bars and stress bars
11672520	11675080	I would be a lot easier to navigate what I want them to do
11675480	11680920	But like at the moment I'm having to be like patient and let them settle and like they've taken break days
11681000	11684600	And maybe on break days they'll record the youtube ASMR's for me like
11685240	11687080	It's um
11687080	11690920	And who's thinking about you the reeflings are thinking about me silly
11692360	11695320	The reeflings give me energy the reeflings give me life
11695960	11697960	Hmm
11698600	11704440	Literally I rolled out of bed 10 minutes before stream. I was moody. I made a cup of tea
11705240	11712200	Um, I got set up the moment I come on live. I go in a massive round in rave. You guys fill me with with energy
11713080	11716360	With determination. I've been filled with your determination
11717640	11718600	Um
11718600	11723720	Like yeah, you don't you don't you don't all worry about me. I get life like when you guys comment
11723720	11728680	Oh, your ASMR was so cute. All the stream was so cute. I'm a vod watcher. Here's a clip like
11730760	11733800	Uh fun facts Johnny. We love you. Love you to replay
11734680	11739400	If they had hp bars emmy's would enjoy if hers was low munkos
11741400	11745400	Uh, I would actually mess around with the idea of a feature management game
11745400	11749160	I think that's very on topic, but uh, I don't have the development team
11749240	11752600	I don't have a development team at all for video games, but I do have the funds
11753080	11757160	But I would have to write out the game and I don't have time to write out the game right now
11759000	11761640	I wrote out the bare bones of my cookie clicker game
11762600	11764200	um
11764200	11766760	Totally not inspired by legend of zelda by the way, uh
11768280	11770680	Yeah, I do not have time to write video games
11770760	11774920	Which is annoying because it's one of the projects I'm gonna do as that what the call the kids call it now
11774920	11780760	She steals our energy. He's like, he's real emmy's hp bar has an inverse relationship. We're a happy bar
11781800	11787240	Gen two game just saying oh, I already know what the gen two game is and the gen three game is I've already picked it out
11788760	11794040	Um, I realized very quickly whilst I was commissioning the gen one game
11794280	11799800	Oh wait games actually take a lot of money and time to produce. Um, so I already know what the
11800760	11806200	The gen two is uh free to play video game of an alternative nature is um
11807000	11810920	I'd be very surprised if anyone would guess it's because
11813080	11816440	It's based on pre-established games, but we've
11817960	11820840	We've borneified it and you basically can
11821720	11825100	Swing with the girls in the generation in that game
11825580	11827100	I
11827100	11829100	Will go like
11829180	11833900	She's 10 steps ahead of us when I say it took a year for the girls to pop up
11833980	11837900	I wasn't kidding like you have to think ahead like you have to think of events
11837900	11842140	You have to think of their birthdays. You have to think of their doughnut thongs. You have to think of alternative outfits
11842460	11843820	You have to think
11843820	11848540	Right, uh, we've made the offer if they sign on another year. They can get another alternative outfit
11848540	11852460	All right, the girl's gonna want a group alternative outfit of a certain theme like
11853020	11857580	There's like a possibility of a timeline that next year in june
11858540	11864140	If we're all standing we might all have like goth variations of our designs something like that. Um
11865340	11870060	Like there's a lot. Please not candy crush. No, it's not candy crush
11871820	11873660	You're welcome
11873660	11880940	Read and list bonus months. Yes, like we so the split is 80 20 and if they sign on another year that increases to
11881260	11882460	um
11882460	11884460	85 15
11885100	11886540	um
11886540	11889420	And they also get an alternative costume
11890460	11892620	on the house by
11892620	11894620	Like the development team
11895420	11899420	But they can like dictate what all outfit they want. That's perfectly fine. We don't have an issue with that
11899420	11903020	But we pay for it as I like thanks for signing on for another year. Yippee
11905180	11908060	Will it be a card game? No, there's not a card game
11908780	11911660	I actually can only remember the first two
11912460	11914220	um
11914220	11916220	The first two generations game
11917260	11919260	type
11919900	11923660	Based well, it'd be a mobile. No, it's a mobile. Are you joking me?
11925020	11928220	Hi, I just got home from working realize I missed sharing a smart any chance
11928220	11935820	It's currently on patreon at this moment in time. Um, I'm going to upload it to twitter
11936540	11940540	I need to buy twitter
11941500	11943500	Oh, we popped. Yay
11944380	11945820	What are we?
11945820	11950780	We're 83. Wait, we may actually make 85. My prediction is true. I can't believe that
11951500	11953500	Wow, what's that? Yeah
11953660	11960300	Cuttles turns into a sea jargon just like pokemon evolution cleolix and animal. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good split. Yes, um
11961500	11965100	because of the freedoms and how low is the
11965980	11972940	As I've said this before the actual upkeep the up. Yeah. Yeah, the upkeep the upkeep really ain't that much
11973500	11977180	Ain't that much at all? I don't know what to tell you. It does not cost that much. Um
11980700	11986700	Probably the biggest cost right now is clippers unironically sending away these clip edits to be made
11987420	11988460	um
11988460	11991340	I have three clippers for the girls and they all unanimously
11991820	11995740	Unanimously needed a break all roughly at the same time
11996460	12002380	Um, which has led me to seek out a clipper for my own strongy stuff at the moment
12003020	12006380	Uh, because I've completely abandoned like my youtube shorts
12006700	12013500	Um in favor of the girls at the moment. Um, shebe's shorts are currently all getting limited
12014220	12017980	So I can't promote her shorts. I can't put advertisement money into her shorts
12018380	12024460	Um her praise short was supposed I was going to put money into for advertisement. I can't because she's got too much
12025980	12031180	About 1.8k wines. Oh god. I don't know if I'm gonna make it in this room. Um
12032940	12034940	But yeah, we we struggle
12037180	12042940	Remember to rest by the way you have a collab too. Yes. No, I am I am I'm going offline when
12043820	12051420	Uh, Azura comes on which gives me two hours rest, which is more than adequate. Um, I'm talking to mercy one hour before
12052140	12053660	the stream starts
12053660	12055900	um, and
12055900	12061020	I just wanted to get some cheeky runescaping in because there's a few levels. We uh, definitely need to get up
12061980	12065900	How do you work on their videos or what? Um, maybe like an edit and thumbnail
12066700	12069100	um, so I basically
12069980	12071020	um
12071020	12073660	Go through their clips and if I find something clippable
12073900	12078860	I will send it to an editor, but I've actually asked them to do that because I can't scour all their clips at once
12078860	12080860	It's not possible. Um
12082140	12088300	But I have pre-made shorts I make of them that's like insider knowledge about the vtuber agency or insider vtuber stuff
12088380	12092060	Like mercy's shorts. Oh my god. I'm so sorry to expose mercy like this
12093340	12096140	Mercy never wrote any of her shorts. That's all me
12097100	12102380	The short about like senpai am I blonde did you look should I been blonde or like this is what goes wrong as a v
12102380	12105580	These are that's me. I'm sorry. It's all me
12107100	12109100	I'm telling her what to say
12109640	12116140	Exposed called it. Yes. Um, but it's me. That's pulling the strings. It's me. That's wrote these scripts and
12116700	12121980	It's me piloting her mecca and sending it off to the editor because I don't want to stress the talents out
12122380	12129420	With like having to do all these bits and bobs in between streaming. It's not good for it to reduce their stress as much as possible
12129580	12131100	I'm like
12131100	12136140	Putting it on me because I can handle these stress levels. Like I don't even feel stress
12136540	12142940	You know what I feel frustrated that I've let the girls down with a short scenario, but it's slowly evening out like what we're
12143980	12148060	I think I'm probably gonna try and see if I can find another editor to have on standby
12149100	12150460	because
12150460	12154220	We've got someone that skill isn't quite there yet and I'm like
12154540	12158940	I've need to pay the big bucks to get the edits. I want a new pair. You're such a hard-working beast
12159500	12161500	Stroney is actually all a veeler
12162860	12166620	Yeah, I wasn't kidding when I said I was icy snow paws
12167420	12170620	Fuck I can't do our accent right now because I'm smiling
12171260	12173340	I'm doing the most stereotypical accent
12174300	12180140	Dada, do you like my photos on twitter at twitter.com slash
12181100	12183100	ic snow
12183980	12185980	Do you like my tummy data?
12188540	12192220	I can't do it. I can't do it. It's terrible. If we ever do
12192940	12196940	Like april fools. I have to go on ic because I can't do anyone else's voice

12219580	12221580	Bless you. Thank you

12293500	12295500	Yeah, ready? Okay
12295500	12297500	Such an ASMR announcement
12297580	12303020	Hmm reefling sometimes you have to force this woman to take care of herself. Remember that. Thank you for the great yap fest
12303180	12308700	Gonna give she be some love. Yes, please do not be afraid to show any of my gen mates love. I have absolutely no
12309500	12311500	Whatever the word is is a jealousy
12311900	12318140	What is it? You know what we should actually create a name for the vtuber jealousy phenomenon
12318700	12322380	I'm here for it. We should create a new term right now in the english language
12323660	12325660	for when a vtuber is like
12326460	12332540	Don't watch other vtuber's but like not because they're like yandere and like mercy doesn't count because she's yandere, you know what i'm saying
12333180	12338140	But like we should actually call it and it's like it's the female vtuber phenomenon
12338380	12343580	Where they get jealous envy tuba. Maybe envy. Mmm
12345340	12347340	Envy cute possessive girlfriend
12347980	12351660	Extranged tuba possessive. It's literally called a vendetta. Wait
12352380	12354140	What's the definition of it?
12354140	12355660	Vendetta
12355660	12361740	The effort initiative all done. Let's pull up google for this one lads because I actually don't know it off the top of my head
12361740	12363740	What a vendetta is
12364380	12371660	Let me just brew some wine then you make me vendetta a blood feud in which the family of the murdered person seeks vengeance
12375500	12384060	Or a prolonged bitter quarrel with with or campaign against someone. Okay. That one seems more like it
12385740	12390060	A bit of a a bit of a bitterness. How about that a bit of bitterness?
12390620	12392620	Yeah, it's probably a bit more
12393100	12394780	Don't be self-centered
12394780	12398220	Wrong definition. Isn't that called parasocial? I don't
12399660	12403180	No, isn't parasocial when someone wants to show up to your house?
12405180	12407980	I thought that's what parasocial the definition of parasocial is
12408620	12411500	When someone genuinely wants to show up to your house. It's like
12412460	12414460	Serion mate. Serion
12414780	12421420	The convention sure show up to the convention my house. No, sorry. Uh, gimme. He's gonna start freaking out. No, that's the stalker
12421980	12426780	Okay, no, that's talk. Wait, so then what's parasocial parasocial is getting attached online
12429740	12431740	There's levels, but yeah, that would be better
12433500	12437660	Yeah, I used to have people that said they were going to show up to my house. Uh, maybe don't do that
12438620	12440620	Maybe don't do that
12441180	12446460	Parasocial is projected one-sided friendship. Parasocial would be me saying strone's my best though when she doesn't even know my name
12447180	12449420	And yet I can read your name in chat right now shopping behavior
12450860	12454060	Is it is it like warped perception of reality?
12456220	12461820	One-sided relationship with someone you've never met so you actually see yourself as someone's significant other. Ah, okay. Okay
12464140	12465500	So
12465580	12470700	It would be reality is not in check. I remember sweet Anita talking about her stalker situation
12470700	12472380	I don't know Benny you guys heard about it
12472540	12478140	It was like the guy literally bought a house across the road from her and would sleep in her garden in that and like peep through
12478140	12479580	her litter box
12479580	12485260	And like wake her up during the night and all that and she's just the police refuse to do anything and she's just like
12485900	12488460	Oh wait, I don't know if there is an update. Maybe I'm making that up
12488700	12494860	But she basically has accepted that the only way the guy's ever gonna be dealt with via the law
12495180	12499580	Is she'll be murdered, which is actually quite a common case
12502140	12509260	For stalking situations, I wouldn't be surprised if there might be new stalking laws coming out in the next few years because
12510540	12512540	uh, yeah
12513100	12518220	The parasocial knife cuts both ways because just just as we get attached to vtuber vtuber get attached to us
12518780	12520860	Yes, I agree with that sentiment
12521820	12524540	And like we said strong, he's my wife and I wasn't joking
12525180	12527180	Ah, right
12527260	12529260	But you know my husband
12529500	12532060	Husband riefling husband riefling has
12533500	12535020	husband
12535020	12535980	sling
12535980	12537500	husband
12537500	12539500	Reef bend reef bend
12541660	12548140	Don't be co-dependent to the corporal. Oh, no. Oh, if I guess it's out of the peeler allegations. I might allow it
12548540	12551420	I just make the honey tea around here
12555500	12556940	That's curious, it's curious
12556940	12561580	It's like one of those forbidden topics you're not supposed to talk about but when you open when you openly talk about it
12561580	12566940	It's like, okay. Okay. We're just getting perspectives in everyone's thought process. Well, it's almost like when you openly discuss things and
12567420	12569580	Instead of just assume things behind closers
12570620	12572620	like wild wild
12573580	12576780	Husbandling husband, that's kind of cute
12577740	12583020	And we're played runescape. So I have no idea what's going on. It seems like a just-chan. It is absolutely a just-chan
12583180	12585820	We are basically doing the crazy crazy task
12586620	12587980	of
12587980	12589020	reducing
12589020	12590220	Oh, it popped
12590220	12591740	84
12591740	12596940	Let's go. Okay. Maybe I should go for food now like actually go for food this time
12598300	12603740	Um, yes. No runescape is just an opportunity for me to yap your ear off for hours on end
12603820	12610780	I'm so sorry. You have fallen for my pranks yet again. You have fallen for my ruse. Um, I have misled you astray
12611420	12617100	And to think that this is just a regular game. It's not. It's just another excuse for me to tell you about the capitalist
12619500	12623340	I keep thinking that level sound is actually a jumpstart. Oh, I'm so sorry. How loud do you listen?
12624140	12627980	Do you not listen on a low volume? Please make sure you're not listening too loud
12628700	12635580	Um, because I will break your eardrums. Uh, when I get too excited. Do I make myself clear that husband briefly?
12636140	12637260	Aw
12637260	12643020	Thank you for the tip Zarian that husband literally me. Have I seen any that come literally me?
12643820	12648620	No, I think our new version is that baby is literally me and I'm the father. I like that
12649260	12652780	I'm enjoying that quite a lot right now. Um
12653740	12660220	The husband and the baby is me. I like that hydration check right. Okay fine fine. I'm freaking I'll go get food
12660300	12664540	I can't believe it. I can't believe my bodily functions need to take priority
12664860	12669260	Man, why can't I just stream for hours on end? Like honestly, don't be so rude
12670460	12673820	But your voice even if excited is fine at high volume the level up is not
12674220	12677900	Okay, even great football you happen. If I had a headless headset
12678060	12681260	I would like take you to the kitchen with me and I'll be like, hi Gimli
12681740	12684860	I bet you Gimli's gonna come flying around the corner the moment I leave this room
12685420	12687980	Thank you for tip, right? I'll be give me four minutes
12687980	12692380	It takes like four minutes for the kettle to boil and I'll see if there's anything I can microwave if not
12693260	12699740	I might be ordering a cheeky takeaway after um, I'll host a I'll be direct into Azura Azura is playing
12701980	12703980	That one game I've already forgotten
12704540	12707500	What's the name of the game Azura is playing?
12708780	12713660	A whole four minutes. I have you on 5.1 surround system. Please bless me. That's Scottish boys. No
12714780	12719580	Yeah, yes Azura is playing Little Nightmares, which is a fantastic 10 out of 10 game
12720060	12724220	Um, I'm very excited to see her playthrough of that and I will be
12724860	12729420	Hopefully if it's a good stream, I might be able to get highlight reel made of that stream
12729660	12735260	I'm gonna see if I can get a buckshot roulette highlight reel made of my stream possibly
12735820	12738220	I think you deserve more takeaway. That's just because
12740140	12743100	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's mm-hmm. Yeah
12743820	12748540	Okay, I will actually go get food and get a drink. Oh, I'm lightheaded because of dehydration
12748620	12754300	I just shook my head up and down there. Okay. I will actually go that was scary. I will be back in four minutes
12759420	12761420	So

13108140	13113580	With a lightheaded moment. I have so much food with me right now. It's like funny. I think so before though

13116300	13119420	Waiting to launch themselves in the down room
13121340	13123340	Okay

13157740	13161660	Chocolate covered raisins, which I've yet to successfully eat. I've taken them out twice now
13162300	13167660	The novel I've got wee blueberry muffin. I don't know if you can hear me spank it a little bit and then

13180700	13183980	Probably keeping me alive right now. Um successfully
13184700	13186060	and
13186060	13190140	Yeah, I'm about to stuff my face and drink and get a ton of sugar in my body because that's scary

13215820	13216780	and
13216780	13218780	It's like really healthy
13218940	13220940	Uh try and eat one
13221500	13227740	Eat one I try and drink one at least every week because I don't eat a lot of fruit
13227740	13232780	But I eat tons of vegetables. She says that she eats cheesy chips that doesn't count. Um
13234940	13240300	But I'll try and have one every week because I think it's keeping the scurvy away
13243340	13244700	Um
13244700	13248460	I just never seem to buy fruit like I feel like it always goes off where it's always like
13249180	13254300	Not like a way too late to eat it and I don't want to be wasteful, you know
13256860	13259340	What percent is juice? What does that mean?
13261820	13266140	A hundred percent no concentrate zero added sugar zero artificial
13267180	13270140	Um it says on the the patent game
13272140	13277740	So it's supposed to be super good for me. Hopefully if not, I've been lied to how dare you how dare I be lied to
13278940	13280940	Mm-hmm
13286460	13289180	Yeah, you have to eat on the day you get it literally like sauce but
13290540	13294460	I've been so disappointed with supermarkets lately that I've been using like
13295020	13300060	independent stores and the quality of the and it's so cheaper and so different quality as well
13301580	13306540	Like these super fucking mental national chains is just like nothing
13309340	13311340	My god
13311580	13317340	You forget how good food tastes until you eat it. Oh, yeah, this should this should bang him
13321980	13326460	Let me shake up my fruit juice so I can uh confirm that I've had my five a day for today
13328620	13329260	Mm
13329260	13333580	They say the Mediterranean diet is the best one you can do because they have like so much fruit and veg in it
13333580	13334940	And fish as well
13334940	13341340	Fish is good for you, but the only fish I can eat the sun's terrible. I'm just so pretty. Oh, I just spilled my juice
13343020	13349340	I spilled a little bit on my mouse mat. So now it gets to be on me and yeah, oh have a napkin. Thank god. I have a napkin
13351820	13354780	Okay bottoms up I uh, we support local businesses
13358060	13359660	Mm-hmm
13359740	13363740	Oh this shit busting for real. I love mango mangoes delicious fruit
13364940	13370380	Yeah, like cod fish and chips haddock is the only fish I can eat because it's fucking battered and fried and I'm like, bro
13370460	13375820	How how how more British can I get? I tried to eat salmon couldn't have it. I don't mind shrimp
13376220	13377500	um
13377500	13383260	Shrimp isn't that bad, but there's not really many things. I have it with a baked potato, but I don't have it with any else
13384220	13389260	Maybe I should try and make a shrimp salad to get more fish in me because fish is like really good for you
13390140	13396140	When it's not full of mercury thanks to humans and dumping things in the water where it doesn't belong
13400300	13402300	Oh good
13404540	13406540	Oh fucking good
13407580	13409580	Almost finished it

13437820	13439820	Okay, you don't need to worry about me
13440460	13442460	I
13443740	13448460	Have the tism and it enables me to do things and that's why I can do all this stuff
13448460	13450460	So don't worry about me. Okay
13450620	13454780	If you mean forgetting to eat and drink that's literally because I'm having such a good time
13455260	13459740	Like streaming and I don't really want to like interrupt that moment for a few moments, you know
13464940	13469020	What a strange pee is it polska? I don't know what it is. I actually don't know what currency that is
13469020	13471980	I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Is it peso weaponized?
13474780	13476780	I know that feeling yes
13476940	13480300	Like I'm just getting something like I'm sure you guys have been lost in the sauce
13480300	13485740	Like if you've ever played a video game and then like you kind of wake out wake up from your trance on the other side
13485820	13489260	You're like, oh my god, I haven't eaten or drank and like a couple of hours type thing
13489260	13491900	Like it's kind of like that with streaming like I just cannot shut up
13492380	13496380	Uh, I love it. I'll have an amazing time with the reflins. Hopefully the content is good
13496380	13501900	I know some people runescape residents sleeper. But look, it's one of my goals. Okay. Once it's once it's done
13501900	13504540	We don't have to come back. Okay. Once it's done
13505500	13510860	And we're doing a watch along and the next one. So we have like a topic of conversation
13510860	13514620	So don't worry about having to like talk and we are going to do the
13515900	13519420	Is it john wick is john wick. We're going to do the john wick series
13520220	13525900	Whilst I do wines in the background and we might do it like that until we get very close to the end
13526540	13531260	And I'll just do one big massive. Yeah, because I kind of saw myself six there. Thank you for coming and remember
13531900	13536300	I appreciate it. I'll try the member ASMR in two days time. Wink wink
13538220	13543500	I'm here for shawty not for the game. What do you mean? You're not here to watch me put wine and water to get
13543740	13545740	Sorry grapes and water together
13546620	13548300	Don't be silly
13548300	13554940	Don't be silly. This is the elusive gameplay that you have always craved your entire life. No vtuber has done it before
13555020	13559980	Yes, a vtuber most likely has done it. Apparently john wick five is in production. That better be a joke
13560060	13562540	I wanted to watch a series that had a finished end
13564380	13568540	Uh, should we watch a different type of series then? What could we watch?
13569100	13571660	What is something that has free free films? That's good
13573580	13577820	Does transformers was there like five transformers or am I making that up?
13580940	13584300	No john wick isn't finished. Oh come on, right
13585180	13587180	Maybe we'll pick something else then
13587660	13591980	I want a start of a story and I want an end of a story. Is that too much to ask for?
13593180	13595180	Because it clearly is
13597820	13601020	Just a a cheeky series spider-man
13605580	13610220	No, I don't think spider-man would do honestly watching story play runescape makes me question getting back into that
13610220	13614460	I'm only concerned with that keeper runescapes that you can pick it up and drop it at any time
13614540	13617100	And like get a feel for like doing the free stuff
13617580	13619900	Like I don't think you need membership to buy wine
13619980	13623580	So if you wanted night night cooking like you can do it whilst like getting items and all that
13624460	13632060	Um kung fu panda if you ignore the force. I've actually not seen the other kung fu pandas. I only saw the first one
13633260	13637500	Maybe we should watch kung fu panda and we just pretend the force doesn't we do not see the four
13637500	13639500	I'm
13639740	13645100	Before we end up nerding out on star wars, but that's about nine installments technically
13646780	13650780	The godfather I've never seen the godfather before it's like a three installments
13654940	13656940	Wow
13659420	13665180	Okay, fruit juice is finished. I am now being nutritionalized in fruit juice with natural sugars
13665180	13668780	And um all the goodness and five a big
13669660	13676140	Vic the victim vitamin that come with my life has become so not sure how many movies apparently that's the golden cap
13676220	13682140	Godfather is so good. I don't care for the godfather. Oh, I'll chance a bit chance a bit. I'm not sure about the godfather. Um,
13682540	13684540	It's a bit well
13685260	13687260	The dark night
13687260	13689260	Is that got free installments?
13689820	13695500	Maybe we do the dark night. I wouldn't mind the dark night with it with Heath Ledger that one
13696540	13699900	Did it finish did he did the Heath Ledger finish the series didn't I?
13705340	13710300	Oh, I do want to watch austin powers. Why please do it before the peeler. Oh, no
13711260	13713260	We have to watch austin power
13715980	13717980	Hmm
13718700	13720700	I've never seen back to the future actually
13723020	13727020	All I know is that his mum wants to bone him when I'm like, oh, this is my kind of pot
13728860	13730540	Oh, who was it?
13730540	13734540	Oh, who goes there identification? Sorry. I'm like, uh, my fork is hitting the ball
13737100	13739820	It passed away are you squinting me right now?
13741340	13746060	I subbed to your patreon to listen to the clapping hands clapping hands
13746380	13750460	I'm just ASMR and I have to say it was a great listen
13750940	13755580	Yeah, I've never heard anything like this in my years of being of tuber. Oh my god
13755580	13761900	I hope you do this again in the future. Yeah, sure. Jeez. Thank you for the 20 jason. I'm glad you enjoyed it
13761900	13767580	Thanks for the support on patreon as well. That's hilarious. I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was just a stupid idea
13768860	13774380	I was like, oh, I can clap without using my hands. So I'll make an ASMR about it like ha ha ha
13775100	13778940	Um, and I just went for it. It was just like a silly idea
13779820	13782060	I'm glad you enjoyed it. That's funny as anything
13786620	13787980	Hmm
13787980	13789420	Okay
13789420	13793660	All my chips are gone. I've eaten chips. I've finished a drink. I'm gonna have a sip of water now
13794860	13797740	Could watch alien if you ignore the force no one likes the force
13798460	13800140	Hmm
13800140	13805420	Yeah, that audio wrecked me. Who lost to the audio admit it right now. I want to know if you lost
13805900	13808300	Can you it's just me jumping up a boom
13816700	13820380	I lost to the audio I lost you lost you nailed
13821660	13823660	Yeah
13823980	13828460	Not beating the alley the alley gunkies about having a dump being veal or
13830060	13832060	I am going to do a big burp
13840940	13844060	This is why I can't eat and be on make at the same time
13845020	13847020	Oh
13852620	13855420	Please tell me someone just taped my dick twitched
13859100	13862300	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
13864300	13871340	Like I just um, I do apologize, but I can't help but that had reverb and everything
13871820	13873340	I
13873340	13878380	Was so fun that one had depth to it. I could feel it coming. I was like, well, that's gonna be a burp
13879500	13880940	Yeah
13880940	13882940	Mukbang ASMR is going to be 30%
13883100	13887980	Oh, maybe I should upload the burp in ASMR is by 2k or should I make it a normal one?
13888140	13892780	No, I posted a normal one for one key. So for the second one, I'm going to put another meme one
13892780	13898540	I have a burp in ASMR that I've already recorded. It's just me drinking coal and water and burping all the way through it
13898780	13902140	And before that gets a warning
13902620	13909100	No, that wouldn't get surely surely someone can burp on youtube.com surely does not get that bad
13910780	13914780	I'll see I'll edit and see if I think it's bad or not because I don't want another warning
13916220	13920940	Uh burping ASMR. Yeah, that's right. We have no manners here. I was raised in a barn
13921820	13925580	I'm just probably gonna get some weird comments. Look as long as you guys are happy. I'm happy
13925820	13931420	I provide the weirdness you indulge in the weirdness. Oh, oh my god. It's my gen name indulge
13931500	13934860	Wow, I wonder why a name does indulge. It's almost like you're to indulge in the girls
13935580	13937580	Crazy concept. All right muffin time
13940460	13942460	You're breathing it's not like
13943340	13948300	So on it. I don't want a burping interest, but you may give me one. Have mercy, please. That's hilarious
13949580	13951340	I remember
13951340	13955580	Someone was like, wait, why are you guys in a burping and they're like imagine
13957180	13961660	She slobs down. She finishes the ink sample and then burps
13963420	13967980	Because uh how hard she was eating the the ink sample
13972700	13974700	I do have mercy in around five hours
13975900	13977900	Uh
13978460	13983900	Did I even hit that properly? Sorry, let me do that again. I do have mercy in five hours
13986860	13988380	Thank you
13988380	13992380	I'll be here for a couple more hours until we read into Zoro so I can take a quick break
13992860	13994940	And then I'll make sure me and mercy can see
13995980	13999580	I even connect to the same game server and before I show you the internet
14003900	14005900	Boo
14008860	14011820	I set her up for that. Thank you. I'll steal it myself. Um
14013580	14017900	The real funny is actually the reeflings and not me. I just yank your jokes and then play that
14020060	14023500	I was thinking of adding a few more sound effects, but I'm not done it yet
14025260	14027260	Ah, my muffin's falling apart
14030780	14032300	Ah
14032300	14034780	I'm almost there. I'm okay. I'm going for muffin
14035580	14039500	Yeah, what's next on the roster of fucking eating?
14045820	14047820	Maybe
14047980	14049820	Maybe one more
14049820	14055020	I need one k more wines and then I've reached my goal as Zoro comes on in three hours. I've got plenty of time
14055340	14057340	What were we even sweating for?
14058700	14060700	Burping is only when
14061180	14064540	It's someone you're attracted to it's the same with the peeler stuff. Ah
14066620	14068620	You know on the golden
14069820	14074700	Uh, I think I might be pushing the upper limits of the AI at the moment
14074700	14077580	So please do excuse me if I drop any conversation. All right, I'll do it
14078620	14079820	um
14079820	14084380	As I said, I literally do not have one piece of content that's limited ads because of um
14085500	14089340	The upper I'm very aware of how the AI works. Um
14091580	14095420	And you know how it can do like live transcriptions or whatever type thing
14095580	14098460	Um, I am able to skirt them one because of my accent
14098460	14103180	Which is fantastic because it cannot for the life of itself figure out my accent for a wee bit
14103420	14106380	However, AI technology is adapting at a incredibly fast rate
14106380	14109260	Which makes me nervous for when it does catch up with the old Scottish accent
14109660	14114460	Um, which is why we're probably going to just become multi-cultural and just have like a billion different
14115100	14117100	things
14118060	14120060	Uh, Scottish accent doesn't count
14120060	14123660	Hey, literally if you ever look at the closed captions on my streams
14123660	14127340	Like especially when I go super scots like I'm mucking about with that accent or whatever
14127340	14131420	It it doesn't have an it does not even comprehend one earth. I'm trying to say
14132460	14136220	I don't understand it. Um, which I think helps me with all my
14136780	14140620	Skirting of the the conversations we may or may not be having
14147660	14149660	Mm-hmm
14149980	14151980	Okay, I've had some water
14152300	14156060	Yeah, in general it happens wherever AI fears the scots. Can you understand us?
14156780	14162700	Scottish accent is an enigma to the human brain as well. So I think you're safer a bit until you all become scots with me
14162940	14164300	so
14164300	14170460	All right, I'm gonna finally open up this bag of raisins. So I commit to eating some of them because I've had them for how long
14171740	14173740	Oh, jeez I can't oh, it's
14174540	14176540	Oh, okay, we're in we're in
14177980	14179980	Oh that smell rather
14180140	14182140	My smell of smell smells delicious
14183580	14188860	All right, let's who wants a chocolate covered raisin and please don't make fun of me for liking chocolate covered raisins
14188940	14191820	I really like chocolate covered raisins. Okay. They're a nice snack
14192380	14194380	um
14194940	14196940	Oh, no, there's shit
14197900	14199900	I spent so much money on the
14200620	14202620	really shit
14204460	14210540	No, this can't be I spent so much money on it. Can you be shite? I'm not loving it to be shite
14212620	14215580	Yeah, the reason reasons are nice. You guys don't like raisins
14220140	14221900	Oh
14221900	14228780	I'll tell you something that might filter you from me. I like oat and raisin cookies. I actually think they're the bee's knees
14230060	14233660	You get a nice buttery oate cookie. It's delicious
14234700	14237740	You get filtered get filtered get filtered
14240300	14243180	I think they're nice. You get a nice buttery homemade one. They're so good
14247660	14249660	Hmm
14252460	14258140	I think some variant of scots was used in world war two for announcements so the germans couldn't keep up
14258300	14261500	That's hilarious. You know that you've no been talking on this. Have you?
14264300	14270220	Those aren't rabies raisins she be was over earlier. Oh my god. This is like completely off topic
14271420	14273820	I think I've said this before maybe I haven't
14275260	14279420	When I was a child I used to poop like rabbit poop
14280460	14282460	And you may be like what?
14282540	14286540	Yeah, and my my little poopies look like little rabbit poops
14286700	14291580	I don't know what the heck was wrong with me as a child, but I just thought you should know that fun fact
14294140	14296540	And now you know you're cursed with the knowledge
14297260	14298780	um
14298780	14300780	I don't know what it means
14301020	14303740	Actually, you know what let's google it. We're in the
14304620	14306620	We're in the age of technology
14307420	14313340	Um, let's google it. Why do my I look like rabbit
14313340	14315340	Um
14318220	14323740	Signs of a low fiber diet. Wow. I had no fiber as a child. Am I surprised? No, um
14324860	14327180	No, I am not surprised I had any fiber as a child
14328060	14329420	um
14329420	14335020	I was a bottomless pit as a child. Um, I've been very lucky
14336380	14339740	And was blessed with the skinny milinky long legs gene
14340220	14343420	Um, but I put it to good use by giving myself a returned butt
14344220	14346220	You have no fiber now
14347420	14350060	Google's gonna say it's claude or something
14351420	14354940	I substituted that word. I know what word you did use but the mall is funny
14356620	14358620	Um
14358700	14360700	Wait, are you a rabbit in real life? Yeah
14361420	14365900	You are not a cull. You are here. I remember it took me so long
14365980	14369100	I was like, why on earth did she be called a fan base hero? I don't get it
14370060	14372060	um
14374780	14376780	I could get it. I don't understand
14381660	14385980	Hmm this is a shit cup of tea. I can tell you that much
14388700	14394460	I'm definitely adequately fed and warred though. I don't even need the nature valley bar. I don't even need it
14396460	14398460	Um
14400700	14406300	Okay, thank you for allowing me to do the one of the nastiest burps I've done so far on stream
14406540	14413340	Um, and rehydrate and refueling. I no longer feel lightheaded. So we're we're doing good. Thank you for
14414540	14419900	Putting up with me. I know some people don't like eating sounds. Uh, do apologize if that is not your hang
14420380	14421900	um
14421900	14428460	And I completely look at different strokes different folks. Okay different tickles of pickles and all that jazz. You know how it works
14430620	14431980	Who's that?
14431980	14435180	You can do better. I trust you. I don't know if I could freaking out do that
14435740	14439500	The the biggest burps I have is when I eat because I get trapped wind as a swallow
14440380	14445100	Thanks for the stream mom my fish. Good luck when meeting. Bye. Bye. We eat me getting ready for stream
14445740	14448620	Yeah, you're getting ready for stream. We eat me. I bet you are
14453260	14455260	Strokes and pickles cool knowledge of you
14455900	14459420	I'm okay with your burps. You're conditioning me towards it. That's terrible
14460860	14464620	I prefer the aid burping so disgusting this entire agency burps. Yeah, okay
14465260	14467740	You don't burp. You don't burp when you're at home. Chief
14468220	14471020	You have to remember we sit in our bedrooms memeing on games
14471740	14473820	But what makes you think we're uncomfortable here?
14474700	14477260	From around these parts we burp with our mouth wide open
14478220	14482460	I don't know where you're from where you're all you all got your your little uh manners
14482780	14488380	You got manners and stuff chief get your manners out of here. They did you know manners are set and I'm just
14490220	14493180	Burping makes you real you need to more spinach or whole grains and
14493580	14497820	General also I found out during the mid-diet granola bars are terrible for nutrition
14498300	14499820	Oh, are they?
14499820	14504620	I freaking bought some for stream for when I do endurance days with I can't like I can't make foods
14506540	14508540	That food literally
14509020	14511180	Did you know AI so advanced I can make music now
14511820	14515820	It was only a matter of time. Oh, there will be there will be a song made out of only my burps
14516540	14521020	I actually so obviously in the day and age of AI technology
14522060	14529500	Um, obviously it is a very hard field to navigate because of the implications of how many jobs it can take and how many
14530060	14532060	livelihoods it um affects
14532540	14533820	um
14533820	14536860	And I am no exception. Um, you know
14537820	14545740	If you want to be like mega serious the biggest example of like AI taking your jobs as v-tubers
14545820	14548540	There's none other than uh neurosama
14549180	14557180	And people like thousands of people watching AI to stream. Um, it's quite it's really magnificent if you look into it
14557180	14559180	It really is um
14559180	14562860	But like it obviously, you know artists, you know artists any like it
14562940	14567420	I mean freaking hell me for example, like I didn't really want you to feed my voice
14568300	14575820	And then I did consider possibly AI singing of my voice because I cannot sing um due to
14576860	14584220	Um vocal damage. Uh, unfortunately, I've damaged my vocal cords successfully. Um in all my journeys that I
14586780	14589100	I can't sing the way others can sing, you know
14589180	14592940	Um, if you didn't know you can't actually train yourself to sing over time
14593180	14598060	But I have like perma damaged myself and I've nerfed myself basically
14598780	14603180	So I did think I did think like would AI song be
14604140	14608700	Acceptable in that instance because I can't produce what the song is but I can feed
14609500	14615100	An algorithm my voice to make that song and then it makes it sound like I'm singing type thing. Um
14615340	14616540	Um
14616540	14618060	But then I'm like
14618060	14624060	No, because that's kind of like it's it's a very interesting like morals are coming into economies coming into it
14624460	14630300	Everyone's got a wee piece and a wee side thing. Um, and it's very curious. I'm I'm interested to see where it's gonna go
14630780	14636940	It's very nerve-wracking as a content creator. However, um, because um
14640140	14643900	Content creation basically relies on
14645740	14648540	People to fund it. Um
14649500	14654460	type thing like obviously I'm a bit different because I'm already like self-funded if that makes sense. Um
14656700	14663340	But like if people were to like just straight up stop supporting and being like well this AI posts it for free exactly what I'm looking for
14663420	14665180	It's like these are real people
14665180	14672060	But then you could start to argue like well that happens with any sort of medium like if there's a better competitor that comes up
14672060	14675260	Well, yeah, they've lost out on their business and their pension and their business shuts down
14675500	14677500	That's just the way it is in this market
14678140	14679100	um
14679100	14681580	So it's kind of hard to even get into a real
14682380	14688220	Mitty bit of whatever the conversation might be when it comes to AI because there's so many nuances that can come up
14688540	14692380	But these nuances are valid in the conversation topic. Um
14693100	14698380	It's a double edged sword really it can help smaller game studios or indies produce games faster
14698700	14703500	On the other hand it can put others out of business. Yes, the creative field
14704140	14706140	it it's very
14707340	14713260	Obviously we're kind of aware about the sinister nature of what AI has been up to recently with creating um
14714220	14718620	fakes which is a shame because I don't think anyone should be subjected to that. Um
14719820	14723020	You know, I'm I mean obviously as a creator
14723980	14727340	I mean I have a bias and I'm like if no one wants that stuff out there
14727340	14731020	Don't put it out there if they delete it then let it be deleted type thing
14731660	14735340	Um, but that's just my two cents. Um, but I
14735980	14742220	I'm aware that on the other side of a viewer being like this person provided me a lot of comfort these videos provided me a lot of comfort
14742940	14745020	and
14745020	14749340	Yeah, the world ends when AI can write software that actually functions at a high level without tweaking
14749740	14751740	I'm about to tweak it
14751900	14759020	Uh, I can burp in without holding my hand in front of me. I got hit too much on the back of my head when I was young from
14759500	14761500	Oh, sorry. You got whacked as a child
14762300	14764300	That's not good
14764700	14770300	Did you know it actually throws your nervous system out if you get whacked as a child for correction reasons
14770940	14774940	Content creation is enjoyed for the creator's personality or knowledge. So I doubt AI
14775340	14780540	Well, see you say that but then my counter argument is Neurosama right now
14781980	14783980	Thousands of people watching
14784940	14788060	Algorithm essentially a machine learning algorithm
14788700	14790220	um
14790220	14792220	It's fascinating. It's really fascinating
14792700	14795340	It is and obviously, you know, you can be like
14795900	14799980	Oh, you're just to be here. You're mad because bought it bought doing better than you and it's like no
14799980	14802780	I'm trying to I'm trying to explain the side of like
14803580	14806140	This is a a machine
14807660	14809660	That has been programmed
14810620	14815740	Blade blade runner blade runner there there. That's how I'll connect the dots blade runner
14816460	14818460	How about that?
14818540	14820540	you know
14820780	14822780	I think AI is an inevitable
14822780	14823980	It needs
14823980	14829500	It's very it's probably what I think is going to happen with AI is it's going to explode
14829660	14836700	Everyone has access to it. Then laws and regulations catch up to the explosion, but the damage will already have been done
14836940	14838460	I think
14838460	14845660	That is what's going to happen my the reasoning. I think it is a blow up and then catch up but damage is done
14846940	14848700	YouTube
14848700	14851660	In the internet as a whole starting off as baby
14852620	14859820	Everyone is catching up to what in real life laws there are because the internet and in real life are two different things
14859820	14861820	I think we can all agree on that
14862220	14865980	And a reflection of this is the current ongoing
14866700	14867820	card
14867820	14871100	Sorry, my throat was burping card payment processors
14872060	14874060	They are actually
14874780	14877500	catching up to almost in real life
14878460	14880220	laws and things
14880220	14886460	And it's not treating the internet differently. So one of the biggest examples right now is patreon is no longer allowing
14887340	14889340	um
14890060	14892780	artwork that depicts um
14894460	14897100	Any possibility of cnc
14897740	14900780	Even though the artworks are artworks and not real people
14901500	14907820	But that's because mastercard is bending their arm behind their back because of in real life laws
14907980	14912220	Like the internet is being caught up to in real life laws. Does that make sense?
14912300	14913740	Hopefully that makes sense
14913740	14920780	Doesn't the people watch uh dj and stuff like pranksters you use an ai to enhance your content wouldn't be that bad in the grand scheme of
14921900	14928380	Yes, but I didn't what what what makes me hold back from aiing my voice to do song covers is
14929020	14931660	One it loses its charm because it's not my croaky voice
14932380	14933260	two
14933340	14942300	It's it's not a statement of endorsement. No, however, I think it's definitely a like, uh, that's a shame she uses ai
14943420	14945420	cncio
14945660	14946860	content
14946860	14948860	uh con con
14949500	14952620	Is what cnc is someone someone type I can't type what it is what you
14953420	14958940	Laws become uh antiquated fast even when they do come out. Yes, it's um very interesting to see how the
14959420	14966460	Interwebs are being navigated at this moment in time. Oh, I lost it because I was reading we got 72 000 pop. That was fantastic
14967820	14969100	um
14969100	14970460	Yeah, it's a
14970460	14975180	I like the deep diving in the convo is like this. I know like people like shout out shout away
14975260	14979820	Oh, I don't want to get into it. I don't want to get into it. I want to get in a I want to see what your thoughts are
14979820	14984060	I want to tell you what my current thoughts are you might change my mind. We might come to a different thing
14984060	14987260	We may talk about this. I don't mind talking about these things
14987660	14992300	I think it's nice. I think it's refreshing being able to talk about it. But I mean, that's for me
14993180	14995260	Fake version of that. I am she's making winds with
14998620	15000620	I don't I can't even translate that
15001980	15003980	but yes, um
15004060	15006060	l'ma the least ethical players are
15006860	15010220	Are stealing their data. Yeah, I think a france
15010700	15011900	um
15011900	15018140	A french like art school got done for using AI and it was like the most ironic moronic thing and everyone was like, bro
15019580	15026060	The AI conversation goes into politics easily. It's because the laws need to actually catch up, which I think maybe
15026460	15028460	um, why?
15029260	15031260	Probably leaks into that a lot
15032380	15034380	But anyway, what do I know? I'm just
15034780	15039740	Uh, a cuttlefish that wants to drown all of humanity to he what happens if it wasn't humanity
15040220	15045260	Oh, sorry, someone wants to trade my apologies. Hold on. Let me make space. Hold on. Let me just connect these winds
15045740	15048300	What's going on here? What's going on here? Right? What's going on here?
15048940	15052380	Oh, you give me a what wait? Why is that worth 15k for that one wine?
15053500	15054460	What is
15054460	15056460	half full wine jug
15057340	15061820	What wait, can I half drink? Why is that so much money? Am I going crazy?
15064300	15066300	Wine of jug four
15067100	15069100	Oh
15069500	15072060	Half wine jug 18k
15073340	15075340	Infinite moneymaker glitch
15076140	15080300	Question mark. Can I like half drink these wines and make like a stupendous amount of money?
15083420	15085420	Um
15086060	15088060	Am I going crazy?
15088380	15094620	Half wine. Why how do I get half a wine? Can you drink used drug used jug? Sorry
15094940	15099020	No, dang it. Wait, how do you do half?
15101020	15103020	What that's bizarre
15103660	15105660	What is it?
15105820	15111100	How do you get half you have 25 million? Why do you need look we're here to be billionaires so we can
15111820	15116140	bribe the politicians to put in stuff that's actually against it for our interests
15117260	15123740	It's a rare item that comes with events. How bizarre. Okay. It's the same reason burnt fish sells for something. Oh, I guess
15124620	15129580	Well, it's main. No, thank you. Or do you want the wine back? You're allowed to have it back. By the way, you can just ask
15130860	15133420	I'm not actually going to keep it. I'm just surprised. I didn't understand
15135900	15139420	A brave politician. Oh as long as it interests their bank account
15140460	15146140	And uh, you can pretty much pass whatever you want. As long as you got the the funds to cough up
15148140	15152940	Which is why velour is going to be a billion dollar enterprise so we can change the world
15153020	15157980	I'm just kidding. We are just anime girls on the internet. We're looking for some ink. Okay
15159420	15161420	Yeah, it's called lobbying. Yeah
15162060	15165820	And not the good kind of cod lobbies the bad kind of cod lobbies
15166700	15171980	Back in my day wine used to be drunk in two gulps leaving behind the half wine after
15172780	15174060	We're getting old
15174060	15179340	We're getting oh, sorry. Just put that momentary again. We're getting og old scoop lore
15179580	15183340	Geez, can I finish the sense right? I'll finish this cup of tea before I finish my next sense
15185100	15187100	Vealers already changed me for sure

15258220	15262140	There's no one seeing anything mean at all. I'm just arguing with potential
15262380	15265420	Arguers. I'm absolutely losing it. I'm so sorry reef lens

15277180	15279180	Oh, no, that's such an
15279260	15283820	Unmeaned thought I don't like that idea on my head. She's arguing my ghost

15288460	15290460	Arguing with the voices
15290860	15294220	She's arguing with the restless spirit of her toenail rip toenail
15295420	15297100	It's um
15297100	15303580	Not as bad as I I thought I I pushed I I would I would confess my sin
15304460	15307340	I pushed through the bandage to see what I'd feel
15308540	15310140	um
15310140	15313500	I'm not gonna push it for a while because one that hurt uh ow
15313820	15314780	and two
15314780	15316780	Ow and three
15317260	15322540	I don't I couldn't really tell what I feel. I think it just feels like touching a normal flesh really
15324620	15326620	And
15327340	15330140	But yeah, definitely not touching it again for a while because that's done
15330540	15333420	I'm on basic painkillers now. Um, it's it's not
15334540	15337660	It's really no that bad. It's really no that bad. Um
15338140	15339340	Um
15339340	15343500	It's probably just gonna be a patience thing now. Um, because it takes forever to heal
15343500	15347580	Actually, I should go out in the garden and get some sunlight and me to help heal it off, but
15348780	15350780	I want to play rinse
15350940	15353660	And then I want to play goose game with mercy
15357500	15359500	You can take your frustrations out on us
15360060	15365100	Strenuous myths online that all visitors have a voice in their head. I can like argue with myself
15365180	15369340	I'm not even being funny. I can just straight up start having arguments with myself about stuff
15369660	15373900	Like that's why I like when I do actually go like off the rails on my wee rants a little bit
15374140	15378220	It's because I'm in my head. I'm talking to someone that doesn't believe it
15379180	15383980	And I have to explain it from the start like as if you were an alien and you've never heard about this before
15384220	15388540	And I'm like and that's why I'm always like and another thing and another part of this like, yeah
15389340	15393900	Your britain d levels are probably in the gut. No, the sun is too dangerous for me
15394060	15396060	I need to go back to pale scotland
15397020	15401900	Um, I'm actually in danger of the sun if you didn't know, um skin cancer in
15402540	15404540	Australia is no joke. We
15405020	15406700	We uh, hung
15406700	15410620	Oh, wait, I don't think you're not let's say that terminology. My apologies. Don't don't mean to offend
15411100	15418140	We pasty white ghosts are actually not really supposed to be on Australia because uh, we are not suited for the sun
15418780	15420780	The sun's rays are extra strong
15420860	15422300	Um
15422300	15428780	And uh, yeah, isn't it winter there? It is but the sun is still very strong. It doesn't matter
15431580	15435340	The uv rays just because it's cold it's still there. Oh my god. My freaking tea is cold
15437900	15441900	Because I can't stop talking I don't think I've had a warm cup of tea in weeks
15441900	15443900	Oh
15452060	15454060	Ozzie and kiwi bro suffering from the sun
15455420	15457420	Yeah
15457900	15461340	Half Aussie half Scottish will you actually no no no full scots
15465260	15468380	If you ever want to run a business and you can pick between scotland and
15468940	15471580	Australia do it in Australia you get to keep more of your money
15472620	15476220	And then go back to scotland. I mean I'm going back to Scotland
15480060	15486220	I I my my pasty white people need me um, and we're having the refund farm in scotland anyway, so
15487260	15488860	Yeah, it's uh
15488860	15494460	Don't get me wrong Australia beautiful country. Love it. Love the sun. Love my chinese auntie
15494780	15497580	Love my granny. I love all these people
15498380	15505580	But I am not suited for this country. I am I am too used to the most oppressive ways of the uk. I really am
15506460	15512140	Got a brew of tea forget about it microwave it then. Uh, do not ever suggest microwaving a tea in my presence
15512460	15515500	You have to start are we raising shape?
15516620	15519740	The farm needs eggs because we need protein
15521100	15523100	um
15523260	15524940	I don't
15524940	15526060	want
15526060	15528860	I think we just need eggs on the farm reflands
15529740	15531420	and then we can have like
15531420	15536620	I can make like scrambled egg pepper like from peppers and we grew in the garden
15537500	15542140	And then that can be our wee breakfast and then lunch can be a wee sangha
15543740	15546220	Would we have wheat production and flour?
15547260	15549420	Would we have a flour mill on the farm?
15550060	15553340	Thousands of chickens to feed us. I think we need like eight
15553980	15557100	Hens lay us and and say I did my research on chickens
15557500	15562700	I actually did my research while I was away on holiday wink wink um for a year. Uh
15563900	15566460	So chickens lay eggs for
15567020	15572700	One to five years and then they are considered an elderly chicken and no longer lay
15572860	15575980	Most people just perish the chicken when it stops laying
15576380	15581020	I couldn't do that if a chicken has given me eggs for five years and it stops
15581100	15584780	I am not going to perish it because it can no longer do it. I want it to live
15584860	15589900	It's happy little chicken life in the garden. Okay, like um, some people are brutal with their way
15589980	15595020	Uh, their wings their chickens. I said, I guess the chickens are our wings roofland. Um
15597820	15601900	But yeah, I they like can lay a lot
15602860	15606780	There's also the possibility that we would need
15607500	15613500	Ducks on the farm because ducks are natural pest control for slugs and stuff
15614060	15616860	So for because I I want to go like natural
15617100	15621020	I don't want to use like harsh chemicals or anything to like grow production wise like
15621580	15624620	Um fertilizers all that stuff that's bad for the environment
15625420	15629260	Um, but ducks and chicken are fantastic for getting bugs and stuff
15629260	15635500	But the chicken could not be allowed near the crop harvest because chickens will destroy the crops
15635740	15641100	However, ducks do not destroy the crops. Um, only chickens destroy absolutely everything
15641500	15645980	They can pot their little beaks can get on because they are
15647260	15649260	Destructors they also
15649260	15651500	Stir up stir up the soil
15651580	15657420	So if we need natural fertilizer, you can like just straight up scoop it and shove it on a plant bed
15657980	15659980	Then it's pretty good
15660060	15662380	Your chicken was eaten by weasels weasels
15663420	15668940	Aren't weasels small aquatic animals that are like long like a noodle
15670860	15673180	A weasel are weasels, but what?
15674300	15676300	A weasel weasel
15677900	15682940	A little small on aqua a weasel yoink your chicken isn't the chicken bigger than the
15684380	15686380	Weasels are land based
15687660	15689660	Oh looks like a little noodle
15691980	15693980	That yoink to chicken
15694460	15696940	That thing can take down a chicken. It's tiny
15698540	15701180	Hold on. Let me pull up the picture. I'm looking at right now
15703900	15707500	Uh, they look toy they look like a pet
15709740	15715740	If I can pull up a picture anytime now, right hold on. Let's let's go be cheeky picture in
15718220	15720220	Hmm
15720620	15722620	This is what I see
15724060	15727820	This yoink to chicken this that yoink to chicken
15729420	15731420	It's tiny
15731900	15733900	Unless they're like a lot bigger than I imagine
15736460	15742140	Weasels are deadly shut up. These are deadly animals. Look at the freaking look a cutie looks
15743100	15748860	I've been trolled humans can yoink ostriches. Oh, well you do actually have a point there hold on a minute
15748940	15751580	Hold on that reefland speaking the truth. Hold on pause
15755820	15757820	Okay
15761820	15763820	They're cute till they open their mouths
15765660	15767660	Is that like me a matty?
15767740	15769340	Yeah
15769340	15771340	Okay, maybe if it's like me a matty
15772780	15778300	They look like ferrets. That's not a thought. Do you read the red wall series? There's a reason weasels are the villains in it
15778300	15780700	No, I haven't read that actually. I don't know what it is
15782540	15785260	I don't know what red wall is but that's okay
15787020	15788460	Because I
15788460	15793420	Means I can experience media that you guys enjoy. No, you're cute even after opening your mouth
15793420	15795420	Hmm
15796780	15803500	Rod red wall was game of thrones for kids. That is hilarious as a description
15804140	15806140	um
15806300	15811660	Is there a cat in here or am I losing it? No, it's the heating. Sorry the heating's come on and it's moving the blind
15811660	15815580	And it makes me think that Vigo is on the window, but he's not
15817580	15820780	And before a cat jumps up on the table and I get heart attack of a lifetime
15821340	15823340	It's trying to you're cute when you open your dash straight
15824700	15826220	You're not
15826220	15828460	No, you're cute, especially when your mouth is open
15830300	15832300	Good
15832300	15834300	That's the way I like it
15837980	15841420	But yes, uh, I will try my best to
15842060	15847340	Actually properly update my youtube because now it looks all terribly wrong
15848220	15855900	But it's going to be bulk troll for two hours spout roll. Sorry for two hours. And then it's going to be
15857820	15861340	Um member stream for two hours and then that's a four hour day
15861500	15865420	Which means I might actually have the energy to edit and do all the things I need to do
15867260	15869260	um
15869740	15871740	I liked moss flower a lot
15871820	15876540	In moss flower there was an evil cat who had a bunch of mercenaries who taxed the forest animals and then
15877420	15879420	Other folk went and killed them
15880220	15882860	I should actually is robin hood
15884380	15886380	This is going to sound so silly
15887500	15893180	And if it is silly, it's okay. You can laugh is robin hood like um actually based on a novel that
15893740	15895740	and not just that disney tv show
15897100	15898780	um
15898780	15900780	Because if so
15900860	15902860	I'm here for robin hood not gonna lie
15903660	15909340	He actually kind of he had a few good points, you know take from the rich that I'll never even notice that that's gone
15910220	15912220	It is okay. Maybe we should read that
15913180	15916460	Would you replace hypnotica? There's a cuttlefish in the game. Oh
15917740	15919820	I might give it a cheeky shot. Um
15921980	15926380	I don't know how hard should I play the game blind or should I look up
15927020	15927820	gameplay
15927820	15930620	So I am not completely clueless
15931020	15937180	Because the reason I can play velcro on stream confidently is because I've seen someone play it play it blind
15937420	15939820	Play it blind blind. It's fine. Okay. I'll trust you
15940780	15942780	um
15943020	15947420	I will stick it near the end of july for subnautica
15948140	15950140	How about that deal?
15950140	15953820	Near the end of july we'll do a subnautica. I'll do it blind and
15954780	15959260	We'll see if my fish friends are going to be nice to me at all robin hood is not based on novel
15959260	15962380	He's a legendary figure in folk folk lore
15963020	15967180	The early stories about him dating back to 14th century were shared through oral traditions
15968220	15970220	I'm gonna share some oral traditions with me
15972860	15976620	Look I had to think about it on the spot. I couldn't change the sentence up that much
15976700	15979100	I mean I kind of lose its potency, you know
15980140	15982700	Oh, well, I will I try
15984780	15986780	Hmm
15989740	15994940	Well the character is in public domain is there a robin hood video game are you thinking that
15996380	15999340	Robin Hood, but it's a girl the classic twist
15999980	16002780	And then people get annoyed because it's gender changed
16002780	16008220	But actually it just brings more publicity and yet again we have fallen for the bruce of the marketing campaign
16010380	16012380	We can't escape it
16012780	16014780	Fools I tell you fills we are
16017260	16021020	Yeah, I'm sure you're skilled in oral traditions. Yeah, I want to find out
16022700	16024700	I think I'm doing
16026780	16028780	I can't remember what me fucking
16029900	16032300	Audio supposed to be that comes out tomorrow
16034220	16039260	I can't believe I'm actually gonna have to wake up an hour early for stream so I can edit that and get it all ready to
16039660	16043020	Publish because I've not edited it yet because I'm a naughty naughty
16047740	16051820	Are we talking about that and fire entire fate franchise fate
16053580	16063100	Oh my gosh, we're in the 49,000s. We're no longer in the 50,000. Let's go Omri five. Let's go. Sorry. I timed out because I was reading
16063340	16064860	Hey
16064860	16071900	Congratulations, you just advanced the cooking level. You just advanced our cooking level your cooking level is 85. Let's
16072780	16074780	Go. This was my goal
16075180	16079580	for today's stream and we did it. I wanted 85
16082620	16084940	I'd be self plenty of time for Azor to come along
16085660	16087900	You're now a quarter of the weight in a night. Don't
16088860	16091260	see such heinous things in my presence
16092220	16093660	I am
16093660	16097180	Look, if there's any doubters, I'm gonna be honest. I'm doubting a little bit
16097660	16102060	We'll see what happens by the end of the movie marathons
16103420	16105420	and
16105420	16109020	If the movie marathons are fine, we'll see where we are
16110140	16113660	But you're making me nervous saying that I'm only one fourth of a way there
16114300	16117260	I'm getting a bit shaky and not the good kind because I'm like
16117980	16119340	bruh
16119340	16121340	This is insane endurance
16122300	16124300	I'm not sure like if
16125100	16128380	If I finish this batch of 49,000, right?
16130300	16132700	Surely that's my 99, right?
16136060	16140700	That's 99 if I finish these wine. Yes, you'll be done. Okay
16142220	16146140	Okay, I have faith because we started at 53,000
16147100	16150540	And we're already in 49 so I have a bit more faith now
16152140	16158940	I'm getting my resolve tested roughly 48,000 needs to be done. Right. Okay. If it's 48,000
16159580	16161820	I can I can do it. Okay
16163260	16164780	Give me one
16164780	16170460	Endurance stream where we watch video games where we watch movies whilst we do this then I think we can do it
16170460	16173740	I don't know. Maybe there'll be two back-to-back like movie streams
16174460	16179340	Just so I don't have to think and I could be like, uh, grape goes in water jug
16181340	16183740	Movie on the bunga basically
16184860	16186540	um
16186540	16189660	For meme ASMR just read the wiki page on the kingdoms of scotland
16191260	16195980	Yes, I am going to do a movie watch along the next time we play runescape
16195980	16201340	So I don't have to think basically and we'll see how much we clear in one of those streams
16201740	16206220	And we can just enjoy the movies for what they're worth copyright laws. Oh, no, no, no, no, no
16206620	16209500	You do not know how we do watch alongs in this house
16211740	16217900	We have a timestamp and you're gonna see where we are, but we do not get copyrighted in this house. I assure you
16220300	16226220	You'll just have to show up to the runescape stream to see what dastardly plans I have in order to do a watch along
16226540	16228540	Hmm
16228860	16232300	Blade runner or alien watch along strongly expected us to be mine
16232380	16237660	Little didn't know it's gonna be me. That's mine broken by the end of this honestly. I thought 99 cooking was easy
16238300	16243340	I'm sorry. I actually genuinely thought it was easy. I take it back. I take it all back. It's not easy. Oh, I hate this
16243820	16245500	Well, I don't hate it
16245500	16247500	I just I'm like
16247500	16252940	Feeling a bit overwhelmed because I'm like, oh my god. This is actually going to I can't believe it
16253260	16258940	I can't believe this achievement in runescape takes a while that barely any players have actually achieved
16260220	16262860	It's a free 99. Is that why it takes so long?
16263660	16267180	And before we could like swap to fletching and get it done when the day
16268540	16269900	That would uh
16269900	16274780	Actually be pretty hilarious. Just be like, all right. We'll do 99 fletch and write runescape series over when we got a 99
16274860	16278140	I'll take it. Cooking actually is one of the most common feels good, man
16279100	16282860	See everyone just wants to know how go do agility 99. Absolutely not
16283580	16289180	I don't know much about agility, but absolutely not. I know for a fact that's a nightmare one. I think
16290700	16293180	Is it rune crafting is a nightmare one as well?
16295500	16296940	I think
16296940	16298940	thieving if I recall correctly
16299580	16307420	Thieving is you pickpocket some guard from level 72 onwards. You just do the exact same thing for ages
16308140	16313020	I cannot believe this is what prime runescape gameplay is. I'm so sorry, but it actually is as well
16313020	16315020	Like it doesn't get better than this
16315260	16320460	It doesn't get better than looking into your inventory pulling stuff out putting it back in again
16321260	16323580	Mining is actually pretty bad. Hmm
16325580	16329980	Is wood cutting the only one that you can like actually or is it sand crabs?
16330060	16333500	Is it sand crabs you can afk like you're attacking damage on?
16334140	16337980	But you still do need to be on standby or something. I can't remember
16338380	16343100	I don't think there's any true afk like unless you count like hitting a tree
16343820	16345100	afk
16345100	16347100	um, I don't know
16347100	16349580	You can afk the knight in combat easy. Oh
16351580	16355740	Peak gaming, uh, I prefer pyramid plunder to arby knights, but each of their own
16356460	16358220	ardy knights
16358220	16360220	You can do alchemy
16363500	16364700	I
16364700	16371180	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think maybe once we hit 99 runescape. I'm definitely taking a big break from it
16371260	16375980	I do genuinely thoroughly enjoy the game. I wouldn't mind doing questing again
16376060	16378540	I actually thoroughly enjoyed doing the quest with everyone
16379100	16380060	and
16380060	16385500	I do not have much experience with the quest and plots so I wouldn't mind doing it like um
16386220	16391580	At some point, but I'm talking like this is probably august if we're gonna if we're gonna runescape 99 this
16392060	16394460	It's probably august until the next runescape
16395420	16397420	content comes out because
16397900	16400380	It's um, although the questing would be fun
16401020	16405820	You gotta go members request. The real question is without help at what point should we be, you know
16407100	16410700	If you didn't have help and did like if you
16413180	16417340	And you did like barbarians like salmon maybe if you did salmon
16417340	16419340	I
16419740	16422220	Mean if he did it whilst I was like streaming other games
16422380	16428300	You probably would be near the same level if not farther than me because I've just been grinding on other games
16428380	16430380	baby
16435820	16438860	I have grown so sleepy after eating all that food
16439980	16443500	I'm like man. I could really use a nap before this collab. I don't I don't want to
16444460	16448380	I don't want to I want to put make more progress towards my level
16450060	16453500	But then again if we're doing like 12 or a shift to watch movies then
16454460	16456620	It's not even a shift. Let's be honest
16457420	16462860	What did you do for your work today? I did backbreaking work stacking shelves was doing the chill
16463260	16466700	The tells had to like clean up like spillages and all that. What did you do?
16467100	16472140	Oh, I watched movies while leveling up on old school runescape. Oh
16473100	16476300	Like come on come on mate. Get real
16477740	16484300	New runescape is like 10 times easier, but the levels are go up to 120. Do they not which is like four times 99
16485900	16487900	Unless I'm misunderstanding
16488860	16491980	Well, you already reached your goal for today. Do you want us to tempt you to sleep?
16491980	16497500	Don't because I think I might actually take a nap. I'm like, well if I need to be full strength for
16498380	16505900	Mercy's collab. I'm like if I go how about if I take it to nine o'clock is she be gonna be on at nine or she be on now?
16507980	16512860	Oh, I don't want to I don't want to um be a silly billy
16516620	16518780	Naps kind of ruined my sleep she'd be live now
16518780	16524220	I know she's like, but she's gonna be alive for like another 30 minutes if I round it up to nine a.m
16524220	16529900	Which makes no sense for anyone not in my time zone if I round it up for another 25 minutes ish
16531900	16533100	Um
16533100	16538220	The modern version of the game you get a million xp an hour in the slayer skill and you can get like maybe 50 k an hour on here
16538220	16540220	Oh, wow
16540300	16542300	You are not messing around
16544140	16546140	You can sleep am I ask she be
16547100	16549100	Yeah, can um
16549420	16554060	Can someone be very kind and bump into she be streaming just say
16554620	16559580	Strongly wants to redirect to you in 20 minutes. Will you still be on question mark?
16560540	16563820	Uh, I will appreciate it if you notice someone else has already typed that message
16563900	16568300	Please don't spam or chat too much because I don't know. I don't know how in sync the reeflings are yet
16568380	16574460	I mean you guys are actually pretty in sync. You think you think that yesterday, which means pretty entertaining
16576700	16578700	Uh, yes
16580300	16586540	I am very tempted for a nap. I've eaten all that food and I'm like I'm unironically barely full of mead and
16587180	16592940	Like getting sleepy. This happened last time I played runescape. I think this is just such a like peaceful relaxing game
16593820	16595820	It looks like she's just chatting. She's
16596700	16598700	She said to late pee don't know
16599500	16601500	Give her a pee don't
16602460	16606460	So I can redirect into her in 20 minutes. She says probably till late. What's that mean?
16609100	16611100	Yes, or no she be a young in 20 minutes
16611980	16613260	Yes, I know
16613260	16620060	Tell me she be right. I'll take that as a yes. I'll just make sure I redirect and then I'm going for a nap
16623100	16627820	And where are you? Oh, Amy's playing with her palace at the level
16628780	16634140	Hopefully she's having a good stream together with her. I need to learn her name out of respect
16635500	16641900	I'm such a forgetful. Well, she hasn't even started the game yet. Oh, she's not even started. Oh, okay. That's hilarious
16641900	16650380	Yeah, I'll it's safe to redirect into sheepsters. Um, right. We will do our 20 more minutes of wines
16651100	16654060	and then I'm going to be a cheeky sod and go for a nap and
16654300	16655420	uh
16655420	16659020	Wake up. Maybe I can edit an ASMR in time. Um
16659820	16665580	But my eye, I kid you not my eyes are like, um, yeah sleep sleep. I love sleep. That's a yappy dome
16666620	16670620	It's very easy and at 90 if you do members trees, you can afk for like 20 minutes at a time
16670620	16672620	Tastes like two weeks more though. Ah, okay
16673900	16675900	It's afk though, it's good
16677020	16682700	Oh, I need to pee pee because I actually put liquids in my body for once
16684060	16688380	I can't believe it. I can't believe hydrating means that you have to pee. It's a terrible cycle
16688940	16694780	Terrific one. Wow, this has been four hours. Yes. Sorry if you had anything important to do
16696620	16698620	Hope I haven't distracted you too much
16701820	16704940	Because I'll level in over here or just stand on a boot
16705500	16710060	I assume the the reeflings that stand about like outside have already achieved these kind of things
16710780	16712940	And they're just like them just happy to be here
16714140	16717180	Because you could be level enough casually on the side, you never know
16722140	16725580	You'll be eeping. Don't worry the collab vods will stay up. Um
16727420	16729980	Mersey doesn't have a warning. She's actually been very good
16730540	16734700	YouTube has not given mersey a warning so I have faith that the vod will not be taken down
16735340	16738300	Um, and like I don't really see anything too outrageous
16739260	16743820	My main account got wiped. I'm giving up on runescape. Oh, no
16745580	16749740	How does an account get wiped if it got hacked they reset it but give you it all back?
16750780	16752780	Like they reset the stats
16755100	16758060	I don't even know how you'd wipe an account. I don't like your bank, I guess
16759820	16761580	Hmm
16761580	16766060	Brand new account because of you. No, I'm in it. You're in it too deep. Yeah, I got resets
16766700	16769660	I mean, they should get your name back though, but that sucks
16773180	16779740	That's all right, our say so cool. Hi, literally mersey the goodest girl. She's like the one I don't have to worry about ever getting banned
16781100	16784620	She's just so good. I bet you she does come out with some stuff. I just have no clue because
16785420	16787420	when she streams is
16787500	16791740	I can catch icy in the morning if I wake up before streams, but recently I've been waking up
16792700	16796060	Oh, I was up so late last night waiting for this
16796540	16802940	Fuck and file to upload so I can send it to the editor to test her out and see if we're a good fit for each other
16803660	16807500	I sent her a women joke. So I hope she doesn't get offended by it
16808060	16810300	someone clipped me in the
16811260	16813260	legend is Zelda stream
16813420	16815660	And so someone was like, oh those
16816460	16820860	Those rope jewels always freaked me out as a child because they just take your money or something
16821340	16823500	And ask it in the way they read it
16823820	16827420	The way they said it was like something along the lines of and then I went oh
16827580	16829740	Isn't that just what women are or something like that?
16830220	16836860	And I sent the joke. So if I get fired as a commission, I know what I know what a clip was the one too far
16840460	16845020	Yeah, someone clipped it and I was like, oh, you know what turn that into a joke and I'll see what happens
16845500	16847500	and
16847580	16852060	To I explained like oh, this is what the enemy looks like in the video game. That was me
16852700	16858780	Yeah, well, I can see your clips. I'm not kidding your clips helped out like I went through my clips and I had a few more to send over
16859420	16867580	I sent an audio clip of a someone in the other stream was like, oh, you cannae you cannae clap
16868780	16871740	Your cheeks basically and then like I stood up and instantly did it
16872220	16874700	I've sent that to be edited in a clip
16874780	16880220	So I don't know if this chick's going to be running for the hills when she realized what I've asked her to make for me
16880620	16883980	Or if she's like going to be like solid and be like, oh, this is hilarious for me
16884380	16889260	Because it's probably quite drastically different from like the regular stuff she gets commissioned for
16889900	16892700	And I'm just like, oh, here's me. Here's an audio sound of my
16894220	16900540	Basically as I I stand up like it's so silly. So either she'll be down or she won't but she's Aussie so
16900780	16902780	I don't actually
16903100	16904380	um
16904380	16907900	Expect any issues because Aussies are pretty humorous
16908300	16912780	Uh got pretty good humor not the clip of the being the boy you're cute
16914060	16916060	I wouldn't edit it be like that's cheeky
16916940	16920300	And it probably goes through so many emotions when receiving the videos. Yeah
16921500	16925340	Uh Aussie internet is terrible. I uploaded
16926060	16928380	and
16928380	16931980	So, you know youtube shorts. So take mercy shorts, for example
16932220	16935980	I have to send off what is known as an mov file, which is
16936460	16942940	A full transparent file off to the editor the problem with mov files. They are absolutely
16943740	16949100	Humongous for no reason and no need now. I know you might say why don't you use green screen?
16950540	16955820	Look at the color of my hair in my outfit. Why don't I use green screen? Don't ever talk to me again. It's such
16956460	16958460	useless and I'm just gonna um
16959500	16963340	So it's just easier to send mov files like emmy for example
16963420	16968700	You say, huh emmy emmy can use a green screen actually emmy can't she has a green jewel on her necklace
16968940	16977100	Can't use green screen. Anyway, so I it was like 7 p.m. I was getting 8 p.m. I'm waiting for this file to upload
16977180	16982140	I'm like please upload so I can send this per chicken audio of me clapping without my hands
16982860	16984460	I was getting
16984460	16990220	Exhausted and I was like I'm gonna have me fucking sleep and me energy for runescape and then obviously as soon as I came online
16990300	16997340	I'm like, hi guys like I have all the energy in the world. I kid you know, I leech energy from refunds. It's true because seriously
16998380	17001900	Billy more, you know blue screen exists too. What's blue screen?
17003180	17006700	What if I tell you that you can't clap will you give us another demonstration? No
17007340	17009340	I have to only do once
17009340	17010380	Cheeky
17010380	17017020	Um, I sent away five like pre-made edit shorts type things and then I sent away like seven
17017420	17024220	Stream clips that I thought were mildly humorous two of them might not be able to be turned into a clip due to the nature of them
17024300	17032380	just like some moments are funny on stream, but they cannot be translated into a youtube short because there's not enough context
17032380	17036220	There's not enough time and you're limited to less than 59 seconds
17036380	17040620	Basically less than a minute. Sorry blue screen is like green screen, but blue. Oh
17041500	17046620	Sorry, I understand what you're saying. Yes. No, I don't know what you mean, but like it's just
17047020	17050140	MOV files are just to go to the the easiest to
17051660	17058700	Thingy, but anyway, I got it sent off is the long and short of it. Um, and I got pretty poor sleep unfortunately
17059660	17060540	Oh
17060540	17066540	Cuz I didn't get my my full eight hours. Oh, no. I didn't get ever sleep. I'm a little by me
17066940	17071980	And as much as I'd like for you to visit with Jeremy don't come here the internet quality and price are horrible. Oh
17073020	17078900	My dad went to Berlin and he absolutely loved it. And he was wanting to go back to Berlin
17078900	17083260	I might be doing a Europe tour with my dad on ironic clue. Um
17083660	17084780	Um
17084780	17091660	It depends what happens next year. Um, my dad might officially be retiring depending on if
17093980	17097500	You know if I do you're done basically paying for his retirement long story short
17097900	17102620	Um, but I was wanting to celebrate it if he does retire and I was like
17103180	17105180	Do you want to go on a european tour?
17105420	17112300	Because my dad likes traveling around europe like he really likes the multiculturalism of all even though
17112300	17114780	He cannot speak speak a lick of any
17114940	17116220	Um
17116220	17121020	He cannot speak a lick of any of the languages nor does he bother. He's like the oh
17121340	17122860	He my dad is polite as anything
17122860	17123900	He's like, oh, hello
17123900	17128220	And then he'll point to the menu with a smile on his face and doesn't say anything else and I was like, oh, okay
17128300	17129420	okay, dad
17129420	17130700	um
17130700	17137020	But uh, he wants to go back to germany. So I might actually be in germany at one point to be crazy
17137980	17142700	Congrats on whoever loved it. I also came back after I love you and break just to watch the call fish
17143420	17145820	I'm dragging yous back into the runescape home
17146860	17152220	Probs are proud dad. Yeah, he wants to go to berlin because he loved it. I absolutely loved it
17153100	17157500	I can't remember what mom and dad did in berlin though. No before anyone makes any jokes
17159180	17164380	I don't want to know what my parents get up to when they're alone in a foreign city. I do not want to know
17165180	17166620	Um
17166620	17170780	I think they did like the classic tourism stuff in berlin. I don't know
17171580	17173580	If they went anywhere
17173900	17177100	Because I think my mom's pal came along as well. I'm just trying to remember
17178460	17183500	But my mom and my mom's pal went off to go visit some of the
17184700	17187900	a monuments like, um
17189180	17191420	Outfits and that just to like get all the
17192380	17195820	Cause like you can go see like all this the stuff and that
17196220	17200620	Um, I think my dad was just alone in the city and he went away for some food and that and the thingy
17200940	17205180	And just like laughing at the thought of my dad being alone being like, I love you guys
17205820	17207820	God and yeah
17208060	17212460	A bit of ironing like uh, uh the thought of my dad trying to speak german of
17213900	17220060	Why berlin is the ugliest city? Well, let's say it's where the tourists go and I mean there's all is it's very easily accessible
17220060	17225980	It's very, uh, English-ified as well for tourists and you have to understand tourists like familiarity
17226060	17229820	So if there's a place that's like, oh, there's got English things about they're gonna be want to go there, you know
17231660	17233660	Uh, oh god
17233980	17235740	Spotted in europe
17235740	17241660	Well, there is the possibility of like going to italy because I want to go and see
17242300	17244300	Roma and I want to go see
17245180	17248380	Uh venice all because of assassins creed. Yes. I said it
17248380	17255180	Yes, I want to go to roma and assassin's creed and uh venice for assassin's creed
17255420	17260140	No, I don't care if that makes me some weeb gamer. I don't give a shit. I want to see it. I want to see it
17261420	17263420	um
17263420	17265420	Going to hamburger to eat the first hamburger
17265420	17269340	I don't know if the girls are trying to convince me to come to america. Like I'll do it for them
17271180	17277980	Because azura was like I can't I was at azure sheebie one of them was like, oh, I'll take you out to like either
17278060	17282540	I'll take you out or I'll make you like a decent. I think azure is actually like a decent cook
17282780	17286140	I can't remember. I might be a zura. I might just be making that up and I'm going to get sprang
17286540	17288540	most likely the last option
17288540	17290300	um
17290300	17293980	Germans also don't like speaking german. Yeah, if you go to germany visit
17295980	17302060	It's basically a disney castello. Oh my feature revealer. You are an anime girl on the internet. You are the weeb. Ah
17302860	17304860	I always say I'm a gamer over a weeb
17305260	17306140	and
17306140	17313980	Like azura her freaking anime knowledge is like limitless. Holy crap. I'm like, uh, I just play expo 360 games to be honest
17313980	17317260	And I'm stuck on the nostalgia of them because I like familiarity
17318060	17323500	Uh, although saying that and each of her means I get to like try games for the new time
17323580	17329180	Like I will not stop talking about it buckshot relay and needy streamer overload
17329580	17333900	These kind of games that are actually smaller in length are so
17335420	17336460	um
17336460	17340060	Appeasing to the streamer profile if you will
17340860	17347660	It's why I'm interested in producing games that are roughly no more than four hours in length like wrap it up
17348220	17351020	Wrap it up. I don't I don't want to be playing the same game for like ages
17351500	17353500	I think it is very uh
17353660	17358540	Obtainable to streamers kind of this four hour thingy, which is why I came up with a cookie clicker game
17358860	17362140	That's actually completable. Um, if you didn't know they're
17362860	17367740	Uh, the the the og cookie clicker game. Um, it's not completable
17368220	17374060	Um within four hours unless, you know, wall hacks are on are you doing 360 noscopes through the map?
17374700	17375820	um
17375820	17379980	Which is why I concepted a game for the first time in my life like that
17380540	17381500	um
17381500	17387580	Obviously making via lures games kind of giving me a bit of an insight of what happens, but the reality is I've been very hands off
17387660	17390060	I just explained what I wanted and what I needed
17390620	17396700	Um and paid for it. Um, I ordered the artwork and stuff. I got some I got an artist that was comfortable with all body types
17396860	17397740	um
17397740	17399740	mersey actually previewed
17400140	17402140	her scene artwork
17402220	17405180	If you want to check out mersey's alt, um
17406700	17410940	It's currently getting animated right now and then I need to cut up everyone's voices
17411500	17414140	And then the game's pretty much ready to ship. Um
17414780	17418540	Wait, I don't know how long this animator is going to take. I do not know the animator
17418620	17424220	They were outsourced by the developer for me because I didn't have anyone that did this kind of thing
17425340	17430780	Um, but it's been a fantastic learning experience behind the scenes of being like I want this I want that
17430860	17435820	I will do this you do that and then we just you know and came together with the games there. Um
17436620	17438620	Our save file is a thing in this game
17439580	17441580	And the VLR game no you don't need a
17442860	17444860	Oh, there is actually
17445980	17448540	You get rewarded if you replay the game
17450300	17455500	I I specifically wanted a 20 minute experience. I think it's maybe each round
17456060	17459580	Like finish it. I think it takes like 30 minutes to go over like the
17460540	17462540	to finalize the
17462860	17466540	Situation I want to be vague on purpose because I don't want to spoil it
17467100	17470300	Um, but the more you replay it the more you can unlock
17471580	17476220	Something and not scenes you have access to all of the scenes right off the bat
17476860	17478860	If you through your first playthrough
17478940	17483340	But for people who enjoyed it or just want to see you know what the other stuff is
17483820	17490380	There is a small amount of replayability. Um, and it was a bit important to have a bit of replayability because
17490780	17494300	Um, yeah, no one I mean 30 minutes and then you're done. I mean
17494940	17496060	Yeah
17496060	17498700	Can you save in the game? I assume so
17499900	17503100	Uh, the game is free to play but I think you can save your progress
17503100	17506380	So if you are looking forward to a certain
17507100	17514140	Scene or animation with one of your favorite girly pops from velour then uh, yes, I believe you can access that right away
17514780	17516620	um
17516620	17518620	Resident evil you think I play
17519580	17525020	It do you know it cost millions to develop these kind of games you think I had millions in my back pocket
17525100	17530220	No, it's a free to access game. I've got cute little artwork to go with it
17531740	17536540	Girls are voice acted at the cost through this much like okay. Can you save in game? I don't know
17537340	17539340	Was there a hoon for it? I don't know
17539980	17542540	I really need a pee but I'm about to end stream
17543420	17549660	Ah, I can't believe it the peeler allegations. Oh, I can't do it. I actually really need a tinkle now that I know
17549660	17551660	All right. I've got eight minutes. I can hold on
17552380	17557740	Oh my god, it's not pee. It's a two. Oh, it's both. It's both at the same time. I'm not gonna make it
17559020	17561340	So you're super excited millions of gp
17562460	17567980	You don't have millions. How are you gonna buy the castello? Um, I'm gonna work for it
17568940	17573820	I will I'm gonna work hard for it. I need to pay my ASMR debts
17573820	17579180	I need to pay my ASMR collab debts because there's three girls still waiting on my dang edit and I do apologize
17580060	17582140	But I did record my lines, which is the best part
17584300	17586620	Pixely rpgs games remind me of
17587740	17591820	Wow pixel games. Oh, that's so cool. What pixel? Oh
17593100	17595100	pixel
17595180	17597180	Pixel oh, that's amazing
17598860	17600860	Hint hint cough cough nudge nudge
17602540	17605020	For the gameplay. Anyway, not the actual art. Um
17606300	17608300	Working on things in this economy
17609340	17611340	No, I say we steal a castello
17612620	17619100	Well, we just steal castello santian. We can live in italy surely are the lines fairtile in italy
17620060	17626700	Shawnee take the mic where you go. No, not yet. As I said, azura has to pass the baton to me if azura doesn't pass the baton
17627660	17633340	I can I am confirming or denying the aligank the aligankies the aligankies um
17634380	17636380	of peeler
17637260	17639260	Uh
17639980	17644780	Working on things in this. I know I need to work hard. She works hard for the money
17645820	17647020	and
17647020	17650060	I need to do azura and ac script next
17650220	17655020	That's probably one of my top priorities because I want everyone to be 5k by the end of this month
17656860	17658860	um
17658860	17660860	And at least 5k
17662940	17668140	I'll see what happens if I can get some editors to do some clips of the girls and fart some money into them
17668140	17670140	But me me editors they're gone
17670940	17675500	All of them are like one of them's like i'm sick other ones like uh, I've got in real life stuff
17675660	17679020	Other ones let my pc just fucking explode and i'm like, okay. Thanks. Um
17680780	17683820	We're getting hints. I feel so special and sorry for all the rooflings out here
17684300	17687820	I always give like a little peeper preview or something in between streams
17687820	17693980	It's just as a a special thank you for like listening in because I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea type thing. Um
17694860	17700940	But uh, thank you for tolerating me. Here's some insider knowledge that you everyone gets to know about in about a month's time
17702380	17707660	You know, I can't I can't stop yapping and releasing all my projects. Okay. I just get so excited
17708780	17710780	Man, I'm a lot of excitement for my project
17714060	17716700	They're all lying. They're all gonna play elton ring. I'm calling it now
17718700	17720700	Wait, who's playing elton ring the girls?
17722140	17724860	Or did I misunderstand? I mean I misunderstood your message
17725820	17728220	That's a very high probability. Thank you for tolerating me
17729500	17732140	A month it's so close. Yeah, the the game
17733180	17736300	The game production started in february all the everything's there
17736380	17739820	We're just waiting on the animation sequence because there's an animation scene
17740540	17742540	when you
17744540	17746700	Uh, complete the objective
17747420	17752060	Um, I think I almost just spoiled the game there. You know that. Um
17753740	17755740	Yes, when you
17756620	17762940	Do the mission objective? Yep, that's fine to say. Uh, you unlock a scene with a girl
17764220	17766220	And you take it from there
17768060	17771020	You take it from there you do that now you play one handed
17771980	17775180	Um, I'll be very surprised
17777020	17781420	Uh, yeah, it's unfortunate how many editors are in disposed as
17783020	17785020	scottles lunches
17785100	17786780	Yeah
17786780	17793580	As a game dev myself, is it cool if I attempt to you can absolutely make a fan game. No problems at all. Um
17794540	17800940	I honestly don't I don't I don't know why all these fucking companies have so many rules as long as it's not like derogatory
17801180	17803340	Or you're saying shite about the girls like
17805020	17807980	It's all good. All your editors are playing elden ring right now. Oh
17809100	17811100	probably
17811500	17814460	I'll actually have like three guys have a new guy on board. Um
17816780	17818780	And just like
17819740	17822780	It takes a while, but I'll see how I go with my
17823820	17830220	Me me me Aussie editor my girl editor. Actually, I wouldn't mind talking about her on stream if she's comfortable with it
17830220	17833420	That sounds really weird though. Hey, can I talk about you on stream?
17835020	17837020	The way you edit my clips
17839660	17843420	So, okay. All right, you freak give me a moment. Just pay me the money. I'll shut up
17848780	17850780	Oh
17855020	17860460	No, it's Johnny spoil in the ending. What tries you to someone no, it's not even the ending. There's like there's rounds
17861580	17867660	There's rounds and you got pick you gotta pick the girl and there's rounds and if you succeed in your mission objective
17867740	17869740	You get to
17871020	17874940	Um, there's also it's not really hidden dialogue
17875020	17881020	But you can pick the girls in a different order and you'll hear a different line depending on what order you pick them in
17881180	17883180	but it's not like a
17883260	17885100	Oh, there's like super hidden
17885100	17889660	Crazy lore. It's like no you you won't hear that sentence unless you pick that girl in that sequence
17889820	17892700	It's that kind of thing. You don't actually miss out on anything and then
17895980	17901820	Um for the ending scene unfortunately the ending scene didn't go the way I wanted it to fucked up
17901980	17903980	Um
17904620	17908940	But it's all good in the hood. I actually think it's quite adorable. I think you guys will like it rounds like pokemon
17910140	17914460	Rounds no, no not like strategy turn base. It's a freak. Yes, boys. Go
17915340	17918460	It's trying to break in NDAs motherfucker. I am the NDA
17920540	17922140	No, I don't even
17922140	17927740	There was a contract signed with the game developer unfortunately because of how much money was passing through the hands
17928700	17934220	Um, but I mean it's all I mean everything I've seen what I've seen all looks good to me. Um
17935580	17939820	I think mersey's name is actually wrong in the video game right now and I need to tell them
17941420	17943180	It's not karam
17943180	17950300	I I told you that mersey's name got changed very late in development. It's very possible right now. She's called karam in the game
17951580	17953580	I need to check in with the game dev actually
17953660	17956940	I've just been running out of time everywhere like everywhere I have ran out of time
17957340	17963500	And I'm like it'll settle soon and it will settle soon. I just need to get to the stage where it settles soon
17963580	17966380	I'm just not there yet. Like once um
17967260	17969740	Especially when my dad comes and sees me
17970460	17974060	Um, because I'll be doing those like four hour streams. I have to admit
17974060	17977020	It's probably gonna be a lot easier to like keep on top of everything
17977820	17978940	um
17978940	17986380	But like my plans have an expiration like you know, like aw strongy aren't you stretching yourself too thin doing the 1,000
17987020	17988060	uh
17988060	17991740	Celebration videos every 1000 one ace more video every 1000
17992220	17998220	Yeah, but it ends at a certain point and growth is an infinite like it'll slow down like it's definitely it'll slow down
17998220	18004460	There's no doubt about it. I like oh, but what about the um ace more clubs? You're doing what other v-tubers again?
18004460	18007580	It's gonna slow down. It's not infinite growth like it's it's
18008540	18010700	I have a goal of doing 100 v-tubers
18010780	18017340	I can do it all in one month if I really wanted to um or I can take my time and do it over the span of many months
18017340	18020220	Like everything everything slows down
18020460	18022460	It's just obviously debut happened
18023020	18027740	And then everything exploded and now everything's going to slowly come back like once the video game goes up
18027820	18030700	Like my next project is getting on a game show for the girls
18031180	18036620	And then the next project uh Azura's got her lovely donut song coming up next project like it's not
18037660	18040780	It's not like an absolute hammer in like as I said
18040780	18047020	We're getting clippers in place now because it was hard to get clippers in place before the girls were producing content because that's not possible
18047900	18051900	Um reeflings we aim for a million no no do not aim for a million
18052140	18054380	I'll be happy with a play button
18055100	18059340	As as myself as strony cuttles and then after that i'm like right we're done
18060780	18065660	I mean I'll still keep going but I'm not doing like any more celebratory type stuff
18068380	18072220	You spread scrawny scrawny propaganda on tiktok and instagram
18073820	18075180	Oh
18075180	18077260	Right, okay. It's time
