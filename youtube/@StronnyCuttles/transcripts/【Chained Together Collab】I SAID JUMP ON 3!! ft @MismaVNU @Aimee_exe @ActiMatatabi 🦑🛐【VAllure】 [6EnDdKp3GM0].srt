60
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,460

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,020
don't need checkpoint don't look down where we do that was a mistake I'm not

65
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,300
doing that again do you get like terrified of heights and even in video

66
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,100
games I get ton of vision in video games we're like I feel like I'm in it like

67
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,980
when I get really panicky I think I'm actually in the game like that's why I

68
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,020
can't really play horror games because it freaks me out yeah no me too me too like I

69

can't differentiate that it's just if it's just a no real oh my god is this um

70
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,060
that why I wish you that's not it won't kill us but we'll fly off if we hit it

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,220
and we would have to go all the way back to the start is there no we have to jump

86
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:06,780
Vtuber sin my Vtuber sin that I just quit the game right now accidentally uh yeah that is

87
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:19,180
your sin that is your game right now how did you manage it was it did it shut down

88
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,540
because because I'm lagging so I was trying to set the FPS down and I wanted to press

89
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,780
like okay but it said the game and I pressed quit and I'm just not reading actually um

90
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,500
I mean that's a Vtuber sin you're not reading

91
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,380
nay okay so we're just losing progress I saved the game yeah is that really a Vtuber sin then

92
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,660
I mean I don't think so I mean will you get a pick let's find out let's find out if you'll get out

93
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:56,700
okay yeah I mean what's your Vtuber sin I play some games okay real I'm sure um

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:06,540
I see that I'm playing oh my gosh I'm doing team dark next I'm really excited oh my god you're

95
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,820
gonna do 100 completion uh maybe not a hundred percent but I'll get the emerald so I can finish

96
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:22,460
like the story of it oh my god that's so good um my Vtuber sin is I picked my gen mate selfishly

97
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:29,820
because I love them and I want the best for them so is that a sin though well I don't think that's

98
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:37,340
this man all right okay maybe that that's like quiet redemption if anything like a holy thing

99
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:45,180
okay okay my sin I admit it's a flashing someone bro come on well I mean maybe like you're overworking

100
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,660
yourself maybe miss ma and myself aren't too far apart because I may or may not have shared very

101
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,060
unique photos with my gen mates

102
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,740
what you're saying the the fucking the fucking the fucking red guy is talking way too

103
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,500
fucking low what you say oh you got the devil guy on you yeah I had the devil guy I'll be

104
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:17,180
maybe because she reconnected oh maybe because I because yeah I didn't hear what she said just

105
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,140
because I was saying my sin is maybe not so different from miss ma we are maybe from the same

106
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:29,420
book because uh I I may have shown myself to my gen mate so if the discord ever gets leaked

107
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,820
oh no we're all in a lot of trouble because we were all like oh here's what I look like here's

108
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,620

you're already in the cult no only

140
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,020

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,580
oh okay the bone that's so skinny oh um is there a tactic to this one um

144
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:05,100
no which way to go okay we can go right we take a little left but we have to make it to the right

145
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:14,380

171
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,460

00:26:51,980 --> 00:27:00,220
we locked in locked in come on gamers we can do this we're we're totally going to reach the

186
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:08,300
first checkpoint for the industry real and true I don't know where actually we're so good at this

187
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,140
I wonder if the more people is it easier or harder because I feel like doing this solar

188
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,940
would be cheating because the whole point is to be chained to someone you can do this alone if it's

189
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:28,380
called chained again I don't know you could just change the loan who are you you're chained to your own

190
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:42,140
oh my god I get you up all in chain maybe oh maybe goodness gracious act you're scaring me

191
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,060
yeah I was gonna say

192
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,380
just jumping willy-nilly on like a very thin oh this is awkward to claim okay

193
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,460
we're claiming on the skull chain to your own sins actually real and

194
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,940
uh where are we supposed to go that's a great analogy are we supposed to land on that

195
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:16,220
rock with the veins straight ahead yeah yeah okay ready for something okay three two one

196
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,260

204
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,780

205

218
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:51,820
to go at the same time so if you could okay we can all switch really close I really got my head

219

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,740
side of the ladder hold on I'm on the wrong side oh my god okay I don't know how we did that but that

223
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,700
was good we didn't what happened did we stop no no no no it's because we were too close to when

224
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,380
we were above it yeah when we were above it sorry the bottom of us got clipped by it yeah

225
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:42,060
oh we survived though yeah that's the main thing yeah right I'm so glad we did not lose that

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,140
At least we know like the threshold or like what is the...

279
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,160
The game is forgiving.

280
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,220

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

290
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,820
This is broken for me.

291
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,340
My character was climbing in on space for so long.

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,140

Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,180
What do you mean we've only reached one checkpoint?

296
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

297
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,500
I know that.

298
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,140
They hate to see pretty girls win.

299
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,620
Exactly.

300
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,980
They hate to see me eat.

301
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,500
OK.

302
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,460
No, no, no, no.

303
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:52,960
Oh, sorry.

304
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

305
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

306
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
OK, OK, wait, wait, wait for the next one.

307
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,780
Three, two, one.

308
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,020
Go, go, go, go, send it, send it, send it.

309
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,260
OK, OK, OK, OK, we're good.

310
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,020
We're good, we're good.

311
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,980
Lovely, I love to see it.

312
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
I love the like, go, go, go, go, go.

313
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,460
Just send it, send it.

314
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,020
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, next one, next one.

315
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,380
Three, two, go, go, just send it, just send it, just send it.

316
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,880
Yay!

317
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,860
Oh my god, we did it.

318
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Yay.

319
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,820
We're trying to, it gets me every time.

320
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,460
You're so calm beforehand.

321
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,180
You're like, OK, no, not this time.

322
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,260
Everybody go, go, go, go.

323
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,540
Go, just please, go, just please.

324
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,700
Girl tonnage.

325
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,580
Is this a bedroom?

326
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,820
Yeah, how are people living up here?

327
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,820
Right, I'm stuck.

328
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,340
Oh, no, oh.

329
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,260
Are you just stuck through?

330
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
None of things, no.

331
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,780
Right, I sleep in, I'm sleeping in this one here.

332
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,260
This is my sleeping spot right here.

333
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,180
I can sleep underneath it.

334
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,660
Yeah, this can be like a bunker.

335
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,060
Yeah, a bunker bed, yeah.

336
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,180
OK, we going, right?

337
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,740
Use it.

338
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,820
I'm the ladder.

339
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,140
There's no spikes on this one.

340
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,180
OK, we're fine, we're safe.

341
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,500
There's no spikes on this ladder.

342
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,700
So it's not a challenge.

343
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,180
Surely we will not fail.

344
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,300
Surely.

345
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:19,780
Well, in this next part, it's fine, it's fine.

346
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,380
We just got to time our jump on it.

347
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,020
All together, like, the spikes.

348
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,140
All right, I'll do a countdown.

349
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,060
We all jump on and we all jump off at the correct time.

350
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,900
Does that make sense?

351
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,380
Yeah.

352
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,940
OK, not this one, but next one.

353
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,820
Three, two, one, jump, and then jump.

354
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,820
Oh, no.

355
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,820
Oh, no.

356
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Oh, no.

357
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,820
And four.

358
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,820
OK, OK, well, no, no, keep going, keep going.

359
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling.

360
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,820
I'm on, I'm on.

361
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
No.

362
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,300
No, this is all right.

363
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,820
OK, OK, I can't do anything.

364
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,820
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

365
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,380
Hold on, aim, aim, aim.

366
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,660
No, you're not going.

367
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,540
OK, OK, OK.

368
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,020
This is fun.

369
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,020
It's not that bad.

370
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,380
It's not that bad.

371
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,140
What if I need the game again?

372
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,540
I won't.

373
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,660
You can't fail.

374
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,620
You're going to fail.

375
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,580
You're stuck with us.

376
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,860
Last time I did, we got 2P2R.

377
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,900
OK, we're going to jump across.

378
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,140
I just got to go back on the skeleton.

379
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,380
Maybe.

380
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,800
I wonder if you can like speedrun it solo.

381
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,840
I'm sure there's like a category of like speedrunning in plays that do it solo.

382
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,680
Like once you've done the area I guess you know what's up because like obviously we don't

383
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,840
have to think about this one too much because we've done it so it really is a new location

384
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:57,320
unlocked right need to learn because those spikes on that ladder took us a hot second.

385
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,880
Yeah I think like the less it's a little easier but like it was the point if you don't have

386
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,400
someone change to you.

387
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Yeah yeah.

388
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah yeah.

389
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,720
Someone's like you could say we just got borned, but oh and I've taken us the wrong way excuse

390
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
me.

391
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,440
Oh turn around take this train back to the station.

392
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,160
Okay what way was it?

393
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,400
Okay it's to the right it's to the right that's where I went wrong is this way.

394
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,360
Oh no no no back to the green to Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.

395
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Scooby-Doo.

396
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Oh where are you?

397
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:41,480
Oh I'm sorry I'm pulling I'm pulling it's we are wait why aren't you coming up?

398
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't know why.

399
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh no.

400
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,600
Probably because we're like three person.

401
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,080
Is there not enough space to bring you up?

402
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,120
Okay oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

403
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Oh no.

404
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm sure what did that happen?

405
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
It's ogre.

406
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
It's ogre.

407
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Well it's ogre.

408
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,800
Oh our chain is the hook.

409
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Our chain is the hook.

410
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,720
It got on the two things.

411
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,800
Oh no right that's it find the angel wings where are they are they down here cause we're

412
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
flying.

413
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Bro we're flying.

414
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
We're the angel wings.

415
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,760
I've never seen the angel wings playing this.

416
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,160
Oh my god this is a fun show.

417
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:28,160
I thought we had like you know what skills.

418
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,160
No we still have that.

419
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:43,520
I thought we had like oh see yeah actually the strat would be to like like would it load

420
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
into the checkpoint.

421
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,960
I don't think so cause that's no no no that's where you disconnected and that's where we're

422
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,120
going to spawn when you connect again.

423
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,120
So not checkpoint I don't think.

424
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,960
Bro okay okay it's fine it's fine what does this do.

425
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:10,160
I thought the the checkpoint is um if anyone's played it when you get to like the tomb area

426
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,320
so I thought that was like they really no we're nowhere close to it.

427
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,720
Wait someone says you got checkpoints turned on alright who would turn them off for one

428
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:28,200
close then say load checkpoint hell city heaven what wait okay hell maybe cause you're the

429
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,640
leader you can do it.

430
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,520
Load checkpoint you have not unlocked this checkpoint city you have not unlocked this

431
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,440
checkpoint what's hell you have not unlocked I've not unlocked any checkpoint apparently

432
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,040
apparently yeah if your character is stuck somewhere this option teleport you to the

433
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,320
nearest safe point highest point unlocked in case of significant fall teleport to the

434
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,320
highest point you've been.

435
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:02,640
Oh sorry we did do it we did get to it but oh thank gosh I'm surprised oh no thank.

436
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,920
I think we jumped too early cause like we were sliding off sideways yeah yeah I agree right

437
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,560
so we need to let it like delay a bit and then jump on cause it will go back to being

438
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
more flat.

439
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,520
Yeah cause I couldn't I jumped but I couldn't even like stand on it so I just fell.

440
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,680
Okay we love we love the dev team show to the dev team right not this one but the next

441
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:30,520
one and you have to be a bit delayed so three two kind of little go go go go go yeah yeah yeah.

442
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,520
Oh no I slipped I slipped I slipped.

443
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
It's okay it's okay.

444
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,960
Let me do the same thing as before instead of jumping it was too close so I kind of just

445
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,960
slipped.

446
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,480
Oh right wait right so if I just tell us to like keep going.

447
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,920
Keep going back to that point is that cheeky doodling or is this allowed?

448
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,720
No you know what it's fair game that's it's going back to our like we're here for progress

449
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
we're here.

450
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,720
We just chaos controlled this one.

451
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Three places where we can do this.

452
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,720
Okay all right like that one.

453
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,720
So did we do it too early again?

454
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,440
To me I was too close and I was not I slipped because it made

455
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,920
the animation of like when you like you climb yeah it's just I was climbing on something

456
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,680
moving I just fell after like I was I guess I was too close I had to jump.

457
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,480
Okay we'll try and delay right now this one but the next one we'll do the delay again

458
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:41,480
like we'll do it super late that feels like okay three two one go again.

459
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Don't worry don't worry don't worry pull pull pull.

460
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,520
I think we gotta jump where you're going.

461
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,520
How did you do that?

462
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Oh my god if you're stuck press near safety.

463
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
You got it?

464
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Okay cool.

465
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Who?

466
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,520
I think we gotta jump when it's going off instead of when it's going in.

467
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Like okay you meant like no like kind of thing.

468
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,520

Okay why is this one so hard?

479
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,600
I don't know the basis.

480
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,600
A little bit earlier?

481
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,600
Yeah earlier.

482
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,600

That was way better.

493
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,640
I want to use your gamer instinct and then wait.

494
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,640
Yeah I think because of the latency when it feels right.

495
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
Yeah I think because of the latency.

496
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,640
Like pretend you're solo.

497
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Okay okay.

Oh yes yes yes yes.

Where are you?

511
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
We're under you.

512
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,680
You have to get close to an edge so you can pull us up.

513
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Is it working or not pulling?

514
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,680
No no no we're under.

515
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,680
We're stuck under the.

516
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
I'm pressing E on you.

517
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,720
We're very far off.

518
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Wait get close to the edge on the left for you.

00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,720
And then you just get in.

524
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,720
You're like very directly.

525
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,720
Is it pulling?

526
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Wait it's not even pulling me.

527
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,720
To the edge.

533
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
I'm connected to Amy.

534
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Why is it pulling me?

535
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,760

Yes yes yes just.

539
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,760
I pressed space bar to jump up.

540
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,760
No don't move just stay to the edge please.

541
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,760
Just yeah you need to be closer to the edge.

542
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,760
We're still under.

543
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Press space bar if you can against something.

544
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
Oh yeah yeah.

545
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
Why is that?

546
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Okay okay okay okay.

547
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,760
Oh hey we did it we did it.

Okay yeah.

551
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
We never have to do the swing again.

552
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
I mean I mean we never did it right.

553
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
We just happened to make it across.

554
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Honestly.

555
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Right.

556
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
I feel like there was a lot of glitching going on too.

557
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
Are we ready?

558
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Who's got the squeaky's gamer chair?

559
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800

560
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
It's me I have no money.

561
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Okay let's move on.

562
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Oh no.

563
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Ready.

564
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,840

565
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,840
Okay.

566
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,840
Three two one.

567
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Three two one.

568
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,840
That was a baby.

569
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,840
That's not easy.

570
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Three two one.

571
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Good good good good.

572
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Three two one.

573
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
I got really excited for that jump though.

574
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
Uh.

575
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Uh.

576
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
Yeah across.

577
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
I have a bad feeling.

578
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
But let's just let's just go.

579
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,880
Is it this way?

580
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,880
It has to be look at that.

581
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Oh oh yeah yeah it is it is.

582
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
We need to jump.

583
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
We're playing warp out.

584
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
I see poles.

585
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,880
We have to jump over those.

586
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
We have to jump on the platform.

587
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
No not yet.

588
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,920
She said jump and she's like.

589
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,920
She said she was just like okay.

590
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Jump how high?

591
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,920
Okay okay.

592
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Right not this one but next one.

593
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
So we will all go on that platform

594
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
and then we will you'll have to jump

595
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,920
when it's correct on your screen

596
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
because we can jump differently from each other

597
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,920
so it has to be correct on your screen.

598
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,920
Okay now we're going to get on the platform now.

599
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,920
On the platform and then jump

600
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,920
when it's correct on your screen.

601
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,960
Did we do it?

602
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Did you get it?

603
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Oh my god.

604
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
I don't know if I'm supposed to be.

605
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
Press E to pull us up.

606
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Oh wait okay okay.

607
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
Oh yeah.

608
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Oh my god I don't know how we did that

609
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,960
but I'm happy with that result.

610
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,960
Did I get you?

611
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,960
Did I get you?

612
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,960
I can pull you up.

613
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,960
Did I get you?

614
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,960
Did I get you?

615
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Did I get you?

616
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I can pull you up.

617
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You can jump up 20 I think.

618
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm spamming that space bar.

619
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm spamming harder in my life.

620
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh my head is getting there.

621
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Did I get you?

622
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Alright cool.

623
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Alright we made it we chased it

624
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but it was fun.

625
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I love how I'm the one that missed the jump

626
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and I got to this thing.

627
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You literally saved our savior.

628
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
She's an angel.

629
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
No.

630
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
No I'm on the other side of the friggin...

631
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040

632
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
I'm going in.

633
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040

634
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,040

Don't panic.

649
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,080

Don't baby jump.

653
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,080
I'm trying to jump.

654
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,080
I'm spamming my space bar.

655
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,080
Why?

656
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
This pill function does not work.

657
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Yeah.

658
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,120
It wants to work when it wants to.

659
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,120
I don't know if I have to like...

660
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,120
The WAS there.

661
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,120
Rotate around to get you up.

662
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,120
I literally...

663
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
It's not funny.

664
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,120
I'm kicking.

665
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,120
I'm literally pulling.

666
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,120
I'm kicking a bunch.

667
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,120
This is not happening.

668
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,120
I don't know what to do.

669
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,120
I'm back on.

670
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,120
I don't want to run yet.

671
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,160
I'm pulling.

672
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,160
I wonder if it's because the platform is so small.

673
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,160
It's not registering.

674
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,160
It looks like you're having a tantrum.

675
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
I've had enough of you guys changing me.

676
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Goodbye.

677
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,160
Wait.

678
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
It's not even letting me pill you.

679
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,160
Oh no.

680
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,160
If I did load save,

681
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,160
surely we're not going to be...

682
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
We're not going to have to go back to that swing.

683
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Oh thank goodness.

684
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
The game devs are actually nice.

685
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,200
I thought the game devs were evil,

686
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
but they're not, they're actually nice.

687
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
That is...

688
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
We love King's game devs.

689
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,200
10 out of 10 game because of King's game devs.

690
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
We're ready for the 3, 2, 1?

691
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Yes.

692
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Oh no!

693
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,200
3, 2, 1!

694
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
I have 3, 2, 1!

695
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
You said are you ready?

696
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,200
I was like, yep.

697
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
Okay, okay.

698
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Ready?

699
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,240
3, 2, 1!

700
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,240
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

701
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,240
Okay, right.

702
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
We'll aim for that platform, not the barrels.

703
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,240
3, 2, 1!

704
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
Beautiful.

705
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
Stunning, gorgeous teamwork.

706
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
I see a ladder here.

707
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,240
Yeah.

708
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,240
Oh, it is.

709
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,240
It's very hard to see.

710
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,240
We're going to do it.

711
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
Even though we're not out of the first section of the game yet,

712
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
we're totally going to do it.

713
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,280
I feel like this path is probably the hardest bit.

714
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
Really?

715
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Are you completed it fully before?

716
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,280
No, no, I haven't.

717
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Oh no.

718
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
It's like before, it's alright.

719
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,280
We have to move and jump.

720
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Okay, so unfortunately,

721
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
timing isn't a thing as possible.

722
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,280
This is gamer instinct.

723
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
So...

724
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
Are you guys ready?

725
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,280
We're going...

726
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Not this one, but next one.

727
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,320
Okay, let's just get a move on.

728
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,320
You have to jump when it's gamer time.

729
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,320
Remember, it comes back as well.

730
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,320
You have to jump when it's gamer time.

731
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
You're going to also jump behind.

732
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,320
Someone hit the...

733
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
No, it doesn't...

734
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,320
Okay, that wasn't bad.

735
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
I can't see when it's behind.

736
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,320
So when it's behind us,

737
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,320
you should turn around and walk back.

738
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,320
No, no, just turn your camera.

739
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
Okay.

740
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,360
We'll just go for it.

741
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,360
Move your mouse around.

742
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,360
That was me, that was me.

743
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Let's try again.

744
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
No need.

745
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,360
Unless, unless you wait for it

746
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,360
to go all the way at the back

747
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,360
and then we run at it,

748
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,360
so we only jump one time.

749
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Oh, that's a good idea.

750
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
This one, this one, this one, this one.

751
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,360
Go, go, go, go.

752
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,360
Chase it, chase it, and then jump.

753
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,360
That's it.

754
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Don't worry, Lee.

755
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
No, no, no.

756
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
The ray?

757
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Yeah.

758
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
Three, two, one.

759
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Okay.

760
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
With this one, you have to jump on the trampoline

761
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,400
and land on the other trampoline

762
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,400
and then jump up to the box.

763
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Okay.

764
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
Three, two, one.

765
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Oh, shit.

766
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
We can't do that.

767
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
We'll get to that.

768
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,440
Oh, no.

769
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,440
That's all right. Easy, easy, easy.

770
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,440
No, this one, next one, next one.

771
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
We did it one time, we can do it.

772
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,440
Go, go, go, go, just go for it.

773
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Okay, we go.

774
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
Easy peasy, don't worry about it.

775
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,440
Okay, that isn't rather easy.

776
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Three, two, one.

777
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Go.

778
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
Okay, and then this one,

779
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
we definitely have to sync up or else

780
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,440
we go up enough movement.

781
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
I think we gotta run too.

782
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,480
Oh, like, like, run.

783
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,480
Oh.

784
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,480
Except to run at the same time.

785
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,480
Okay.

786
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,480
On.

787
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Go.

788
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,480
Three, two, one.

789
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Go.

790
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,480
Oh, it's done and beautiful.

791
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,480
Gorgeous.

792
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,480
I love it, I'm here for it.

793
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,480
It's out, I'm getting pulled.

794
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,480
What the fuck?

795
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,480
What did I just do?

796
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
That's good, that's good.

797
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,520
It's a joy ride.

798
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,520
It's a joy ride.

799
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,520
Everything is perfect.

800
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,520
I literally went to pull you up

801
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,520
and all of a sudden we're flying.

802
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
I don't know how we did that,

803
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,520
but I'll just let it happen.

804
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,520
One of Hal's most convenient modes

805
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,520
of public transport.

806
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,520
Yeah.

807
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Oh, look at the view.

808
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
It's so beautiful.

809
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
So the entire...

810
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,560
What? A random truck?

811
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,560
Yeah.

812
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,560
Who has their license?

813
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,560
Not me.

814
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Not me.

815
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,560
I mean, kind of, for certain vehicles.

816
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
Oh.

817
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,560
These vehicles.

818
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,560
The Carvys?

819
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,560
I've got an achievement.

820
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Boat, tractor.

821
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
Whoa.

822
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
This basically is like a tractor.

823
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,560
I can't get out of it.

824
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
For me.

825
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
I got a license.

826
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
Okay.

827
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
Oh, shit.

828
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,600
It's literally you driving.

829
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
Oh, my God.

830
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Yes.

831
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
We look like we're like...

832
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
I forgot the word.

833
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,600
I'm not good in English.

834
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
We're farmers.

835
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Joy ride.

836
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Very nice.

837
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Don't be scared, guys.

838
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,640
Back it up.

839
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,640
Is it fast enough?

840
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Oh, there's gas.

841
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,640
I'm a great driver.

842
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,640
We're sitting like we did something bad

843
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,640
and we got grounded.

844
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,640
We're like, we're sorry, Mom and Dad.

845
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,640
We didn't mean...

846
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,640
Yeah, exactly.

847
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,640
This is going to the Dr. Phil Ranch.

848
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,640
What was those accusations?

849
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,640
What was those kids getting?

850
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,640
We're going to the ranch.

851
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,640
We're going to the ranch.

852
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,680
Send you to the ranch.

853
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,680
You never doubted me.

854
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,680
That was amazing.

855
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
You got your license, we never doubted.

856
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,680
You really did get your license.

857
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,680
We touched the weekend.

858
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,680
A new hand has touched the weekend.

859
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,680
Okay, so like, what the fuck?

860
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,680
Right, so I see...

861
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,680
What?

862
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,680
Yeah, it turns and you move.

863
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,680
So you have to jump around.

864
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,680
As it's spinning, yeah, I have to jump around.

865
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,680
Like, jump onto the next flat surface.

866
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,720
It consistently spins.

867
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,720
One, two...

868
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Does it consistently spin left?

869
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,720
No.

870
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
It spins every three seconds.

871
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Like, spin one, two, three...

872
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,720
We'll take a side each.

873
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,720
No?

874
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,720
Wait, we can grab on like monkeys.

875
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,720
It's a grab one.

876
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,720
Oh.

877
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,720
Did we just go for it?

878
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,720
Just go for it.

879
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Grab.

880
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,760
No, it's not grab like monkeys at all.

881
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,760
You can grab.

882
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,760
Just jump when it changes the corner.

883
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,760
Okay, it's like playing skip.

884
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,760
We're a hop, skipping away.

885
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,760
Drag me up, drag me up, drag me up.

886
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
It's okay, it's okay.

887
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Oh, so close.

888
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,760
No, no, no.

889
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Oh my god, oh my god.

890
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
Okay, there's two of us up.

891
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
We're dead.

892
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Sorry, but we're actually such a dream team.

893
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
We're making so much progress.

894
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,800
I don't care what anyone says.

895
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,800
That was quite clutch.

896
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,800
A little bit of Mario Kart.

897
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
Super Mario.

898
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
Yeah, the car was good.

899
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Okay, water.

900
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,800
What's going on?

901
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Jump on one and then go on the next one.

902
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,800
Yeah.

903
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I thought we could just do it from here.

904
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,800
I just take my buddy with me.

905
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
That's fine.

906
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,800
There we go.

907
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,840
Wait, come here.

908
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,840
Oh.

909
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,840
Hello.

910
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,840
Hello.

911
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
Hello.

912
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,840
Guys, we're in touch.

913
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,840
By chance.

914
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,840
There we go.

915
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Oh, it slipped.

916
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,840
Why does it not?

917
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
Oh, right, well, it's fine.

918
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
No, no, just launch.

919
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,840
Okay, okay, okay.

920
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,840
And you come, and you come.

921
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,880
Okay.

922
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

923
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Oh, there we go.

924
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,880
Wait, I'm out for you guys.

925
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,880
Oh.

926
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,880
You can climb, you can climb.

927
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,880
You can fly, you can fly.

928
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,880
Come on.

929
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,880
Why?

930
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,880
It never lets me pull you up properly.

931
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,880
Whoa.

932
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,880
I complained about it and it worked.

933
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,880
Yeah, exactly.

934
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,880
See, all your problems are solved by complaining out loud.

935
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
Yes, your problems right now.

936
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
Oh, false.

937
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,920
Oh, no, no, no, no.

938
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,920
We got this, we got this.

939
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
If it'll let you up.

940
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Oh, hold on.

941
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,920
I don't know why it won't let me up, please.

942
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,920
Am I pulling?

943
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,920
We're both pulling.

944
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,920
Let me climb.

945
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Hold on, right, we're down.

946
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Why?

947
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
Am I even fucking pulling?

948
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,920
What am I doing?

949
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,960
I don't think so.

950
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,960
I don't know if the game's bugging out for Mismo.

951
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,960
She's like, you're falling.

952
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,960
Yeah, like flying.

953
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,960
And then I fell.

954
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,960
I'm trying to pull you up.

955
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,960
Oh, no.

956
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,960
There we go.

957
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,960
Standing in these paths, I feel like I slip off all the time.

958
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,960
Oh.

959
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,960
Here it comes.

960
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,960
How can I make it worse?

961
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,960
I'm making this so much worse.

962
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Everyone climb up and then go on that first platform thing.

963
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Because the game is not having it with Mismo right now.

964
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It hates you.

965
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It literally hates you.

966
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh, no.

967
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And now, Amy, it won't let me pull you.

968
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
There we go.

969
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Right, okay, we're going to stay on this platform

970
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
until we're ready to jump up, okay?

971
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
We're going to line up like good little frogs.

972
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Okay, all in a row.

973
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Four little frogs ready to hop in.

974
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Three, two, one.

975
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Under this platform.

976
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Oh, shit, my head.

977
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,040
What the fuck?

978
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,040
Can I grab?

979
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,040
I'll say three frogs.

980
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,040
Thank you.

981
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,040
Okay, okay.

982
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,040
Four little frogs ready to hop

983
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,040
in.

984
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,040
Three, two, one.

985
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,040
Oh.

986
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,040
I'm so freaking short.

987
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,040
What the hell?

988
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,040
I'm short.

989
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,040
My model got to be short.

990
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,040
Okay, no, this one.

991
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,080
No, this one, next one, next one.

992
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,080
Okay.

993
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,080
And there's four little frogs

994
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,080
waiting on the wall.

995
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,080
They're going to jump up

996
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,080
like hip-hop.

997
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
Jump!

998
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,080
Thanks for my model is short.

999
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,080
I jumped.

1000
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,080
There we go.

1001
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,080
One more, one more.

1002
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,080
Look at all I did.

1003
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,080
Okay, proof that frogs are awesome.

1004
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,080
We love it here.

1005
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,120
I'm always in money.

1006
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,120
Okay, that's actually a rather big jump.

1007
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,120
So I think we need to go back on this platform

1008
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,120
and jump over with it.

1009
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,120
No, you can make it.

1010
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,120
I think.

1011
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,120
Yeah.

1012
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,120
Go, go, go, please.

1013
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,120
Ta-da!

1014
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,120
Very good, very good.

1015
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,120
Okay, now we have the pillars

1016
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,120
of the Colosseum.

1017
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,120
Okay, right.

1018
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Well, I guess just three, two, one.

1019
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,160
Three, two, one.

1020
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,160
All right.

1021
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,160
Three, two, one.

1022
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,160
No, wait, wait.

1023
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
Oh, no!

1024
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,160
I wasn't.

1025
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Easy, easy.

1026
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Steady.

1027
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Oh, no.

1028
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Can you get up?

1029
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,160
The pool mechanic in this game.

1030
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,160
Oh, shit.

1031
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,160
I walked backwards as I was pulling.

1032
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,160
Okay, we managed, we managed.

1033
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
Okay.

1034
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
Are we ready?

1035
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Three, two, one.

1036
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Oh!

1037
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Okay, that was a better one.

1038
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
Okay, three, two, one.

1039
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
Wait, are we going the right way?

1040
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,200
We're going down instead of up.

1041
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
Oh, no, we're going the right way.

1042
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
No, this is correct. This is all right.

1043
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Yeah, it's just dipping and then we go back up.

1044
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
Three, two, one.

1045
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Ah.

1046
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,200
No, don't worry, don't worry.

1047
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,240
I got it, I got it.

1048
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,240
I'm good.

1049
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
Three, two, one.

1050
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
Okay, we're actually.

1051
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,240
Three, two, one.

1052
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,240
Very good.

1053
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,240
It's just regular jumping at this point.

1054
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,240
Yeah.

1055
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,240
That seems rather...

1056
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,240
That's a big one.

1057
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,240
Three, two, one.

1058
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,240
That looks pretty regular.

1059
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,240
Yeah, I don't really need to do a countdown for these jumps.

1060
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,280
Yeah, I don't really need to do a countdown for these jumps.

1061
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
Yeah, yeah.

1062
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,280
This one's like a hate jump.

1063
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,280
That one's okay.

1064
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
Oh, god, fucking damn it.

1065
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
God damn it being from Europe.

1066
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,280
No!

1067
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
The ping.

1068
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,280
It says my ping is 400 on top.

1069
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,280
It says 400 in...

1070
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,280
Where does this say?

1071
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,280
What number does it say?

1072
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
For me, it's 3984.

1073
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,320
Oh, mine's 3942.

1074
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,320
Guys, guys, that's how far up we are in me.

1075
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
We're dumbasses.

1076
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Oh, my god.

1077
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
Don't include me in that wee, guys.

1078
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
I'm the only one who's told you.

1079
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
That's embarrassing.

1080
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
I'm the only one who's told you, okay?

1081
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
That's not me. I'm not part of this.

1082
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
That's embarrassing.

1083
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
Don't listen to our thing.

1084
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,320
It's literally horrible.

1085
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
Anyway, back to the claiming.

1086
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
Yes, the claiming.

1087
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,360
Right. We'll do a three, two, one.

1088
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,360
Okay.

1089
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,360
Three, two, one.

1090
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,360
That was definitely

1091
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,360
a critical moment.

1092
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,360
I think that's just a jump.

1093
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,360
Oh, no.

1094
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,360
Before we jump on the trampoline, can I do something real quick?

1095
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,360
My V-Tube is lagging a little bit.

1096
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,360
Yeah, of course.

1097
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,360
I can't believe I thought that was ping.

1098
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,360
So 396 years ago.

1099
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,360
Oh, I genuinely thought that was ping.

1100
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,360
Yeah, yeah.

1101
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,400
Yeah, that's quite...

1102
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,400
How many meters is that above sea level?

1103
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,400
Isn't that a thing?

1104
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Oh, are we under sea level?

1105
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
Oh, like, there's...

1106
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
I'm looking ahead

1107
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
and there's moving lasers above.

1108
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Just let you guys should know.

1109
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
Like, way up there.

1110
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
I don't even know if we're going to reach the...

1111
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
You know, I have a feeling that, like,

1112
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
okay, don't take this the wrong way,

1113
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
but, like, in...

1114
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,400
I feel like I'm built with a big chain on it.

1115
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
Like, do it with people you really care about.

1116
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,440
Yeah.

1117
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,440
I wouldn't do it with, like, a stranger or anything like that.

1118
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,440
I think that would...

1119
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,440
Yeah, no, that would be a really good, like, sleepover.

1120
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,440
Whenever we get in the VNU off-collab,

1121
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,440
where you're all chained together, come on.

1122
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,440
We're waiting on a...

1123
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,440
We've had the VNU off-collab

1124
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,440
where DK quite literally showers me.

1125
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,440
Aw.

1126
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,440
Aw.

1127
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,440
She showered me.

1128
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
Wait, was it wholesome or was it...

1129
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,480
I was really...

1130
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,480
I was really drunk.

1131
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,480
I was really, really drunk,

1132
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,480
and she didn't want me to sleep in our shared bed

1133
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,480
with my clothes that I've been wearing,

1134
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,480
so she was like, going to shower.

1135
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,480
I was like, I can't shower, I'm drunk.

1136
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,480
So she showered me.

1137
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,480
Aw, that's kind of...

1138
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,480
Everyone needs a friend that will help you

1139
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,480
shower when you're drunk this night.

1140
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,480
Let's play.

1141
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,480
I like how she was like,

1142
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,480
you're not coming into the bed with those dirty clothes.

1143
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
I'm like, like, mom and I'm dad.

1144
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,520
Aw.

1145
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,520
That's so sweet.

1146
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,520
Okay.

1147
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Yeah.

1148
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,520
How are we doing, Acty?

1149
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,520
It's better.

1150
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,520
It's better?

1151
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,520
Yeah.

1152
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,520
Is it?

1153
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,520
That giggle didn't seem so sure.

1154
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,520
Well, let's say the game

1155
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,520
is killing your stream.

1156
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,520
It's a game.

1157
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,560
I'm not lagging unless

1158
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,560
the thing is open.

1159
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,560
I thought my V2 was open,

1160
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,560
and then I de-tab from the game

1161
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,560
for moving fine.

1162
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,560
Wait, wait, wait.

1163
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,560
You might want to put your...

1164
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,560
This can help.

1165
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,560
You might want to put the game as, like, window

1166
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,560
instead of full screen.

1167
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,560
Yeah.

1168
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,560
Yeah, that could help.

1169
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,560
And also if you use...

1170
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,560
Spote too?

1171
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
I'm not sure you use display,

1172
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,600
like, it'll be as you use...

1173
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,600
I hate the source before you put on.

1174
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Yeah, no.

1175
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
I'm not going to put display.

1176
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,600
I'm going to, like, dox myself.

1177
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Yeah, definitely.

1178
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,600
Oh, right. Or window.

1179
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,600
Because then it still captures the game,

1180
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,600
but not, you know.

1181
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,600
Yeah.

1182
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
Window takes less than game?

1183
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,600
I believe so.

1184
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,600
I could be stupid, but...

1185
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,640
No, at least I'm going to do that then.

1186
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,640
Well, it's a little probable.

1187
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,640
I have no idea.

1188
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,640
Yeah, that I don't know.

1189
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,640
That is display.

1190
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,640
When was the last guy...

1191
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,640
No, last time you guys were actually

1192
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,640
on the trampoline.

1193
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,640
Oh, gosh.

1194
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,640
See?

1195
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,640
That's a loaded question.

1196
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,640
I had a childhood friend

1197
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,640
that had a trampoline,

1198
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,680
and I jumped on it.

1199
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,680
My tail...

1200
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,680
My tailbone

1201
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,680
always used to hurt

1202
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,680
because I think I broke it.

1203
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,680
You know, I can't remember.

1204
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,680
There's, like, a really tiny bone

1205
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,680
at your tailbone,

1206
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,680
and it cracks really easily,

1207
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,680
and I think that unironically broke it.

1208
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,680
Yeah, I know, because my mum broke it.

1209
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,680
Yeah, I think I did that

1210
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,680
on the trampoline,

1211
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,680
and I'm scared of trampolines now,

1212
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,720
like, oh, no.

1213
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,720
I used to get scared of,

1214
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,720
like, because depending on the trampoline,

1215
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,720
have you ever seen the big rectangle ones?

1216
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,720
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,720
My cousin had that one,

1218
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,720
and I used to get scared of, like,

1219
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,720
jumping and landing in between

1220
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,720
where the springs were.

1221
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,720
And I remember, because I landed

1222
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,720
in...I landed my leg

1223
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,720
through one of the gaps,

1224
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,720
and, like, it cut.

1225
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,720
Because it's obviously metal.

1226
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,760
I'm, like, always, like, terrified to jump on them again.

1227
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,760
Aww.

1228
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,760
I feel like I just asked

1229
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,760
a very insensitive question somehow.

1230
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,760
What, but a trampoline?

1231
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,760
Yeah.

1232
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,760
No, not at all.

1233
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,760
It's even like everyone has some panic.

1234
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,760
Oh, really?

1235
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,760
It means I feel bad.

1236
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,760
I like trampolines.

1237
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,760
But now the trampolines, like,

1238
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,760
they're all safe now, so it's better.

1239
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,760
Yeah.

1240
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
I was on one, like...

1241
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
I don't have one,

1242
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,800
but I think the last time I was on one

1243
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,800
was maybe, like, two years ago.

1244
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
I did gymnastics for, like, the longest time.

1245
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Oh!

1246
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,800
That's cool.

1247
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
I quit because I'm getting old.

1248
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
There's the hockey ball.

1249
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,800
No. Retiring.

1250
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
That's actually better. Thank you so much.

1251
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
I didn't know. Oh, my God.

1252
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
I've been streaming for four years.

1253
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,800
I didn't know that.

1254
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,840
I've been streaming for three weeks.

1255
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,840
But that's true.

1256
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
I'm three years old.

1257
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
Baby.

1258
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
Yes, baby.

1259
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,840
Are we ready?

1260
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
Actually, the longest time we're ready,

1261
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,840
we go to the big rock, right?

1262
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Yeah.

1263
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,840
I'll come to the side.

1264
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,840
Three, two, one, go.

1265
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,840
Three, two, one.

1266
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,840
Actually...

1267
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
Never mind.

1268
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,880
Wait, I was not ready, and I'm the one on it.

1269
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,880
Anyway, let's go.

1270
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,880
Don't worry, I'm pulling, pulling, pulling.

1271
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,880
Okay.

1272
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,880
We did it anyway. We did it anyway.

1273
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,880
Yeah, that's fun.

1274
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,880
We just won anyway.

1275
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,880
So we gotta wait until these line up in the middle.

1276
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,880
And just run.

1277
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,880
I know how it lines up.

1278
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,880
I assume we just sprint across when it lines up.

1279
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,880
Yeah, so we have to start

1280
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,920
as it's about to form the bridge.

1281
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,920
We have to start on the left side, then.

1282
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,920
We have to start on the left side.

1283
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,920
Not this one, not this one.

1284
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,920
Next one.

1285
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,920
And then it's sprint, shift to sprint.

1286
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,920
Three, two, one, go.

1287
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,920
And then sprint, sprint, sprint.

1288
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,920
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

1289
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,920
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it.

1290
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,920
I almost had it.

1291
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,920
Don't give up.

1292
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,920
I can't believe the whole premise

1293
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,920
of this game being chained together

1294
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,920
was our demise. I can't believe it.

1295
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,920
We have a chance, we have a chance, we have a chance.

1296
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,920
Do we?

1297
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1298
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,920
And now what?

1299
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,920
Now what?

1300
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,920
On the right.

1301
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,920
We're gonna rotate around with it.

1302
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,920
We're gonna rotate around with it.

1303
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,920
A little too early but I like the enthusiasm.

1304
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,920
I like the enthusiasm.

1305
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,920
No way.

1306
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,920
Yeah, no.

1307
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,920
Yeah, real game or move right there.

1308
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,920
That was very...

1309
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,920
That's fine, you did it.

1310
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,920
Oh, I know, we should wait.

1311
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,920
I think we gotta wait again.

1312
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,920
These will disappear.

1313
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,920
So, I think, yeah.

1314
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,920
Whoever's at the end should...

1315
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,920
Johnny, go for it.

1316
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,920
Like, I'll go first though.

1317
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,920
Yeah.

1318
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,920
Wait till it disappears and then act these steps on it.

1319
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
Uh-huh.

1320
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,920
And then we just sprint for it.

1321
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,920
I'm on it? Yeah.

1322
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,920
Yeah, it's when you get off but we have to...

1323
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,920
Yeah, it's when you get off so wait for Johnny's signal.

1324
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,920
I'm ready when you are.

1325
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,920
I'm ready when you are.

1326
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,920
Yep.

1327
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,920
Send...

1328
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,920
When you're ready.

1329
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,920
I say go or...

1330
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1331
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,920
They go.

1332
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,920
Wait, I think you have to step up.

1333
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,920
Step again?

1334
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Okay, I'm stepping on it right now.

1335
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1336
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Shift, make sure you're holding shift.

1337
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,920
Make sure you're holding shift so you're running.

1338
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,920
Try to avoid claiming if you can.

1339
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,920
Avoid the claiming.

1340
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,920
Ah, shit.

1341
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,920
Yeah.

1342
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,920
Oh my god, I'm like claiming but...

1343
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,920
Stop claiming.

1344
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,920
I think we're okay, I think we're okay.

1345
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,920
Don't wanna...

1346
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,920
Go, go, go!

1347
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,920
Okay, okay, okay.

1348
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,920
I'm sorry, I screamed.

1349
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,920
Let's go!

1350
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,920
This way, this way.

1351
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,920
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1352
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,920
Ready?

1353
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
Yeah.

1354
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,920
Ring around the rosy.

1355
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,920
The pocket full of posies.

1356
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,920
A tissue, a tissue.

1357
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,920
We all fall down.

1358
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,920
Apparently it's about the black plague in Europe.

1359
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,920
It's okay, I'm gonna play with them.

1360
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,920
Oh.

1361
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,920
Okay, are we ready?

1362
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,920
I wanna just jump, we just gotta learn.

1363
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,920
Yeah, just the 3, 2, 1 jump on this one.

1364
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,920
Yeah.

1365
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,920
3, 2, 1, yeah!

1366
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,920
Whee!

1367
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,920
3, 2, 1, yahoo!

1368
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,920
We're like Mario and Johnny.

1369
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,920
Mario and Johnny.

1370
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,920
Okay, this one's a bit big

1371
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,920
but I think we'll manage, right?

1372
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,920
3, 2, 1, whee!

1373
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,920
Beautiful stunning gorgeous 10 out of 10.

1374
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,920
Love it.

1375
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,920
Let's go!

1376
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,920
Let's go!

1377
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,920
We got another lift.

1378
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,920
Whee!

1379
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,920
I love elevators.

1380
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Oh, it's already going up.

1381
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,920
Whee!

1382
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,920
Very, very good.

1383
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,920
This is so nice.

1384
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,920
What happens if we all kiss and change?

1385
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,920
We pissed.

1386
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,920
Oh, this is where I got up too.

1387
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,920
Yeah, this is like the checkpoint you did.

1388
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
Yeah.

1389
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,920
Oh, there's bats.

1390
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,920
Yeah.

1391
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,920
Oh, I'm getting stuck.

1392
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,920
So this is unfamiliar territory for me.

1393
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,920
I don't know where to go from here.

1394
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,920
Oh, so nice.

1395
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,920
It looks safe.

1396
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,920
Question mark.

1397
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,920
It kinda gives me like Skyrim crypt vibes.

1398
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,920
Ah, yeah.

1399
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,920
We swim?

1400
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,920
Well, I am a water type beacher.

1401
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,920
I don't know about you, but I'm water type.

1402
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,920
So...

1403
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,920
Oh, we have to go underneath.

1404
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,920
Oh, can we drown? I hope not.

1405
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,920
Oh, well, I mean, we're already dead.

1406
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,920
True.

1407
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,920
No, you got...

1408
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,920
Yeah.

1409
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,920
That was cute.

1410
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,920
We had a bit of a bath.

1411
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,920
What was that? Oh my god.

1412
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,920
Boss fight.

1413
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,920
It feels like Elden Knight.

1414
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,920
Is it close to you? Yeah.

1415
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,920
Dark Souls boss...

1416
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,920
HP shows up.

1417
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,920
Oh, so the HP bar spawns in...

1418
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,920
We're being very upset.

1419
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,920
So it says yes, you can drown.

1420
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,920
Well...

1421
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,920
Oh, okay. Well, we...

1422
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,920
We didn't drown.

1423
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,920
We died twice.

1424
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,920
Yeah, we didn't even drown.

1425
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,920
We're gonna die square.

1426
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,920
I don't...

1427
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,920
I don't think...

1428
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,920
Oh...

1429
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,920
Hmm...

1430
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,920
Okay.

1431
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,920
I'm laking it so far.

1432
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,920
Oh, Angel Wing!

1433
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,920
Wait, come...

1434
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,920
Are you scared by Angel Wing?

1435
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,920
Oh, Angel Wing's.

1436
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,920
Yeah, yeah, let's get it.

1437
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,920
Whee!

1438
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,920
You'll be for longer glades when you fall.

1439
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,920
Oh...

1440
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,920
So you could try to like save your jump, I guess.

1441
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:27,480
save your jump I guess. Why are we there's buttons over there? Where? Take a follow. We

1442
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:34,920
follow you Ms. Muxay. Oh, oh, you mean there's really big a red light. I wonder if we have

1443
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:41,080
to coordinate to hit it? There's another button up. There's other button. There's four button.

1444
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,880
I think maybe we need to like light them up. This one here or up. Oh yeah we do but the

1445
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:51,560
other one over there is also not yours so we should probably go get that one. There's

1446
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:58,200
that one here. Someone up here? Oh yeah. Hold on. No, I'll kill you. Yeah, I'm cheesy dude

1447
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:06,840
alone. I'm just filling you up. Help me. Ah, I missed my note. Help me. Thank you. Oh no,

1448
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:13,640
because I was walking backwards trying to pull. Okay, wait. We can just jump for this one. Three,

1449
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:20,120
two, one, go. Yeah. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Then we'll just jump down. Three, two, one. Three,

1450
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:31,160
two, one. Okay, now what? Oh, crack. Is there? Oh. Once press the button. Thankfully that's

1451
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:39,800
our biggest enemy. Our biggest one is this. Right. Well, we can at least jump on like a

1452
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:46,680
like a roll. Okay, three. I think time it. Yeah. We can jump on this and one go right. Three,

1453
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:53,560
two, one. Spider time. Okay, great. No. I mean, we can go one and one, right?

1454
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:03,640
That is true. I don't think the chain is gonna. Okay. Stawning? Yeah. Oh yeah, okay. Okay. I

1455
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:12,600
thought you were going to get hit. No, no, no, no. Right. We're not. This one. This one. Go, go, go.

1456
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:20,200
I will have time. I will have time. That's okay. That's okay. Come through here now. Yeah, that's good.

1457
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:27,640
This one's going to be way harder. Wait, careful. Up, up, up. Go, get up, get up. Oh yeah, good call. Good

1458
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:35,880
call. Oh wait, we can. Okay, we just need to go a little to the left. Wait, wait, wait. We can

1459
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:41,560
just jump. Wait, wait, wait. Look, look, look, look. Come to the left, actually. Just, just, we'll

1460
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:47,480
all start climbing. Yeah. And then we'll push to the left. Okay. Right. Three. Oh, well, yeah, okay.

1461
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:58,200
Well, I was going to take it. Oh, nice. Go, Timothy.

1462
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,360
Uh, Gameran's saying. Oh, I have not.

1463
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,720
No, no, no, no.

1464
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:25,080
Why does it do this? Yeah, oh, yeah, I pulled myself up. Okay. Okay. Easy, PZ, 11. We have a lot of

1465
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:31,080
upper body strength to be pulling each other like that. Yeah, right. Very ripped. Okay. We still need

1466
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,480
to kill, but we have to do it on our own. I think this is a gamer instinct one because I think I

1467
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:41,160
can't count this for paying, so. No, I think you have to count it and then we see our first opening

1468
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:47,560
since that end of the count. Uh, I think we can do like it's going to be different for everyone,

1469
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,800
but like as soon as you said go, we're going to look for the first one. Okay, so just as a

1470
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:57,880
rotate one, two, three, four, and then we'll go on the fourth rotation. Does that make sense? I'll

1471
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:06,680
say the rotation twice. Is that or should we just gamer instinct it? I want a gamer instinct.

1472
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:13,880
Three, two, one. Can you go? Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, then we're overthinking it.

1473
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:20,520
Oh, what the hell? Okay. You slipped, PZ, 11, PZ. I slipped? I don't know. For me, I'm ice cream now,

1474
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:27,240
it's just crazy. Okay, we have to go on a carousel, which we'll jump on. And then just jump over

1475
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:35,720
the lasers. We're gonna need to go to the one that's coming here, right? This one? This one? This one?

1476
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:41,240
I guess so. I mean, it's just because I don't think, I don't think the one we were on was about to.

1477
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,920
Big jump, big jump. Gamer instinct it. There's no tamer on this one. Oh, shit. No, that wasn't me.

1478
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,640
That wasn't me. That wasn't me. I'm sorry. Okay. Did we get the car again? I want to read the car.

1479
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:59,640
Whoa. Oh, that's going to water again. That's fun. Oh, wait, can the checkpoint take us to the top?

1480
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:07,560
I think so. I think so. I'll fill the check. I just wanted to swim. We will. Oh, cheeky swimming.

1481
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:14,360
Oh, there we go. There we go. Easy. Yeah. Well, we can't be ready, but yeah, this is definitely

1482
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:19,960
gamer instinct one because I can't tame the lasers the way it can be done, but we can at least jump

1483
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:24,280
on this. Yeah.

1484
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,040
Ready, go.

1485
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,440
Okay. Surely we won't mess up twice in a row.

1486
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,080
Lovely. Right. Where do we go tonight? Oh, here, here.

1487
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:50,280
Oh, this one, this one. Is this going to be close enough? What? Go, go, go. Isn't it? Isn't it that?

1488
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:57,560
Oh, I think so. I'm pulling and trying not to fall off it. I think we had to go at...

1489
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:06,360
Hold on. I am pulling you. I am. I have the idea. Hold S, I think, to like swim back.

1490
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,640
All right. Oh. No, Ms. Must teaching us this like an hour and... Okay, hold on. Jump. Get ready to

1491
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:25,160
jump, Amy. I totally forgot about that. It's so good from my POV. As I, I mean, I mean, you're

1492
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:29,800
butt, you're butt, Amy. You're butt, you're butt, you're bodacious butt, Amy. You're tishy.

1493
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:38,760
I know where. No, we are definitely, Ms. Mom was right. We are supposed to jump on

1494
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,880
that third one. It looks like the distance is going to make it, but we must have faith.

1495
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,840
We have faith in the demoness. She knows what she's doing. She lives here, okay?

1496
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:57,160
Ah, yes. I live here. Why? Yes, of course. It should be coming around. Yep. I'm getting ready.

1497
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:03,080
Nice to come here during that. Three, two, one. Oh, I missed. I missed. No, no, it's okay. The way,

1498
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:09,400
the way, the way. Okay. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Lovin' it. The way. I got you. I got

1499
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:15,640
you. Stunning. Okay, there is a... Oh, we missed her. Okay. We are going to have to just go around.

1500
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,840
We are going to have to jump around this. Don't worry, we got it. Yeah, we got it.

1501
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:24,360
Gameran. If you're stuck. Stop it, tips. You're taunting me.

1502
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,920
It's like, it keeps it. If you're stuck, press near safe location. Give us a chance,

1503
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:36,600
okay? Give us a chance. Yeah, I gotta try first. Oh, wait, the ass is right there.

1504
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:43,960
Yeah, and the, the, it's very, um, uh, very calm, calm down. The glue is maximum.

1505
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,840
Okay, we gotta jump this next one too. Yes, yes, yes. Ready? Remember, we can just push through

1506
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:55,720
this. Yeah. And then we get off of the platform. We've got three achievements.

1507
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,720
I think it's open here. Yeah, just then we're out.

1508
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,320
There was 16 achievements in this game. So if we have three achievements so far,

1509
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:21,880
by my calculations, we're like, I don't know. Ish done. Like, okay. Do we need to tame this,

1510
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,920
or can we just go for it? I think I can just go for it. Yeah, I think there's enough space between.

1511
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:36,200
Unless, unless, unless. I think it's the chain that's like, ooh, mess up. Okay. I don't know how

1512
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:41,560
I've managed this, but I made it worse. I've made it terribly worse. Everything. Wait, I,

1513
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:50,520
don't wait. I got it. I got it. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. We keep falling off.

1514
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:56,200
We keep falling off, man. We fell though. Oh, good grief. I wonder what hidden,

1515
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:03,400
there must be so many hidden secrets in this game that. No. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Right. That's okay.

1516
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:08,120
No, you're right. I can grieve the loss of our progress later. Right now we gotta make progress.

1517
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:22,440
Uh, right. Okay. One gamer instinct. Yeah. That's all right. The gamer extent was a gaming.

1518
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,160
The gamer, I can't believe it. I can't believe you're, I can't believe you didn't come out of the

1519
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:33,000
womb holding an Xbox 360 controller. They're just shocking behavior, shocking behavior.

1520
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:40,920
I can't believe you're, when your mum gets like a belly scan and you're holding like a Gameboy

1521
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:49,480
advanced in your hands, I can't believe it's just shocking. It's the new gen just not made like

1522
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:56,520
out there. No. Just don't make them like how they used to. Okay. Big jump. It doesn't look like we

1523
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:03,000
can make it, but we still can. Oh, okay. Well, it was a bit early. I was a bit early. I was a bit

1524
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:09,000
early. I was rather early on that one going to be honest. Oh, please. So I was on it, but the pool

1525
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:17,320
was too much. Jumping so early on that one. Stop it. I mean, we could probably shift for the

1526
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:24,920
specific one, but shift. By we, I mean me. I went, I went with you. Look, sorry. You know,

1527
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:29,720
would you jump if your friends jumped off a cliff? Would you jump? Oh, yes. I'm gone.

1528
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:34,840
Wee. I'm away. Me too. Okay.

1529
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,840
It's too easy. Please. They can't handle it.

1530
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:51,480
Then big jump. Gorgeous. Stunning. I love it. The master pieces coming together. Okay. We need to

1531
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:58,120
jump, but not, not too early. Oh, close enough. Close enough. Close enough. I'll take it. I'll take

1532
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,600
it. No, it's all good. I'm pulling. I'm pulling and pressing S at the same time.

1533
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:12,120
No, there may be a jump. Very good. There may be a jump very shortly. I think we're going to do

1534
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,320
right. We need to do the full rotation. So we do need jump.

1535
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:23,480
Wee. Gorgeous. 10 out of 10. Yeah.

1536
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:31,880
Now we can stare at S until we have to jump next. Oh, I love this part. It's my favorite.

1537
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,960
The highlight of the game. This is secretly the highlight of the game.

1538
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,560
I got two underscreen shots right now.

1539
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,560
I had no idea it was that close. I had no idea. I was in the opposite position. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1540
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,560
I have my tension into the ass.

1541
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:57,320
Distracted by booty cheeks. Oh, well, I was going to try and make a pun out of this.

1542
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,840
The word distract and ask, but it didn't really work. Uh, it's like going to be

1543
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:07,720
distracted. Yeah, you know what? Yeah. I can see the vision. Yeah, that's like a word.

1544
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:14,120
Okay. Now we are going to have. How did we fail last time? I think we were too far away from

1545
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,960
each other's chains. I think all of us just jump at the same time. We do the three, two, one thing.

1546
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,560
Yeah. Three, two, one.

1547
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:41,480
It's okay. It's just so small. I wonder is it too far that we

1548
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:47,800
like one by one? Is it too far if we do like one by one? No, I would say one by one should probably

1549
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:53,960
work because like if the chain is one by one, maybe not, but I think perhaps.

1550
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,040
This is a difficult one. Hold on. Everybody get close.

1551
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:05,400
Oh, shit. We made it. What's wrong with this jump?

1552
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:11,320
Hmm. I think if I jump first, we're falling all the way down in the bottom of the map.

1553
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:17,880
I think I was on it. That's on the edge of the chain needs to jump first because it needs to be a

1554
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,600
no pun intended chain reaction. I mean, look at all the progress we've made in general. So I'm not

1555
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:27,400
even mad. I'm not even mad. Sorry. We have a little swatch. Well, that would be terrifying to feel

1556
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,480
like the force of the air against you as you fall to the ground gently.

1557
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,960
Yeah. I mean, I mean, it didn't splat onto the floor. So it's gently.

1558
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:50,600
I would love falling from the sky. Are you being skydiving? I want to. I've done like paragliding.

1559
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,680
Oh, Paragliding. Wait, which one's paragliding?

1560
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:01,320
That's the one where it's like, it's like, it's not a plane, but like you just an air

1561
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,680
suit type thing in the bulb. Oh, with a parachute.

1562
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:10,600
With the air currents and that, like it can take you really far.

1563
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:19,160
Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, yeah. I don't know if y'all are pressing shift or not, but shift

1564
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:25,240
makes you go further. So I press lunches. Oh, okay. I think I think Strani has to go first on

1565
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,200
that one. We keep failing because you're at the front of the chain. Yes. Yes, because I'm getting

1566
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,920
almost messed up. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm embarrassed.

1567
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,200
And then we go jump.

1568
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:52,440
Strani, Strani. I'm ready. I follow you. Three, two, one. Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm happy.

1569
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,280
Okay. We're good. We're good. We're good. We've got big, big jump. Oh, here, here, here.

1570
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,800
Big jump. Well, it's actually not as big as that other one. This one's a lot easier. Oh,

1571
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:07,720
the pole. The pole. Please. Will someone think of the pole? The galvanized steel beams. Please get

1572
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:15,240
out of my face. Galvanized steel beams. Oh, literally. Are you borrowed from your auntals?

1573
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,680
Okay. One at a time. Wait, wait, wait. The order of the thing. Wait. Okay. Wait, it's right. Yeah.

1574
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:29,320
And edging gently. Edging gently. We did. So when we all jumped on, we just make sure you press

1575
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:34,680
spacebar when you jump as well to grab onto the log. That's what I'm saying. It's like,

1576
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:41,080
is it too far if we jump one by one? I think we can all jump together and just hold on to the log.

1577
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,920
No, because like the climbing space won't be enough for all of us, I don't think. See?

1578
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,400
Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, you're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. Right. One more

1579
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,880
try and if we don't do it, we're rage quitting. That's all I'm saying. I know my blood pressure

1580
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:02,760
isn't artificially raised higher than it normally is right now, but that's because I'm a gamer. I want

1581
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:08,680
to win. But I'm not going to, I'm not going to torture these lovely girls that have agreed to

1582
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:14,360
collab with me via gameplay, via gameplay of the same thing over. Do you know what the definition

1583
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:20,600
of insanity is? The definition of insanity. Repeating the same thing over and over again.

1584
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:25,320
I'm not going to force it. I'm not going to force it. I like insanity.

1585
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:31,960
Are you mad scientist apparently? I was doing a trick shot. I was just, I was just checking

1586
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:38,280
your pain tension. Okay. Miss, ma'am, Miss Captain. Three, two, one. Okay. I'm getting held back.

1587
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:47,240
I think we all need to jump at the same time. I'm getting. All right. One more chance. One more

1588
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:52,600
chance. I'm not addicted. I'm not addicted. Right. What we have to do is we all have to jump at the

1589
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,440
same time because when I leap forward, I get pulled back. If that makes sense, we do need to

1590
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,560
because then I just sometimes when I jump, it doesn't like I press this baseball, but this

1591
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,040
doesn't happen anywhere. Yeah.

1592
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:11,640
Okay. All together. I heard that car horn. Right. Three, two, one.

1593
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:19,560
I always hit that pole. I got you. Thank you. Okay.

1594
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:26,920
Watch out. Oh, yeah. You did it. Okay. We all have to jump at the same time because it's not

1595
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:32,520
going to work. Okay. Three, two, one. Go. Oh, that was perfect. That was good. That was perfect.

1596
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:39,720
That was so juicy. That was so gorgeous. That was so five star Michelin. Oh, no, is it one?

1597
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,680
Oh, no, it is Michelin stars. Like how they made fancy food.

1598
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:50,120
Yeah. The fanciest food I've ever had is chicken burger and chips. That's what that's fancy.

1599
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:55,960
Chicken burger and chips. I've never tried like caviar or anything that's considered.

1600
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:03,400
No, me neither. I love caviar. Okay. This is it. This is the defining factor. If we reach

1601
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:10,760
quit or no, we're all going to group up. Okay. So it is one and one. Wait. Oh, one big jump together

1602
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:15,560
because we're pulling. It is because we pull too much. We can all jump on the log and grab it at

1603
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:21,160
the same time because we don't have clipping in this game. So I will count down and on go we jump

1604
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:27,800
or whenever I say we. Okay. All right. And we and you must grab the log. You must press space bar.

1605
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:37,400
Okay. Three, two, one. Grab that. It's stunning. Gorgeous. Exact same thing. We're going to do it.

1606
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:45,000
Right. Three, two, one. And then grab. We must grab the log. We must grab the log.

1607
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:57,400
Okay. Good job. Good job. Good job. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Easy. Edge the log. Edge the log.

1608
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:05,080
I hear something like a buzzing. That's just the log. Don't worry. The log's having a good time.

1609
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,880
Okay. I don't know the water. Why is the water squirting?

1610
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:21,800
Okay. Are we ready? Three, two, one. Go. And grab the log. Grab the log. Grab the log.

1611
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:25,560
I did it. I did it. We did it. We did it. Oh, my God. Yes.

1612
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,040
I was so stressed. Here we go. Break time. Break time. I need to breathe. Have a brief. We did it.

1613
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:40,840
Hydration check. Hydration check, gamers. Hydration. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it.

1614
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:45,640
We're doing it. Oh, my God. I was like, bro, we don't make this on region, but because we made it,

1615
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:50,040
I got another one in me. Chief, put me back in. Put me back in. I got another one.

1616
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,360
Well, I'm eating a bit of my food that went cold. Oh, no. Oh, no. What are you eating?

1617
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:03,080
Um, it's budak ramen. Oh, budak ramen.

1618
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:11,880
Budak ramen. It's like noodles. It's the carbonara ones, but I prepared it in a very specific way.

1619
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:23,400
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait. This is perfect. Actually, I bothered my members by sending them the exact

1620
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:33,000
way step by step how I do it. Oh, real and true. Here we go. Let's go. We have the secret recipe.

1621
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:39,160
I love keeping recipe as a cooking Vtuber. I never tried that. So first time I do budak,

1622
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:45,640
I might just do that one. Oh, please. Please. It's so good. I never had the budak.

1623
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:50,920
Okay, we will let you eat. Oh, I don't know what creme fraiche is.

1624
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:57,720
It can be like, uh, you can use like, I guess you can use sour cream as a substitute, but

1625
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:07,400
that wouldn't say so. Let me do it like a viewer check if people know what creme fraiche is.

1626
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:13,480
It's like, I don't think it's an Aussie thing. I don't think we have this in Australia.

1627
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,880
I don't know. I know that you're saying French right now. I understand the French,

1628
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:24,440
but is that just like, not whipping cream, but like cream? It's cream. It's not really because it's

1629
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:32,440
closer to sour cream. Like cream cheese or sour cream? Sour cream. It's smoother. Oh.

1630
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,720
Yeah, it's like, it's between sour cream and cream cheese.

1631
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:43,640
Mmm. Oh, okay. So it's like, okay, I see what you've done.

1632
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:47,800
Oh, it's so good. I'm like, I'm holding back. I'm like, I'm holding back.

1633
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,880
I'm sad it's gone cold for you though.

1634
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:59,080
Like it's gone cold now. That's okay. I'm not picky.

1635
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,920
Right, as long as it tastes good and it satisfies.

1636
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,520
I think I'm the least picky person ever.

1637
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,720
I could have a whole pizza fall on the floor. I do not care.

1638
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,840
Five second rule. That's real. You've extended it to 10 second rule.

1639
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:25,880
Right, I think. I'm sorry for making you guys sit here. No, you're fine. It's good to eat.

1640
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:31,560
We've got, I would say we've probably got another 10 minutes and then we'll see how far,

1641
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:37,480
but if we keep dying at something, I'm not going to hold you guys hostage any longer.

1642
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:38,200
I'm having fun.

1643
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,600
Yeah, give me a stretch whenever.

1644
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,640
Yeah, the hypnosis help is ready.

1645
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:46,920
Yeah.

1646
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:51,800
I'm glad they said like bulky.

1647
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:56,040
Okay. Well, just do the three, two, one, because this is the best method.

1648
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,400
It's not filled us so far. Okay. Three, two, one.

1649
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,880
Yeah, this is like literally the best method. I don't care.

1650
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,040
My name says I don't care if you're tired or listening to me saying it's working.

1651
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,120
Right. Three, two, one.

1652
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:16,280
Go. Oh, I've got a big say there. Okay. Very good. Three, two, one.

1653
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:16,440
Go.

1654
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,480
Three, two, one. Go.

1655
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,040
Nice night. Three, two, one. Go.

1656
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,680
I'm going to hear this in my dreams tonight.

1657
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,840
All right. Three, two, one. Go.

1658
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:38,280
Hey, we're gorgeous. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Three, two, one. Go.

1659
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:44,600
Yeah, I'll do it extra Scottish this time. Three, two, one. Go.

1660
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,880
Go, go, go. Three, two, one. Go.

1661
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,520
We're doing it in French now.

1662
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:55,320
Three, two, one. Go.

1663
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,600
That was a good French. No, congrats.

1664
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:12,680
Okay, we're going to do in Spanish next. We'll come up to the next, but for Spanish.

1665
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:19,560
Okay. Very nice. Okay, on the sword. I can sing my sword, sword.

1666
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:24,520
Oh, this is a big jump actually. Okay, maybe we'll do it in English because this is a bit of an

1667
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:31,000
awkward one. Okay. On the cross, we jump. Okay. Yeah. Three, two, one. Go.

1668
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:36,600
Oh, I didn't. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Hold on. I can pull you up. I can pull you up.

1669
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,280
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1670
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,760
Right. That's just a jump. That's not even how. That's not good.

1671
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,400
And then again, three, two, one.

1672
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,400
Whoops. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1673
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,720
Oh my God. It's literally us because there's four of us.

1674
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,880
Oh my God. What one are you? Tag you. Which one are you?

1675
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:11,720
I'm the one right there in the corner. I'm on my knees. Always.

1676
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,600
I'm standing. I'm standing at the back. I'm like standing in the back.

1677
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,680
I want to be the little gremlin on the...

1678
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,680
Okay. I'll be the first. I'll be like, come on, guys.

1679
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,640
Don't you want to play this game? What do you mean? It's really frustrating and people hate it.

1680
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,800
Well, come on, guys. Like, come on.

1681
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,800
Wait. Strongly. That means that our statue versions are literally ass to ass.

1682
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,440
Ass to ass. I don't mind if I do.

1683
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,000
I'm going to draw that.

1684
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,840
On his back to back.

1685
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,280
As to ass.

1686
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,120
Okay. We're going to wiggle. We're just going to wiggle.

1687
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,800
We don't need to jump. We don't need to do anything.

1688
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,840
That's less difficult than the bones, technically.

1689
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,680
Wiggle, wiggle. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

1690
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,840
I'm going to make you laugh and looking at us.

1691
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,800
Oh no.

1692
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,200
Bird's eye view going. Get that bird's eye view going.

1693
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:58,760
What?

1694
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,800
Oh, I'm turning. I'm apparently...

1695
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,280
I'm doing a 360 by accident. I don't know how I managed that one.

1696
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,320
Oh, easy. Easy.

1697
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:08,920
Steady.

1698
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:09,960
Steady.

1699
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,880
All right. We're good. We're good.

1700
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:14,040
Steady. Okay. Follow this and we'll...

1701
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,360
Easy. Easy.

1702
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,960
Slow and steady wins the race.

1703
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,320
Do you guys not know the turtle?

1704
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,800
The turtle? Is that the tortoise and the hare story?

1705
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:26,680
Tortoise and the hare?

1706
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:27,480
Oh, yeah.

1707
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,200
Yeah.

1708
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:32,600
That's right. The toy just won because he picked his thing.

1709
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,160
And it is a life story.

1710
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:38,760
I think it was while the hare was being cocky and thought he could beat the

1711
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,600
tortoise.

1712
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,560
There you are.

1713
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:43,000
Don't get too cocky, girls.

1714
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,120
You heard it.

1715
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,080
You heard it here first.

1716
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,040
Don't get too cocky.

1717
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:48,840
Don't get cocky.

1718
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,400
Are we almost there?

1719
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:51,960
Okay. Right.

1720
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,920
Okay. I needed to look ahead because I was like, bro, we've been on this.

1721
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,320
Yeah. I was like, when did the ride stop?

1722
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,600
I feel like we're playing Sonic Heroes.

1723
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,560
Do you know the rails?

1724
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,520
Yeah. Oh my God.

1725
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,040
Rail Canyon?

1726
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:05,000
Yes.

1727
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,080
Yeah. I hate that level.

1728
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:08,040
My favorite.

1729
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:09,720
I always fall off on it.

1730
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,480
Man, I fell off.

1731
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,880
Okay. Okay.

1732
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:14,920
That was superb.

1733
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,760
That was superb.

1734
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,040
I love when we're not in one.

1735
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:20,440
Oh, wait.

1736
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,120
This isn't...

1737
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:22,520
I don't like...

1738
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,720
I got maze.

1739
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:23,960
Okay.

1740
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:24,840
Mermaid time.

1741
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,240
Who won?

1742
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:25,560
Right.

1743
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,800
My mermaid power is...

1744
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,680
My one has a red tail.

1745
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,680
Maze got green tail.

1746
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,720
I have a orange tail.

1747
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,040
I want a mint tail.

1748
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,040
No, that's not true.

1749
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,880
I want a black tail.

1750
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,440
Oh, yeah.

1751
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,320
Hell, yeah.

1752
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,160
Right, mermaids.

1753
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:47,960
Are we ready?

1754
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,400
Are you saying you don't have mermaid powers?

1755
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:51,960
What?

1756
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,320
Oh, wait. Well, mermaid power?

1757
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:58,280
Okay. My power is I have an extra two fins to make me super agile in the water.

1758
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,880
I just wish that's my thing.

1759
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,880
I just want to talk to the fish.

1760
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,400
Oh, yeah, man.

1761
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,720
I'm a toxic mermaid.

1762
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,760
I'm a toxic mermaid.

1763
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,880
I make toxins.

1764
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:10,360
Oh.

1765
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:13,800
That's pretty cool.

1766
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,280
Oh, no.

1767
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,400
Cleo, the condensation.

1768
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,120
Cleo, no.

1769
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:16,600
I know her.

1770
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,160
I know her.

1771
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:18,280
No, no.

1772
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:19,480
The water.

1773
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:21,880
The condensation.

1774
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:27,160
Okay.

1775
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,600
We're ready to swim.

1776
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:29,160
Yes.

1777
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,280
Three, two, one.

1778
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,640
Just to remind you, we can drown.

1779
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:33,960
So let's keep her going.

1780
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,840
Let's keep her going.

1781
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:35,720
Little to the right.

1782
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,440
Little to the right.

1783
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,760
Gorgeous, stunning.

1784
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:39,560
Is this a dead end?

1785
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,320
Top right, top right, top right.

1786
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,200
Oh, sorry, crap.

1787
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,160
How do you, how do you go up?

1788
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:45,800
Is it space?

1789
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,760
You got to use your mouse.

1790
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:47,480
Aim with your mouse.

1791
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,320
Oh, wow.

1792
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:49,640
Okay.

1793
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,080
I think we have to go.

1794
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:51,880
We don't go for air.

1795
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,600
We should go for air.

1796
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:53,320
Yes, air, air, air.

1797
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:54,920
Oh, no, Amy's stuck.

1798
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:55,640
Amy's stuck.

1799
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,360
Amy's stuck.

1800
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,960
You stop pulling your, Amy's stuck.

1801
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,240
We're going to, you need to come back.

1802
01:46:59,240 --> 01:46:59,720
You need to come back.

1803
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,160
So Amy can come back up, up.

1804
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,560
And then we'll go for air, up.

1805
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,760
Yep, yep, yep, up.

1806
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,360
And then air, air, right, air, air.

1807
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:07,000
Did I come?

1808
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,920
Uh, hope not.

1809
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
How do you know if we're missing air?

1810
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:13,560
I'm just kidding.

1811
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,360
Okay.

1812
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,400
Okay, we got air.

1813
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:16,040
We got air.

1814
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,720
We got air.

1815
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,360
Right.

1816
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:19,480
Okay, so it's not there.

1817
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:20,840
Okay.

1818
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,360
There was another place.

1819
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,280
But how do y'all see if we're missing air?

1820
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,520
I'm starting to get it.

1821
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,280
And they just told us that we can drown.

1822
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:30,200
I believe in the reeflings.

1823
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:31,560
They speak the gospel truth.

1824
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,000
The gospel truth.

1825
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,040
Do you think we'll hear the drowning sound from Sonic

1826
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:37,720
if we stay under water long enough?

1827
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,360
Didi, didi, didi, didi, didi, didi, didi, didi, didi.

1828
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:40,600
Right.

1829
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,240
Okay.

1830
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,560
Three, two, one, mommy time.

1831
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:44,680
Okay.

1832
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,600
Now we take a left approach to this.

1833
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,040
Yeah.

1834
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,480
Yeah.

1835
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,320
Top left.

1836
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:51,880
Good.

1837
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,280
Okay.

1838
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,000
Uh-huh.

1839
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Is there, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1840
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,280
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1841
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:56,360
Oh yeah.

1842
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:58,120
Very nice.

1843
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,000
Tell us how you really feel.

1844
01:47:59,000 --> 01:47:59,880
Tell us how you really feel.

1845
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,040
Okay, we're going top right around this corner.

1846
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:02,840
Okay, we're going down.

1847
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,520
We're going down for just making, okay,

1848
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,240
Randall, Randall, Randall, Randall, and Randall.

1849
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,600
Yeah, that's the place.

1850
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,480
Yeah, that's okay.

1851
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:11,560
That's okay.

1852
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:11,640
That's the place.

1853
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:12,120
To the right.

1854
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,320
To the right.

1855
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:14,360
We're going back out.

1856
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,120
There's a top left here if we want to go.

1857
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,920
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1858
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,160
Here?

1859
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,760
Is it there?

1860
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:19,800
Uh, there?

1861
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,280
Up here.

1862
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,880
No, because now we're going back to the start.

1863
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:22,600
No, we're not.

1864
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,640
This isn't the start.

1865
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,120
We're not?

1866
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,080
Uh-huh.

1867
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:25,400
Okay.

1868
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:26,840
This is quite some reason.

1869
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,720
Oh, maybe it is the start.

1870
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,280
You know what?

1871
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,160
You know what, Ms. Ma?

1872
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:29,640
You know what?

1873
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,520
Maybe you are right.

1874
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,480
Maybe I'm bad.

1875
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,680
I think you're onto it.

1876
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,080
Oh, wait.

1877
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:33,960
Is this not the start?

1878
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,360
No.

1879
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:35,240
No, it's different.

1880
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:35,720
It's different.

1881
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,040
It's different.

1882
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:36,680
Oh, no.

1883
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,080
Oh, no.

1884
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,120
Oh, we're getting sucked.

1885
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:41,320
How?

1886
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:41,960
Oh.

1887
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:44,120
I think because it was like a hole with the,

1888
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,320
with the air.

1889
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:45,880
Oh, okay.

1890
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:46,680
Oh, what is this?

1891
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:46,920
Yeah.

1892
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:51,400
Wait, this is the first official checkpoint.

1893
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,920
If you don't use actual checkpoints, that's insane.

1894
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,360
Oh, that's messed up.

1895
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,680
That is brutal.

1896
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,840
Some people like punishing themselves on video games.

1897
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,280
I am not that kind of person.

1898
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,000
No.

1899
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,640
I would not tolerate that from a video game.

1900
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,360
Me neither.

1901
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,920
I prefer progression and stuff.

1902
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:11,640
Literally.

1903
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,600
Just like collabs.

1904
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:17,000
I rather just continue than streaming the same stuff.

1905
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,640
Like, I don't know.

1906
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,320
Okay.

1907
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:22,360
We've got 10 minutes.

1908
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,720
We'll see what we can do in 10 minutes.

1909
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,040
Okay?

1910
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:25,160
I mean, look up.

1911
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:25,640
Look up.

1912
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,160
We're close, aren't we?

1913
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:28,360
No.

1914
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,280
Look at us in the corner.

1915
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:32,360
We're at the first checkpoint out of three.

1916
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:32,760
I am.

1917
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,720
We're not.

1918
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,160
We ain't making a chief wing.

1919
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,920
We ain't making a life.

1920
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:39,960
Like, I need to, I thought we were close.

1921
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:40,840
I thought we were close.

1922
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,520
And then I look in the corner and I'm like, oh.

1923
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:44,520
I mean, look down.

1924
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,880
We've gotten quite a fort.

1925
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,200
Yeah.

1926
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,480
It is so big though.

1927
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,280
Like, that is so much more.

1928
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,320
I miss the car.

1929
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,520
Yeah.

1930
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,280
I want to go in.

1931
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,800
Give us another car sequence.

1932
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,040
No.

1933
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,240
Okay.

1934
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:56,520
Okay.

1935
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,160
I guess three to one jump because this is a big one.

1936
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,600
So we have to do it together.

1937
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah.

1938
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,080
Yeah.

1939
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:01,560
Yeah.

1940
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:02,680
Come close to us.

1941
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,080
Yeah.

1942
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:03,400
Okay.

1943
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,400
I'll do this.

1944
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:06,040
Three, two, one, go.

1945
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:06,280
All right.

1946
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,200
Three, two, one, go.

1947
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,840
That was a big one.

1948
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:11,240
We good?

1949
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:11,720
We good?

1950
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,920
That was very good.

1951
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,040
No, ankle's broken.

1952
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:15,880
Okay.

1953
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:18,440
Maybe some, an ankle may have been sprained,

1954
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:19,000
but that's okay.

1955
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,440
Spray it at least.

1956
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:21,000
Yeah.

1957
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:22,840
I saw AC hole on it.

1958
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,160
Why not?

1959
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,560
Oh wait, that's for muscles.

1960
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,720
Hold on a minute.

1961
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,680
I think Bob, I think you can put a hot thing.

1962
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,720
I'm starting my jump.

1963
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,840
I thought it looked okay.

1964
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:33,320
No worries.

1965
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:40,200
One of the reasons they are pinging has now gone to 500.

1966
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,120
Yeah, hardy hard hard.

1967
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,640
Oh, what is the mean?

1968
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,080
Oh yeah, the pings to 500.

1969
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:52,600
What is?

1970
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,400
Yeah, I'll ping.

1971
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,240
Wait, do we have to crouch?

1972
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:57,800
No, no, no.

1973
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,160
I think I, I think I get it.

1974
01:50:59,160 --> 01:50:59,320
Okay.

1975
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,280
It's all strutting.

1976
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:00,520
Yeah.

1977
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,720
We have to stand here and kind of keep our balance.

1978
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:06,600
And you have to jump, swaying and grab to the other side.

1979
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:11,240
Oh, that's a, I have to go off on like you drop, like you drop.

1980
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,840
Yeah, I think you have to, yeah.

1981
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,520
You have to drop and then make it so that,

1982
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,800
and we have to pull so that.

1983
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,880
Oh, well that could have gone.

1984
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,120
Okay.

1985
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:22,280
I got a bit over, over excited there at the concept of jumping off the map.

1986
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,200
Um, clearly.

1987
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:24,840
Right.

1988
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,800
Wait, so I need to.

1989
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:30,280
Somehow that's just what I'm getting.

1990
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:31,640
Yeah, no, I think you're right.

1991
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:35,080
I think you purposely have to jump off to get on again.

1992
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:37,000
Swing, swing each other.

1993
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,080
But all of us can do, yeah.

1994
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:40,040
Okay.

1995
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:46,760
If you all stand behind me and then I'm just going to purposefully swing.

1996
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,480
Oh, no, not like that.

1997
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:48,200
I didn't mean to drive.

1998
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:48,760
Wait, whoa.

1999
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,760
Wait, did I pull you guys off doing that?

2000
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,640
Oh, yeah.

2001
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:53,400
What?

2002
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,320
I thought I'm allowed to.

2003
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,760
No, I'm too.

2004
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:00,840
No, wait, no, wait.

2005
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:01,560
All right.

2006
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,200
Hold on.

2007
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:07,960
I mean, I like being a mermaid, but I'm, I'm, you're such a feather.

2008
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,360
What?

2009
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,880
It says we didn't.

2010
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,080
Surely.

2011
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2012
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,040
That's better.

2013
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:18,600
That's better.

2014
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,040
Right.

2015
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:20,840
Three, two, one.

2016
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:24,760
I knew that.

2017
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:28,760
I was like, no, that, that can't be right because we literally just got a checkpoint.

2018
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:29,880
Yeah.

2019
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:31,400
I wouldn't tolerate that game, Dave.

2020
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,040
Someone said.

2021
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,240
I know your sly games.

2022
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:35,160
I knew you're sly.

2023
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,840
Someone said one on each side.

2024
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,760
How do you get the other person to the other side?

2025
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,800
I think, I think the front and the back of the chain.

2026
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,800
So that would be already in.

2027
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,640
Oh, scrawny.

2028
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,320
Acty and scrawny.

2029
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,840
I'm so confuzzled.

2030
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,720
I wish I was in that.

2031
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:00,120
So me and scrawny, we stay on the thing.

2032
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:00,600
Is that it?

2033
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,200
Or do you think so?

2034
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,000
Okay, wait, wait.

2035
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,880
Me and Amy go and we, we stay.

2036
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,880
And then you guys on each side jump off.

2037
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,320
I think.

2038
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:14,200
I think so.

2039
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,440
So can I click on the balance?

2040
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:17,160
Oh, oh, wait.

2041
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2042
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:18,680
No, I get it.

2043
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2044
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:20,120
Wait.

2045
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,840
Oh my God.

2046
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:21,240
Wait.

2047
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:21,560
Okay.

2048
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,480
So the front of the line and the back of the line,

2049
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:26,600
they jump off on each side and then we use the chain to slide over.

2050
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:28,920
Yes.

2051
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,560
Like the chain, the chain itself.

2052
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,280
Like the chain on the log.

2053
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:34,520
Yeah.

2054
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:34,760
Yeah.

2055
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:37,720
So if scrawny and Amy are on the left.

2056
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:38,280
Yeah.

2057
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,680
Yes.

2058
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,160
Okay.

2059
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:44,760
scrawny jump one side and then acty jump the other.

2060
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,760
I'm a bit, I'm a bit the right side here.

2061
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,760
I guess you can do it like this where scrawny back up.

2062
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,120
Okay.

2063
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:50,520
Ready?

2064
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:50,840
Like this.

2065
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:52,680
Oh, wait, wait.

2066
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:53,800
I go here then.

2067
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:54,120
Yes.

2068
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,320
And then I meet your message.

2069
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:55,800
Okay.

2070
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,200
All right.

2071
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:56,360
Cool.

2072
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,000
Ready?

2073
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Three, two, one, go.

2074
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2075
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,400
No, I pulled, I pulled.

2076
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,720
No, wait.

2077
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:06,840
You are correct.

2078
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:07,640
You are correct.

2079
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,360
No way.

2080
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,640
You figured that out.

2081
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,520
Oh my God.

2082
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:10,920
Yeah.

2083
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:12,040
What?

2084
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:13,240
Hi, Sycune.

2085
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,120
That was so easy.

2086
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:16,200
We did it like fresh, I mean,

2087
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:17,800
fresh try of doing that one try.

2088
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,320
That was so easy.

2089
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,800
That was very smart.

2090
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,240
That was skill.

2091
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,440
The end.

2092
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,280
What an air thought was amazing.

2093
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,800
Right.

2094
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,160
I can't believe that.

2095
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,760
I'm like, bro, wrap up the stream.

2096
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,760
That was a 10 out of 10 moment right at the end there.

2097
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,360
Oh, yeah, no, super skill.

2098
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:36,200
Perfect to entertain them.

2099
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,880
Well, actually, how did you figure that out?

2100
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,800
I was like, because I was like, I was like, okay,

2101
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,200
because obviously someone needs to jump

2102
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,880
and then I started thinking of different ways.

2103
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,760
We could show jump, but then I realized equal weight.

2104
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,160
Literally, that was fantastic.

2105
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,040
Yeah.

2106
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,400
That was so fun to do, too.

2107
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,200
I like the slide.

2108
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,040
I'm happy to leave it there.

2109
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,560
If you guys are happy to leave it there,

2110
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,840
because that was amazing.

2111
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,440
That was a pretty move.

2112
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,200
Yeah, I don't mind.

2113
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:03,800
Yeah, I don't mind either.

2114
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,960
Yeah, that was a fun thank you so, so much,

2115
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,400
everyone for agreeing to collab.

2116
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:10,440
That was a, I hurt in a hole there.

2117
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,640
No, thank you for having us.

2118
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,520
I really enjoyed that.

2119
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,760
What I'm going to do is,

2120
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,760
I'm going to jump out of the voice call

2121
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:17,880
and wrap up my stream.

2122
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,360
But of course,

2123
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:20,760
what is that?

2124
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,680
It's like just bouncing the tree.

2125
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:23,880
Oh, you want to just bounce?

2126
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:24,520
Okay, that's fine.

2127
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,600
Oh, wait, we get more height, the more we jump.

2128
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,600
Oh, I guess.

2129
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,800
Okay, we're just going to trampoline

2130
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:30,840
to the top at this rate.

2131
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,160
But yes, what I'll do is I will leave the call

2132
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,680
and I'll wrap up my stream on my end.

2133
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,760
But thank you so, so much, Msma.

2134
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,960
Thank you so, so much, Acty.

2135
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:42,760
Thank you so, so much.

2136
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,800
I'm ever being crazy enough to collab with me.

2137
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,680
But it's been, I hurt in a hole there.

2138
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:49,880
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

2139
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:53,320
And I, hopefully, shall be talking to you guys

2140
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:54,040
at later time.

2141
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:54,760
You never know when.

2142
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,440
You never know what may be in the works.

2143
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:57,080
Yes, thank you, ma'am.

2144
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,720
Sure.

2145
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:58,600
Yes.

2146
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:01,000
But thank you for having us.

2147
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:01,480
Thank you.

2148
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:03,560
Right, I'm three weeks old.

2149
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:05,480
Yes, real three weeks old kitten.

2150
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:06,120
Real untrue.

2151
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:07,480
Okay, right.

2152
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,200
Thank you so, so much.

2153
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:09,160
I'm going to jump out of the call.

2154
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:09,800
Thank you.

2155
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:10,360
Thank you.

2156
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:11,320
I'll do the same too.

2157
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,120
Bye bye.

2158
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:12,920
Thank you, guys.

2159
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,280
It was nice meeting you.

2160
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:14,920
Thank you.

2161
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:15,720
Bye bye.

2162
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:16,440
Bye bye.

2163
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,280
We're going to see.

2164
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,280
We're going to still see all the remodels.

2165
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:24,920
Oh, it's gone.

2166
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,640
All right, there we go.

2167
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:26,520
There we go.

2168
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:27,880
Right, we're still in game hold.

2169
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:30,520
They'll be like, uh, I'm going to get this next.

2170
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,880
All right, Reblins.

2171
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:33,000
Hi.

2172
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,280
Look, I'm not, I actually really enjoy that game.

2173
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:38,840
Sorry.

2174
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,120
We might be solo in it.

2175
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:40,840
I'm not even kidding.

2176
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:41,720
We might, oh, why not?

2177
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:44,040
Why am I going to solo?

2178
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,640
We might solo that game.

2179
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,280
I actually really, really enjoyed that.

2180
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:48,760
Sorry.

2181
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:49,320
I did.

2182
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:50,680
I thought I was a good game.

2183
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:54,200
I like that the game as well actually gave you a chance.

2184
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,360
Um, hi John.

2185
01:56:58,360 --> 01:56:59,320
He has a fun collab.

2186
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:00,360
I enjoyed it.

2187
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,280
Ah, I think we might solo this game.

2188
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:08,760
Normally I get enraged by these types of games.

2189
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:11,560
Like absolutely seething red enraged.

2190
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:14,680
But because the dev team were kind enough to, you know,

2191
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:18,920
not make it impossible, um, I wouldn't mind soloing this.

2192
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,840
But the challenge is having more people.

2193
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,400
Yeah, but still a challenge for me because I'm dumb.

2194
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:29,480
You did amazing short calls through it.

2195
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:30,280
Bruh.

2196
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,480
3, 2, 1, go.

2197
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:33,720
I'm not being funny, but Misma was so on point

2198
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,480
when she was like, I'm literally going to be dreaming

2199
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:37,320
about you saying 3, 2, 1, go.

2200
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,120
3, 2, 1, go.

2201
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:38,520
Nice.

2202
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,320
3, 2, 1, go.

2203
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:42,440
It's all easy, but thanks for the stream.

2204
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,800
No, thank you for watching.

2205
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,480
Thank you, it's all easier for the Super Chat.

2206
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:47,480
Thank you the Booty Lord as well for the Super Chat.

2207
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:51,880
And Will Anderson for the membership tier.

2208
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,320
That was so fun.

2209
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:56,760
I cannot get over it.

2210
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,120
I'm going to be honest.

2211
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:01,160
I picked this game because it was easy to,

2212
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,200
I already miss you mommy.

2213
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,560
I'm not, I'm still here.

2214
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:10,280
I, so do you have 579 ping?

2215
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,680
Bruh, I thought it was ping.

2216
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,840
I thought it was ping.

2217
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:19,080
Um, I would have thought the experience

2218
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,400
streamer Ace and Maris would be so good at countdown.

2219
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,880
I made a countdown joke and I was like,

2220
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,560
oh my God, shut up strongy.

2221
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,400
Like, I was going to make a countdown like,

2222
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,320
oh wait until the teacher about real countdowns.

2223
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,000
And I was like, shut the fuck up.

2224
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,200
Don't say that.

2225
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,080
You're ruining it.

2226
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:34,920
You're ruining it.

2227
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:35,240
Okay.

2228
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:39,320
That was so fun.

2229
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:39,880
I enjoyed that.

2230
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:42,360
I actually, her actually was having

2231
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,480
troubleies through that whole thing.

2232
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:46,920
So I hope she's okay.

2233
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:48,440
You should have said it mommy.

2234
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:48,760
Please.

2235
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:51,720
There's nothing else but dust and not too many countdowns

2236
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:52,760
to stream with it.

2237
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,880
We'd have lost our shit if you said it.

2238
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,080
Well, I asked the girls.

2239
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,000
I was like, is there anything off limits?

2240
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,040
And everyone was like, nope.

2241
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:00,600
Don't be one.

2242
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,960
And I'm like, well then.

2243
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:04,680
First time I've been given permission to land a bot.

2244
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:11,080
But yes, I am

2245
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:14,440
Tee hee.

2246
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:19,160
So should we see this forbidden recipe

2247
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,600
for her noodles?

2248
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,960
I feel so bad for Ms.

2249
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:22,600
Ms. Noodles.

2250
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,400
We're so cold.

2251
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,560
This scantled me.

2252
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,600
This scantled me.

2253
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,640
But that was such a good game.

2254
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:31,160
I picked it because it's like,

2255
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:34,600
obviously the the the game or collab game at the minute.

2256
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,480
I thought it was going to be like a bit rubbishy,

2257
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,840
a bit nonsense.

2258
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,640
That was good.

2259
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:43,560
Shout out to the dev team for being wise enough

2260
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:47,320
to crack the highest unlocked point type thing.

2261
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:50,920
Cause like, oh my god, it looks so sad.

2262
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,520
I'm not chained to anyone.

2263
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,800
It looks like Play Despacito.

2264
01:59:56,600 --> 02:00:00,840
Cause like, sorry, this is such a well done game.

2265
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:02,520
I think this is a really good game.

2266
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,720
I honestly wouldn't mind soloing it.

2267
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,680
Theater, theater gone.

2268
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:11,560
Cause like, just 10 out of 10 experience.

2269
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,640
Dev team's super fair and nice about it.

2270
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:18,360
I just, I know, I know, I know.

2271
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,200
Oh, the challenge is like, you know,

2272
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:21,880
actually playing with others.

2273
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:24,840
But like as a standalone game type on its own,

2274
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,440
I would never normally play this game type.

2275
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,920
But just because of how well they've done it,

2276
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:35,640
you know, I'm, I'mma be a little, a little simp.

2277
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,440
Don't mind me.

2278
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,040
Right, I said we're just gonna solo the game right now.

2279
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,480
Should we?

2280
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,440
Wait, should we?

2281
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,840
Should I just solo the game right now?

2282
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,120
Ms. Ace and Marko have won?

2283
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,960
With Ms. Ma?

2284
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,960
Oh, careful what you wish for.

2285
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:50,760
I mean, just yeah.

2286
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:53,880
Like, sorry, but this is so fun.

2287
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,240
I recommend this game.

2288
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,240
I can't remember how much it was, but like,

2289
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,360
and yeah, it's fun until you fall.

2290
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:03,560
Well, actually, do we just, I mean,

2291
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,880
I'm supposed to be doing a member's ASMR,

2292
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:09,320
but if you guys want to, want to see me play,

2293
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,360
I don't mind playing it.

2294
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:18,360
She didn't see you, see me shamelessly.

2295
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,280
Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait, did I miss it?

2296
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,720
Oh wait, why am I going so big?

2297
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:25,320
May, may have, wait, why does it?

2298
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:28,600
May have been the brains of the operation,

2299
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,920
but I also give good brain, hit me, I'm strong.

2300
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,000
No, but I was like,

2301
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,240
when you were like, oh, we're ass to ass on the statues,

2302
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:37,960
I'm gonna draw it.

2303
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,200
I'm like, don't mind if I do.

2304
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:41,960
Don't mind if I do, because oh.

2305
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:48,440
Oh, shit, I don't know how.

2306
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:48,760
Oh!

2307
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,920
Um, illiterately.

2308
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,600
I mean, you're gonna yank through the Ace and Marko

2309
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:55,080
stream enemy.

2310
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,080
May as well just put this up on the Ace and Marko stream

2311
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:57,800
if you'll enter.

2312
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,520
Okay, I nailed that though.

2313
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:02,760
Do a pull for the stream.

2314
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:03,480
Okay, how about that?

2315
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,040
I'll do a pull.

2316
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,400
Instead of, you know, just, oh my god,

2317
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,760
I can't believe that, is it everything I said?

2318
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:15,080
Oh, I'm getting the detail.

2319
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:25,960
Oh my god, it's me!

2320
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:32,360
Wait, wait, start a pull.

2321
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,840
What should I do right now?

2322
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:37,960
Question mark.

2323
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,480
Okay, there.

2324
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,360
I started a pull.

2325
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:50,920
And while you guys vote in the pull,

2326
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:52,760
I'm gonna very quickly do the split.

2327
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:53,000
Wait.

2328
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:57,880
I cannot imagine how hard this gets once you're...

2329
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:04,120
Is that 14th Street station?

2330
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,320
Up, down.

2331
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:07,080
Let's be real soon, we need some more.

2332
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:07,640
You know what?

2333
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:08,920
How dare you insult me.

2334
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:09,960
You're surreal for that.

2335
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:11,400
What's this?

2336
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,440
Oh, I thought there was gonna be an actual train.

2337
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:16,200
Okay.

2338
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:21,240
Every time you fall, read a marshmallow.

2339
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,040
Yeah, I'm true.

2340
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:25,240
Add a third option wherever you want.

2341
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:27,000
I can already see how the pull is gonna go.

2342
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:30,280
Oh wow, it's like, you guys are actually split.

2343
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:30,840
Holy shit.

2344
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:34,600
You demand ASMR once, I'm okay.

2345
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:35,240
I can't believe it.

2346
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:38,120
I can't believe the one that does ASMR is being asked to do ASMR.

2347
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:38,920
Controversial.

2348
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,480
Absolutely controversial.

2349
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:42,200
Yeah, I'm true.

2350
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,040
In order to go up, we go down.

2351
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,120
Very clearly.

2352
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:01,160
Well.

2353
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:03,480
Well.

2354
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,880
The valley just not ASMR stream or game mapping.

2355
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,680
How dare you insult me.

2356
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:09,960
It's entirely true, literally.

2357
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:11,960
Privilege is wrong by doing a real ASMR stream then.

2358
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:15,160
Ah, but then I'm not allowed to talk.

2359
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:19,880
Not even me.

2360
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:21,320
It's gonna be members soon.

2361
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:23,240
Holy crap.

2362
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:28,040
That's actually genuinely the first time I've ever seen you guys split is when it's like this.

2363
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,120
I can't believe you want me to do ASMR.

2364
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:35,080
I just, oh, I'm heartbroken truly.

2365
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:39,080
Where the heck am I supposed to put myself in this box right now?

2366
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,600
I put myself in the box of shame.

2367
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:45,160
And yapping is what the education stream is.

2368
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,000
Just another member's yap afterwards.

2369
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:00,280
Wait, I'm supposed to secretly go this way?

2370
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:01,240
Oh, sorry.

2371
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:02,440
Oh, I'm so excited there.

2372
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:04,600
Okay, right.

2373
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,320
I'll wrap it up.

2374
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,280
Wrap it up.

2375
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:07,000
Wrap it up.

2376
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,120
Re-saving quit.

2377
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,800
Are you sure you want to quit?

2378
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,800
Yeah.

2379
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:12,760
Right.

2380
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,040
I am going to prepare for a member's ASMR.

2381
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:17,080
That was such a good game.

2382
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:21,480
Please do give me five minutes because I'm going to go for a tinkle and make a cookie scene.

2383
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,680
Are you squirming me right now?

2384
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:32,280
Thank you for the super chat, T.I. Crutonson.

2385
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,440
ASMR is losing mumma.

2386
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,800
There may be angel wings at the bottom.

2387
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:42,520
ASMR for a bit.

2388
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,040
Yeah, watch this bit of the game again.

2389
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:48,200
Secretly have the game running in the background.

2390
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:53,960
Right.

2391
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:56,200
If you give me five minutes, I'm going to make a cup of tea.

2392
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:59,880
I'm going to go for a tinkle and then I will set up the member's ASMR.

2393
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:10,040
And then I will do ASMR for a whole five seconds.

2394
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,560
I'm so sorry.

2395
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:17,080
I'm so sorry.

2396
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:19,720
That's a little bit too real.

2397
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:20,520
Okay.

2398
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,760
Keyboard ASMR and play the game during the ASMR.

2399
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:23,640
My keys are red.

2400
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:25,000
You haven't felt the best part though.

2401
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:32,920
I should, honestly, I should be like, oh, the ASMR member is so exclusive, so good.

2402
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:39,400
For those of you who aren't a member, please don't actually worry about the member's content.

2403
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:42,920
The reason I say that is because there's a running gag.

2404
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:48,840
I always plan, I have members ASMR and within maybe 10 minutes,

2405
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:52,680
I give up on actually doing the ASMR because I'm just so excited to talk.

2406
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,880
Um, which is why we yap.

2407
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
That's why the ASMR gets me done because I always don't.

2408
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:08,360
The, the public ASMR streams are about 10 times more professional than any membership stream

2409
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:09,240
I've ever done.

2410
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:09,560
Okay.

2411
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:14,840
So don't, if you're like, oh, I feel, I feel, I suck that I'm missing out.

2412
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:15,800
You're not missing out.

2413
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:17,720
I am being outrageous.

2414
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:18,840
Outrageous stuff.

2415
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,840
10 minutes mean generous.

2416
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:22,280
It's more like a minute, real and true.

2417
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:27,160
Um, yes, you're doing a good job with the kiss and ASMR.

2418
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:30,840
Yes, I, it's, we all mean it on it.

2419
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:31,400
Right.

2420
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:39,560
Give me the ability to redirect into Shibi if she's streaming, but I don't know if she's

2421
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:48,840
streaming, but I hope that she is streaming so I can redirect and give me one more chance.

2422
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:57,160
Doesn't look like she's streaming.

2423
02:07:58,920 --> 02:07:59,720
I enjoy your voice.

2424
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:01,080
I can listen to it for days.

2425
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,680
Wait, why is the thumbnail vermin tamed?

2426
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,000
What?

2427
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:15,560
The thumbnail says vermin tamed too for me.

2428
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:18,360
YouTube, please wake up and spell the daisies.

2429
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:19,880
What's going on with these thumbnails?

2430
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:22,520
I don't know why it's like having such a meep.

2431
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:29,880
An absolute mental, mental, ex-oriental like thing going on because it's not vermin tamed.

2432
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:33,320
So who is next?

2433
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:36,680
It would be Azura is online at 11.

2434
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:40,280
What? You're going to redirect into a stream that's five hours away?

2435
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:41,080
Yes.

2436
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:42,760
What are you going to do about it?

2437
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:43,080
Far?

2438
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:48,200
Are you scared that you might enjoy the stream in five hours time?

2439
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:49,800
Exactly.

2440
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:51,560
Yeah, that's right.

2441
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:52,040
Don't be s-

2442
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,040
That's right.

2443
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:55,400
Yeah.

2444
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:58,200
You haven't had the thumbnail change for the last two streams?

2445
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:04,760
A thumbnail show with the trutist tumor truly once.

2446
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,920
Well, we're doing vermin tamed stream snipe.

2447
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:08,440
Oh wait, I can show you my schedule.

2448
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:10,440
Wait, did I even show you my schedule?

2449
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,040
Now, hold on a minute.

2450
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:13,640
Let me show you my schedule.

2451
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:15,320
Don't you go anywhere just yet.

2452
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,360
I'm not done with you.

2453
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,600
This is my-

2454
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:19,960
Nope, it's not my schedule.

2455
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:20,600
Scheisse.

2456
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,400
It's not made.

2457
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,800
Okay, well, right.

2458
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:26,520
Here's verbally what my schedule is.

2459
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:27,960
Not on the correct day.

2460
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:28,280
Okay.

2461
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,720
College of Black Ops one campaign.

2462
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:37,320
Vermintide two with you, not on a weekend for the stream snipe.

2463
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:39,160
This is for people who work on the weekends.

2464
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:42,520
Doodling my gen mates is coming up.

2465
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,800
Golfic collab with my gen mates is coming up.

2466
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:49,240
Hypnosis ASMR to forget your name.

2467
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:52,120
A member's valetral stream.

2468
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:55,240
A member's script writing stream.

2469
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:59,480
We're watching the Kingsman, the Secret Service.

2470
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:04,360
We are playing and finishing Peggle.

2471
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,600
And we are also 100% Sonic Heroes.

2472
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:13,640
And we are also playing Tavern Master, a game about owning a tavern.

2473
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:14,360
I thought it was cute.

2474
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:16,040
Reminded me of kind of the Hobbit vibe.

2475
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,120
So we're playing that, get right.

2476
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:20,680
A W week.

2477
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:26,360
But yes, I'm writing the Hypnosis to forget your name script.

2478
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,400
I'll be very interested.

2479
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:28,520
It's going to be a live stream.

2480
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:33,000
My only note about next week's schedule is the ASMR stream.

2481
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,440
Is that Icey's time slot?

2482
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:35,960
Because I'm going to redirect into Icey.

2483
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:37,000
That was my PC.

2484
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:37,800
That was my PC.

2485
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:38,600
It wasn't your PC.

2486
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:39,080
That was mine.

2487
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:41,000
Virus and threat protection.

2488
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,920
Windows didn't detect anything.

2489
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:45,800
We're getting Peggle this week.

2490
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:49,880
Oh, you're getting Peggle so hard in all of that.

2491
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:50,920
Windows said it was me.

2492
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:51,480
It was me.

2493
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:52,600
Okay, don't panic.

2494
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:55,000
College of Black Ops one, Vermintide two, Doodling gen mates.

2495
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:56,840
Hypnosis ASMR.

2496
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,520
Look at you.

2497
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,960
You take that fast as anything.

2498
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,600
Yes, we're going to finish Peggle campaign mode.

2499
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,280
We're going to finish Sonic Heroes.

2500
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:08,440
We're kind of finishing up streams that we started.

2501
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:13,240
College of Black Ops campaign, I think is six hours together.

2502
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:19,160
Golfic collab with my gen mates is two hours or less.

2503
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:20,360
Maybe an hour and a half.

2504
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,720
It may be a bit shorter.

2505
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:25,720
Just because it's on Azure's doughnathon.

2506
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:28,760
Obviously, the focus is on Azure, not us.

2507
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:32,280
We will be redirecting into Azure, all that jazz on her doughnathon.

2508
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:38,200
The Black Ops are going to bring back lobby flashbacks and all of us.

2509
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:39,800
At some point, I can see you're doing Cod Zombies.

2510
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,240
Oh no, I'm terrified of Cod Zombies.

2511
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,520
I can't do it on my own.

2512
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:43,320
I'm too scared.

2513
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:46,520
Are you going to play Super Hard mode in Sonic Heroes?

2514
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:47,000
Wait, what?

2515
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:54,200
I thought 100% was finishing Team Chaos, Team Rose.

2516
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,040
I don't know that.

2517
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:58,680
Have you decided the enemy?

2518
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:00,840
It's Vivi Eyeball, something.

2519
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:02,920
Good luck.

2520
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:04,360
I don't know the name of it.

2521
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:13,800
Remember that time I had a laugh and fit over a freaking happy sugar life?

2522
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,200
Hold on.

2523
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:15,400
Let me link that.

2524
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:16,360
You'll hear me twice.

2525
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,680
Remember that time I had a laugh and fit?

2526
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,160
Are you ready?

2527
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,720
Oh, another score.

2528
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:26,200
The fucking tear drop.

2529
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,160
I didn't expect the physics.

2530
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:46,120
So yeah, if you didn't watch the happy sugar life, watch along.

2531
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:51,880
I have time stamped if you want to watch it along with me and be shocked at the anime series.

2532
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:59,960
I time stamped the laugh and then I ended up having a laughing fit because I didn't expect.

2533
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:03,480
So a tear randomly drops on her face.

2534
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,800
And you know, maybe in me.

2535
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:10,440
Oh, Azura is cancelling today's stream.

2536
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:13,160
So we're going to redirect him to Mercy instead.

2537
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:17,480
Hold on.

2538
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:19,720
Let me type in Chiki Mercy Modist.

2539
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:23,880
Um...

2540
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:29,880
Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.

2541
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:31,720
Mercy, Mercy.

2542
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,880
Today she's streaming.

2543
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:39,080
Well, I'm going to redirect you into stream that seven hours away.

2544
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:40,200
Yes, I am.

2545
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:41,160
What are you going to do?

2546
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:42,040
Start?

2547
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:42,360
Nothing.

2548
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:43,480
You're not going to do a thing.

2549
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:45,080
I'm sure you've been forced to enjoy it.

2550
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:45,320
Okay.

2551
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,160
I don't care what you say.

2552
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:49,240
Should it?

2553
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:49,880
Should it be?

2554
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:53,720
Strony started to wind down and I said something and I started off again.

2555
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:55,960
Oh, it was that Harry Potter receipt one.

2556
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,080
Man, I was pottering my puppy.

2557
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:06,040
I couldn't catch the HSL VOD this morning like I wanted.

2558
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:09,080
When you watch it, just be warned.

2559
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:11,080
Episode five, I have a laughing fit.

2560
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:13,720
So if you want to watch it with me, I have time stamped it.

2561
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:15,640
If you go into the VOD, it's all time stamped.

2562
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,440
So if you're wanting to put something on in the background

2563
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:21,640
and watch an Annie Moose with me, you're more than welcome to.

2564
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:24,040
Obviously, I yapped for like 20 minutes as always.

2565
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:28,280
You're sensei humorous, Kate.

2566
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:28,920
Bruh.

2567
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:29,720
Ray Jimmy.

2568
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:32,360
I don't think Emmy is up today.

2569
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:38,600
I know there most likely is a stream displayed on Emmys,

2570
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,480
but I don't think it's happening.

2571
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:43,640
If it is, I apologize.

2572
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:47,960
But I am under the impression that our beloved little sister

2573
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:48,760
needs some time.

2574
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:56,920
So please do not be upset if she does not stream

2575
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:59,800
and delete it for a later date.

2576
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:00,840
Yes.

2577
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:08,760
Unless she has given an indication on Twitter that she's doing something.

2578
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:11,800
Ah, did she say?

2579
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:15,720
I didn't realize she said.

2580
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:19,960
Did she say on her alternative Twitter?

2581
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,520
Ah, she did.

2582
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:26,600
Fuck, yeah.

2583
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:28,040
She said it 30 minutes ago.

2584
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:35,640
Emmy's pet passed away and she doesn't feel very good.

2585
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:39,480
She has been given full permission to not, you know,

2586
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:43,000
you don't need fucking permission from us to not stream or anything like that.

2587
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,560
That's absolutely fuck all to do with us.

2588
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:49,720
Yes.

2589
02:15:55,240 --> 02:16:00,440
So we will redirect into Mercy.

2590
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:01,400
It's seven hours away.

2591
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,800
I know it's quite the time away, but it is what it is.

2592
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:10,520
But yes, Emmy has absolutely no, as with anyone, a veiler.

2593
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:15,640
And she has no obligation to stream.

2594
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,640
None of that fucking.

2595
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,600
No one gives a shit.

2596
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:21,800
No one gives a shit about what a little piece of paper contracts is.

2597
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:23,240
She can take all the time she needs.

2598
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:25,880
And that is that.

2599
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:32,520
If you want to leave some nice messages,

2600
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:34,600
why the fuck is my VTuber model so cool?

2601
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:38,760
If you want to leave some nice messages in her marshmallow,

2602
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:43,560
you can grab the link via her descriptions on any video or anything like that.

2603
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,480
Even if it's just a love heart, something nice.

2604
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,280
You most certainly can.

2605
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:53,400
But yes, one of her pets passed away.

2606
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:56,760
So she is not going to stream for a little while.

2607
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:57,640
I don't think.

2608
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:01,640
We're just about, obviously, we're fucking fine.

2609
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:02,600
I haven't seen anything.

2610
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:05,640
Right, I'm going to redirect into Mercy.

2611
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:06,600
Give me five minutes.

2612
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:11,880
I will make a cup of honey tea and then swap around my microphones.

2613
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:13,880
So, yes.

2614
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:20,040
Sorry to end that on such a sad note.

2615
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:29,000
But yeah, I just, I don't want anyone thinking, you know, oh my god.

2616
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,400
I mean, it feels forced to stream.

2617
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:33,640
Nope, no, that shit is all the time she needs.

2618
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:34,440
We ain't like that.

2619
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:35,560
We don't do that shit here.

2620
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:39,880
We do not give two fucking shits about fucking the week like that.

2621
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:40,440
I assure you.

2622
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:44,600
Right, I do apologize for ending on such a sad note.

2623
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:47,640
I did find out yesterday and yes.

2624
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:48,200
Okay.

2625
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,600
Thank you for the good stream.

2626
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,720
Appreciate it.

2627
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:54,200
As always, I'm very thankful towards Misma,

2628
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:55,640
very thankful towards Aimee,

2629
02:17:55,640 --> 02:18:00,360
and very thankful towards Acty for collabing and playing with me.

2630
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:03,960
I was very nice to them because I set that collab up.

2631
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:10,600
And we had funsies because I'm always like, oh no, what happened?

2632
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:15,080
But yes, it was very nice.

2633
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:23,800
Right, I am going to go and get ready and make a cup of tea.

2634
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,040
Okay.

2635
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:27,240
Thank you so, so much.

2636
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,480
I will see you shortly in the member stream.

2637
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:36,040
If not, I will see you tomorrow for Handcam Popping Cooking.

2638
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:39,960
Yes, I'm putting my fake nails on.

2639
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:41,480
You want to know why?

2640
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:44,360
Because the glue is still stuck on top of my nails.

2641
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,320
I can't get it off.

2642
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:45,640
Okay.

2643
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:50,040
Tomorrow is Handcam Popping Cooking

2644
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:55,880
and also Member Stream Discussion Donut on the wards.

2645
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:00,200
But if there's any leaks, I will never ever talk about that shit again.

2646
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,120
Because that's not the deal.

2647
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:05,000
Cooking was trying to be eating goods.

2648
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,120
Ask the tone, Momay.

2649
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:06,760
I'm no.

2650
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:09,720
Ask the tones the reason why I had like nae freaking nails.

2651
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:12,120
The stride, my nails.

2652
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:15,720
Mummy forever sticky, if you'll enter.

2653
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:19,160
The opera singer got it for a sec.

2654
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:22,040
We can keep it a secret, Momay.

2655
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:22,840
Ah, you better.

2656
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:24,440
Or else you're all getting a spanking.

2657
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,200
You're all getting lined up and spanked.

2658
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,680
Right.

2659
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:31,640
I am going to go make a honey tea.

2660
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:32,760
I'll be back in five minutes.

2661
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:33,000
Okay.

2662
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:36,360
I will swap around to the 3DO.

2663
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,200
This cheeky microphone.

2664
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:39,320
I give you kisses.

2665
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:42,360
I give you four kisses because there was four of us in this collab.

2666
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:51,640
One, two, three, four.

2667
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:57,800
Oh, I recorded the kiss and collab we wrote together, by the way.

2668
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:59,000
Oh no, it's not collab.

2669
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,160
Well, it was a collab between us coming up with it.

2670
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,680
So, you know what?

2671
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:05,800
Okay.

2672
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:09,240
I'll see you tomorrow, or I'll see you in five minutes, by the way.

2673
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:10,040
Thank you so so much.

2674
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:13,240
Please enjoy being redirected into a stream that's seven hours away.

2675
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:17,240
Bye.
