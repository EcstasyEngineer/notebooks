2677440	2680800	do an original song yeah they're like why did veeler not do an original song oh i brought
2680800	2684720	it stressful and i was trying to debut last thing i want to do is give them a custom song that
2684720	2689040	like to try and do but if you guys want to like we should all have an original we should have an
2689040	2693520	a group song that's an original okay i'll do the male part of the song because my voice can have
2693520	2703760	that i'll do the rap part of the song i'll do the backup vocals that leaves azura and mercy
2703760	2709440	and icy perfect we're good yeah they can carry us through the through the actual vocals exactly

2834080	2843280	yeah what song is this i'm wondering it makes sense that they picked like a k-pop group
2843280	2847440	because they all have like girl singers of different parts it's a twice song it is a twice song
2847600	2851600	i feel like i would recognize it if it was a
2851600	2859760	twice song but i guess i'm a fake twice fan name this particular members grandmother's

2873200	2873600	oh my god
