23:45.820 --> 23:47.820
we don't want a heart attack on stream

35:10.460 --> 35:16.260
that's where I lose my soul. I'm gonna need refling, I'm gonna need something

35:16.260 --> 35:21.500
that helps me replenish my salt levels. Huh huh huh come on it's too easy to make these

35:21.500 --> 35:26.700

35:38.340 --> 35:48.020

35:48.020 --> 35:56.460
Okay this hurts. Well pressing in your stomach lean. Okay.

35:57.660 --> 36:06.740

36:06.780 --> 36:12.500
sick. Hold on I need a burp. Oh that wasn't a good one. That wasn't a good burp

36:12.500 --> 36:20.260
refling. It has been a worse result. And he walked up to the hill and he

36:20.260 --> 36:31.100
marched him down again. What? I don't think I get it. Actually. Ready? Not really.

36:31.100 --> 36:41.060
Go! Oh the grand old jerk of york. He had ten thousand men. He marched them up to the

36:41.060 --> 36:46.300
top of the hill and he marched them down again. Oh when they were up they were up.

36:46.300 --> 36:53.620
And when they were down they were down. And when they were only half way around they were either up or down.

36:53.620 --> 36:58.620
That is a British chant for you. There you go.

36:59.620 --> 37:07.220
Okay I got the 300. This is the worst one ever. Oh no. Can we go a bit more to the right?

37:07.220 --> 37:14.100
Hey hey hey. Hit him with a hey hey. Okay hold on. I'm on a tamer. Why did I hear

37:14.140 --> 37:20.300
tamer noises? I'm getting nervous. I'm sweating. Why did I hear tamer noises? I don't see a tamer.

37:20.300 --> 37:27.260
So I'm actually jogging on the spot right now. I am not losing to tame. I'm not

37:27.260 --> 37:35.460

37:35.460 --> 37:41.300
Shawnee didn't you get the lyrics right? Like how dare you? How much does everyone

37:41.300 --> 37:47.780
reveal their way? We used to be the biggest. Emmie, Tiny, Aisy, Tiny, Mercy, Nex,

37:47.780 --> 37:53.060
Shawnee, Nex. She beat Nex. Azura can be as big as a skyscraper because she's a

37:53.060 --> 37:57.740
goddess. So good luck measuring her. Oh my god. I had to do that off the top of my

37:57.740 --> 38:06.460
head. No. Oh I didn't. Why would you not let me. Oh whatever finish. Whatever. If you

38:06.460 --> 38:12.020
screw up the coins to spawn. I didn't even grab them. The tamer is just for our coin

38:12.020 --> 38:25.900
points. Oh well. You know what we should play Wii Fit. That Wii Fit game. Like on that

38:25.900 --> 38:31.620
board. And you stand on the board and the things that you fat bastard. And you guys can

38:31.620 --> 38:38.260
know my real weight. Like whenever someone's like oh how much do you weigh? Whenever I tell

38:38.260 --> 38:41.540
them they're like I don't believe it. You don't look as heavy as that. And I'm like yeah

38:41.540 --> 38:47.060
it's all in the dumpy. Thank you. I'll be here all week. You have your strength at high

38:47.060 --> 38:54.500
by the way. I do? The best way I can describe your body would be when Shawnee and Ruben

38:54.500 --> 39:00.740
Esk curvy all over. I don't even know what that means. What does Ruben Esk mean? You're

39:00.740 --> 39:06.140
using English and I don't know. Right core crusher. Right we'll play all the minigames

39:06.140 --> 39:10.780
and then I think we'll do a running one. Wait why did that not work? Oh the things sideways.

39:10.780 --> 39:14.980
That's why it didn't work. The things sideways after that game. I don't know why they did

39:14.980 --> 39:20.620
it that way but sure sure. Right we'll do all the minigames. And then we'll let's get

39:20.860 --> 39:25.580
to it. It's in the dump truck. I'm gonna need proof of that. You'll get proof in October

39:25.580 --> 39:31.860
all you need. Everything you need baby. Wait what? Rotate it to the left again. No I hate

39:31.860 --> 39:37.340
these ones. I'm gonna squeeze out a fart at this rate. I'm just pushing against my stomach

39:37.340 --> 39:43.260
and my stomach goes at any fart. While pressing into your stomach twist to the right. Oh my

39:43.340 --> 39:53.340
headset's getting away. Now release the tension while pressing in on your stomach. What is

39:53.340 --> 40:03.020
this? What is this? Smash all the robots. Be careful of the robots with your shield. With

40:03.100 --> 40:17.260
your shield. What? What is this? Go. Relax and then press and hit. And relax, press, hit,

40:17.260 --> 40:29.900

40:29.980 --> 40:34.620
to say it. I'm having to say it. I'm just saying it out loud. I'm just fucking aware.

40:36.460 --> 40:46.780
Oh I'm relaxed, relaxed. It's like Kegel exercises but worse. Relax, relax. I'm like freaking

40:46.860 --> 40:47.580
Breville in.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.580
Your shield is rubbish.

41:01.580 --> 41:11.180
Relax, relax. Reflex, relax. Just let it happen, relax. Oh my god.

41:11.420 --> 41:20.940
Oh that was a hard one. Quit feying me, reflet. My god. Oh I need to sit down after that one.

41:26.940 --> 41:28.460
Oh I'm sitting there on my chair.

41:29.420 --> 41:43.500
Oh my god that was so hard. I had to like freaking remember. Are you squiddin' me right now?

41:43.500 --> 41:44.220
Thank you.

41:44.940 --> 42:00.140
Why? Anon would like to ask. Wait what was my heart rate? 186? Okay. Heart rate record.

42:01.500 --> 42:04.140
186. Let's go.

42:07.260 --> 42:12.300
Okay. Anon would like to ask. Hi Stroni. I was wondering when it comes to running.

42:12.300 --> 42:17.580
Are you a sprinter or do you run for endurance? And I don't either. Like do you care about how

42:17.580 --> 42:23.980
fast you are or how far you're going? I'd like to compare workers. You know you see I am a dwarf

42:23.980 --> 42:29.740
from Lord of the Rings. I'm great short distances and by short distances I mean less than 100 meters.

42:29.740 --> 42:35.820
I am a cyclist and I am a walker. I am not a sprinter. So when we get to the sprinting stage

42:35.820 --> 42:40.380
we're gonna do a level that requires sprinting. You are going to hear how much I do not sprint.

42:40.380 --> 42:44.140
Okay.

42:48.140 --> 42:51.660
Okay. Our heart rate record is 186. So we think we can beat it. I don't know.

42:54.300 --> 42:59.980
Need to go cycle. Like I can cycle fine. Cycle and I have no issues with. Right. Uh sure record it.

42:59.980 --> 43:07.980
Why not? To Stroni. Not to be confused with uh I don't know something else that you could confuse

43:08.860 --> 43:17.500
with. Um right gulting wait get lit-utting gallery. Lean left and right to avoid the

43:17.500 --> 43:22.300
bomba. So we've got three more minigames and then we're going to do jogging. Are you ready for the

43:22.300 --> 43:33.660
jogging? Ha ha ha. Gonna do jogging there. Right get lit-utting gallery. Wait as in gluttonous as

43:33.660 --> 43:40.620
in you fat bastard. Did the game just call me obese? What the fuck? 186 feet per minute. That's

43:40.620 --> 43:45.180
right you can see it live here folks. You know what you've never seen a hyperactive heart before?

43:45.180 --> 43:49.340
Well now you have. Now you have. That was me slapping my thighs by the way.

43:52.620 --> 43:59.420
I'm not uh I'm not doing Mario Kart tomorrow. We're playing Suica or Suqya. What do we do?

43:59.500 --> 44:04.460
What have you stumbled into? Just the most suspicious noises a woman can make that isn't

44:04.460 --> 44:13.420
suspicious at all. You've got quick circulation. What can I say these? Oh no it's an arm one. Oh no.

44:16.380 --> 44:22.860
Okay that's fine I can do that. Oh I'm gonna burp again but not the good kind.

44:23.740 --> 44:31.100
Oh that's a vomit kind of burp. Would you still love me if I vomited up all my water from this morning?

44:33.580 --> 44:37.980
No you're glutes meaning your ass. Collect all the tokens. I'll try my best. Ready?

44:41.260 --> 44:50.460
You pronounce it gluting as in your glutes. Oh glutes! Glutes maximum. Oh I get it now. Okay that

44:50.460 --> 44:55.820
makes sense. I thought I was calling me gluttonous and I was like excuse you. Why do you think I'm on

44:55.820 --> 45:01.660
the video game in the first place? Gluttonous based on... Clean to the side as you breathe out.

45:01.660 --> 45:09.420
Clean to the side as you breathe out. I'm leaning, I'm leaning, I'm leaning, I'm leaning, I'm leaning.

45:09.980 --> 45:18.060
I like this one. This is so easy. I'm just standing on the spot.

45:20.780 --> 45:23.980
I said it too quick. I shouldn't have said anything. The bombs were too much.

45:27.260 --> 45:31.980
Thank you time to say me for telling me the right title. You didn't have to pay me to do that though.

45:31.980 --> 45:37.500
You could have just typed it in chat. You guys when you're flipping to put on a bug my hips are

45:37.580 --> 45:43.340
like cross the bullet for it in real life as well. Like I don't need to lean with my hips but I'm just

45:44.140 --> 45:53.180
just to prove how curvy I am. Oh look at the week 2 E birds as well. Oh they're so beautiful.

45:54.380 --> 46:02.380
Can I get so big? Oh my first perfect. Let's go. Leave it to me. Record. Yeah I'm going to rub it in

46:02.380 --> 46:08.060
the girl's face as I got perfect. Me telling them hey when you guys play this game you need to do

46:08.060 --> 46:15.500
the minigames for no particular reason just so I can like rank them all. Do you use bike for

46:15.500 --> 46:25.340
exercise or leisure for transport? So I get healthy from it. Anon. Anon in this says,

46:25.340 --> 46:30.300
Strony. Paint you an audio idea. Strony pulls the thigh muscle after pushing herself too hard from

46:30.300 --> 46:34.940
her workout and asks for response to help stretch out her muscles to relieve the pain with the

46:34.940 --> 46:41.100
massage. I think you can see where the rest of it's going. Hey hey hey. Hey hey hey. That's

46:41.100 --> 46:46.700
literally a Zura's most recent audio thing. We think of like Anon because I literally wrote that

46:46.700 --> 46:57.340
for a Zura. Roughly. And I say has one coming out as well actually. It's my brat's irresistible thighs.

46:57.900 --> 47:03.660
You're welcome OGsans. I know exactly what you all want to hear for the most part. Yes my

47:03.660 --> 47:08.620
scripts are shit but in general I know what you want to hear. Right what's my heart rate? Okay I'll

47:08.620 --> 47:15.820
wait until it goes down to 140. Okay let's sit down for a moment. Why did it go up? Why is it whenever

47:15.820 --> 47:22.220
I say what's my heart rate? My heart gets nervous and like jumps up. I'm sitting down to give myself

47:22.220 --> 47:29.820
a second. I saw the stream get some sleep and well. Res well thanks for hanging. At least you

47:29.820 --> 47:36.780
aren't taping glorp your giggle stick bro. Hey y'all. Has mummy pushed herself hard? She's been behaving.

47:36.780 --> 47:47.420
186 beats per minute. So for every second my heart beated twice and then some. Roughly. Then some.

47:48.300 --> 47:52.220
We are reaching 175. Break core. That's so good.

47:53.180 --> 47:58.700
Strony sweat rack. Thank you for the tip. Hi Strony make sure to work up a good sweat and then you

47:58.700 --> 48:03.100
can use me. Clean it up once you're done. Well I was gonna see if I can give myself a round of

48:03.100 --> 48:09.980
applause at the end of stream. Uh if you know you know. You know I just thought we could. Your

48:09.980 --> 48:18.220
scripts are now. Your scripts are now giggle sticks by like them. I mean AC was like AC got

48:18.220 --> 48:22.620
back to me and she was like I really liked how simplistic the way your scripts were written

48:22.620 --> 48:27.980
in comparison to the script master and I was like right I'll send them a message. I'll tell them

48:27.980 --> 48:35.740
you know to copy the way I do it. Um for the most part. Uh mummy ain't gonna have the energy to jump.

48:36.620 --> 48:44.460
Okay we're 130. Okay I went up because I noticed it but it's just because my heart rate is so shy

48:44.460 --> 48:51.420
okay. She doesn't deserve such things. Right whoever said exercise doesn't take up time.

48:52.300 --> 48:56.860
I'm already exhausted and we're not even hit the 50 minute mark. I said what I said I'm exhausted.

48:57.420 --> 49:03.980
I we're gonna get any more armpit audios. Um from Emmy in the video game maybe.

49:05.820 --> 49:13.500
What was that? That was just a silly. With your elbows swing too slow. Okay hold on hold on let me

49:13.500 --> 49:20.300
take my headset off. The body headsets wires in the way. I'm getting obliterated right too slow.

49:21.100 --> 49:25.980
What? With your elbows at the side swing it.

49:29.420 --> 49:35.900
What is going on? Bro give us a. The guy is stalling out. Is that all in? All right I'm just

49:35.900 --> 49:43.420
gonna do that thing. I'm actually looking for. With your elbows at your side swing. I can't swing

49:43.420 --> 49:48.060
that fast. I'm not even. Who played this game more? This is shit.

49:51.100 --> 49:55.980
I'm getting absolutely rolled in a freaking exercise video game.

49:59.980 --> 50:03.260
That was awful. Go do that again. Smack all the discs.

50:04.780 --> 50:09.580
That was awful. I'm thinking I'm gonna get sunwalked in a freaking exercise video game.

50:10.540 --> 50:15.020
I'm just fucking doing this. I'm fucking swinging.

50:16.300 --> 50:19.900
I'm swinging. With your elbows at your side twist your upper body.

50:19.900 --> 50:25.660
Oh yeah you like that. Okay I'll fuck it. Wait they take points for me missing even though

50:25.660 --> 50:34.060
the game makes sense. I'm freaking swinging yeah. You can literally see by my model I am swinging

50:34.060 --> 50:38.700
on the spot right. My ass meat is jiggling.

50:42.140 --> 50:47.180
Oh forgiveness sake. Bro I'm actually getting sunwalked.

50:50.300 --> 50:57.180
I'm getting sunwalked in a freaking exercise video game. Oh come on me. Come on give me a shot.

51:04.860 --> 51:11.900
Oh come on. Fuck off that was the worst game we have played by far.

51:12.620 --> 51:19.260
And I got a bravo for that. I'm right. That was awful. My ass meat is what jiggling.

51:19.820 --> 51:24.140
I was going left and right and I could feel it. I'm moving and I was like excuse me.

51:25.020 --> 51:29.340
Strongly barefoot. I wouldn't game with freaking shoes on. Are you serious?

51:29.900 --> 51:35.020
I had a game with shoes on. We should not get in the spring a lot. Right last mini game.

51:39.660 --> 51:42.860
And then we're going to do running and I will show you how pathetic my running is.

51:47.260 --> 51:53.180
The treadmill. Oh this is the running game mode. Control your running speed to move

51:53.180 --> 51:57.420
left or right on the treadmill and gather tokens. What?

52:00.540 --> 52:09.580
Oh it's good though. It's good. Next time jiggle him up.

52:12.060 --> 52:15.740
Yeah I ain't killed down before this next runner one because if it's about like

52:16.540 --> 52:18.700
but running my heart rate is going to

52:19.820 --> 52:29.180
explode. At over 180 my heart was beaten three times per second. Oh yeah you're right 180 divided

52:29.180 --> 52:38.220
by three is 60. Yeah. Yeah. Oh that's so cool. My heart was beaten three times per second.

52:38.380 --> 52:43.980
Boom boom boom. So literally boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. That's what my heart

52:43.980 --> 52:47.580
was doing. Are you squiddin me right now? I'm so smart.

52:51.660 --> 52:56.220
I don't know. I don't say it's so strong. He likes guys with a little bit of chop in their stomach.

52:56.220 --> 53:04.460
I like fat boys. Give me fat men. Hey Tony. I want to feed you. I want to rub your belly

53:04.460 --> 53:12.380
after a hand feed you. Get like sit on your lap. Spoon feed you. Maybe like take away or something.

53:13.980 --> 53:17.740
Then I rub your belly afterwards. And then I R word you.

53:25.260 --> 53:33.420
Architect oh she. And don't worry if you're a beanpole apparently that's the terminology

53:33.420 --> 53:39.180
which I found absolutely hilarious when you guys taught me. If you're a beanpole don't worry I'll

53:39.180 --> 53:45.900
fatten you up. We'll hold you to that promise.

53:49.500 --> 53:54.220
Actually apparently skinny guys are called beanpoles. I'm gonna find out the funniest thing I've ever

53:54.220 --> 54:03.020
read in my life. Wait does Stroney live in a gingerbread home? No I'm not a witch. Are you

54:03.020 --> 54:09.260
serious? The witch that makes those wainzy candy sweets and that? No I'm not a witch.

54:11.820 --> 54:16.460
Stroney's laughing at me. I'm not laughing at you. Are you a beanpole? If you're a beanpole don't

54:16.460 --> 54:22.700
worry. Just order take away. It's fine. I'll make you some of my treats.

54:25.180 --> 54:30.860
What if you're kind of average? Then it's easy to put weight on you. Smile. Do you not know how

54:30.860 --> 54:38.540
architecture works? I'm Hansel Maxing. Oh that's so good.

54:39.420 --> 54:45.900
Okay right enough stalling. Do the next exercise. You lazy lazy switch.

54:47.020 --> 54:51.500
Or say full of poet. I'm not a squid. I'm a skunkish. You're facts right.

54:51.500 --> 54:55.100
Right I'm standing up again. Let's see how much my heart rate goes up because I stood up.

54:57.180 --> 54:58.300
Oh we're in the 30s.

55:02.700 --> 55:07.580
I know it's my time and I'll be. It's so far over for me. I need at least 10 years in film

55:07.580 --> 55:13.500
dad bod ready. I can make it happen. I don't know. Give me like eight months. I think I'll get what I want.

55:22.860 --> 55:28.540
Okay are you squidding me right now? Just slow point the ring there. If we run ahead and

55:28.540 --> 55:36.220
lead you with a leash would you run faster mama? Would you run faster? Wait what if we run it?

55:36.220 --> 55:39.980
Sorry my headset is currently hitting the microphone. You stop that young man.

55:41.260 --> 55:45.340
What do you say Kaidon? If we run ahead and lead you with a leash would you run

55:45.340 --> 55:50.140
faster? If you run ahead. No I don't like running. I don't enjoy running. Don't make me run.

55:50.140 --> 55:57.420
Walkies fine. Absolutely fine on walkies. Running? No. I won't burp again. The water's coming back.

55:58.540 --> 56:02.220
But not the good kid. I think I actually am going to be sick if I'm not careful.

56:03.100 --> 56:05.820
Oh I just threw up in my throat.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.460
Oh dear. What did I do?

56:14.620 --> 56:17.100
And that was pure stomach acid in my throat.

56:22.860 --> 56:27.260
All right I'll tell, I'll make you a deal. We'll finish this one and then we'll have a bit of a

56:27.580 --> 56:35.420
break. Oh I just threw up. What did I do? My whole point is a true mistake exercise and I can't.

56:38.860 --> 56:44.540
All right give me one more, give me one more chance okay? Clean it out. Ready? What am I going to do?

56:46.700 --> 56:49.260
Okay I can do this. I can do this. Just one more, one more.

56:50.220 --> 56:55.100
Wait how did I go backwards? I just stopped running.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.220
Oh my gosh. Are you squidding me right now?

57:01.820 --> 57:07.420
No she's just going to be like an English bulldog. Lying down and not moving.

57:09.100 --> 57:13.740
Wait I'll check it out. That's a return assist. Wait how did I make it so I'm only in one leg?

57:14.700 --> 57:25.180
Oh my god. Wait what? Jump. Okay okay and then stop running? Oh this is confusing. It's not late.

57:28.380 --> 57:34.380
What the fuck? Right I need to do like an actual dog in one. This is terrible. I can't, I can't leap.

57:36.540 --> 57:43.340
What the? What am I trying to achieve right now? Jump. Okay and then no stop.

57:43.740 --> 57:49.340
And then go forward again. What the? This is the worst game mode. Okay this is the second

57:49.340 --> 57:55.580
worst game mode after the other one. I can't maintain a lane. It keeps putting me a header behind.

58:00.620 --> 58:07.740
It won't let me maintain a lane. It doesn't matter what it does. You need to control your speed?

58:08.540 --> 58:14.140
How? It wants to constantly put me ahead. I'm trying.

58:19.260 --> 58:21.180
Oh my god. They're only having to attack.

58:23.340 --> 58:28.540
Hold on, hold on, hold on. No we need to do like the walking ones.

58:29.500 --> 58:30.940
And now jump. No forward.

58:35.740 --> 58:41.260
I literally have to start and stop to try and aim for a lane because I can't maintain a speed. It keeps

58:41.260 --> 58:52.700
like putting me ahead. Why is this so delayed as well? No and then it just stops me right before the

58:52.700 --> 59:03.660
coins. Oh come on mate. Brav. Brav. Take a break. Keep a steady pace. Yeah good luck.

59:03.660 --> 59:09.580
Without it I can't do anything. Oh I just dropped my open car controller. You mean that big expensive

59:09.580 --> 59:15.820
piece of equipment? Yeah I just dropped that. What are you going to do then? All right finish, finish.

59:15.900 --> 59:25.580
All right we've done the minigames. What are the other stuff that you can do? There's, there's butt

59:25.580 --> 59:36.700
stuff. And then there's running. We'll run for, I'll take a break and then we'll run and we'll do the

59:36.700 --> 59:42.140
butt set and then we'll do running and then I'll see how I feel because I legit did it. Okay there

59:42.140 --> 59:53.580
we go. I don't sound like I'm halfway across the room now. Hi Refling. Thank you Momo Loh. No she

59:53.580 --> 59:59.500
is just going to be like an English Bulldog lying down and not moving. Yeah apparently those dogs

59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.060
are like resistant to going on walks or something. I don't know. I thought dogs enjoyed walks all the

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:11.820
time. You would get excited for the butt stuff. I don't know what you're talking about Refling.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:20.380
You've done great yeah. I've not bet my record of 186 though. Shock and behavior. Shock and behavior.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:32.060
Shawnee if you get so close after sweating what did he say? Abs incoming better not. I don't want

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:41.260
abs. I want curves. I want hips. I want soft. Please do not beat the record. I mean we might

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:47.420
be in the drawing section. Shawnee's trainer. Shawnee's trainer says you're such a good girl for

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.740
doing your exercise. Keep it up and you can get a special treat. No you're not turning into one of

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:58.220
those two. Nope. You guys had your way with me on the headset whilst I was in the convenience store.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.740
I was trying to service all these customers. No serve the customers not service the customers.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.540
Those are two different sentences in the English language. If English is not your first language

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:15.740
to service serve customers and to service customers are two different things. Please

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:24.540
be careful if English isn't your first language and you use those kind of. I'm so sorry.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:31.900
I was not afraid in slip because I was servicing you guys in the break room.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.940
Damn I'm a customer. Service maximum.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:45.820
You're so goofy. The customers are reeflings all along and you service them? I mean I'm sorry

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:49.100
that was a fun stream. I really enjoyed it. I know it's such a boring game. I probably won't

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:55.180
play it on stream again but it was so fun. I cannot stay long since I'm at work but I hope

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:59.500
you're having fun and getting lots of water. I'm having so much fun. Thank you so much.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:09.580
Thank you for the super chat as well. I cannot stay long. Yes have fun at work hydrate eat.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.860
Are you from Ireland? Because Irish you were Maine.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:24.780
Sorry to burst your bubble meat but I'm Scottish so yeah. Joke didn't land but nice try though.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:30.060
Nice attempt but I am from Scotland. I'm from the other country that kind of sounds like that.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:35.900
Yeah but it was a good one. I'll give you that. I was good. I mean I got a giggle but yeah I'm from

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:45.580
Scotland the other country. Bro ain't leaving scott free. Oh oh good one. I'm killing myself. No

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:52.460
no no no it's fine. I'm across the port. I'm literally across the river. It's not a river

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:58.460
it's a sea but I'm across the sea from Ireland it's fine. Honestly I enjoyed the supermarket stream.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.020
I wouldn't mind doing it again. Ink on this reefing right now.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:09.980
I Scottish you were Maine. That's not even a sentence. What's going on here?

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:17.740
Scottish or Irish? First one to move is gay. Do you really love us? Do you not stick around for

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:26.620
the big watery kiss that I do at the end? Who goes there? Gremble and Anon. Are you squid and

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:33.820

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:42.300
No way that is so good. Thank you for giving me your super cherry. Your super chat cherry not your

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:49.180

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.260
you like guys who got dadboards make me feel a lot better and gives us so much more self confidence.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:58.620
I don't know I just always liked it. I don't know if it's because I like it. Are you squid and mary or whatever.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:06.060
I just gravitate towards it. Yeah. I accidentally called you cunny struggles to a friend and now I

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:14.860
have to correct myself every time I say your name. The gap mo. Rika the gap mo if I had a

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:23.100
lollipop model and I sounded like this. I can't even imagine lightening my Scottish

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:30.300
voice. How did I even do that? Good morning everyone. Good morning everyone. Who's it going?

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:38.540
I'm Stroney Cattles the cunny of Vealour. The European. Oh no wait I see it's European.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:47.900
Oh Vealour. I hope you're ready for another fantastic stream together. That's what you want.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:53.100
No I can't lighten Max then. It doesn't work. It would be so good. The gap mo would be

01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:00.620
perfect aggressive lollipop. No lightening just use the normal voice. Who's it going lads?

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:05.740
And I'm like in a tiny itty bitty body like Emmie. Well I tell you when Emmie was the first

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:11.820
model to be produced so I had to pilot her to make sure she was okay and hearing my voice come

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:17.180
out of this itty bitty adorable little thing and I'm just like how's it going right this is a test

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:23.340
I'm looking left I'm looking right here's an emotion test here's her crying here's her doing this

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:30.700
it was quite it was rather entertaining thank you Rika. I prefer mummy Stroney than lollipop Stroney.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:37.260
Last cunny honestly that would be pretty good instead of do not pass go do not collect 200 bucks

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:48.380
the cunny stops yeah it sounds cunny enough welcome back lollipop get your drawers situated

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:52.300
I'm coming at you oh I've never heard that a sentence that should that should have been my motto

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:58.300
April first Vealour should just switch models do you know how expensive a prank like that would

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:05.260
be are you joking? Truly a dwarf experience. Stroney has piloted Emmie. I piloted everyone

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.980
did I not tell you the secret you know like the shorts that are on everyone's channels like the

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:19.740
early ones not the later ones not like the content ones obviously uh I'm I'm piloting their mix

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:25.420
the girls gave me voice lines and I created the memes for them so like I say doing the isotope

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:33.020
meme where she like blows up the fucking demon core that's me I made that I used her voice

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:39.980
it's me all it's all me but now the girls are starting to do their own stuff like as I said

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.220
like Mersey's most recent shorts I mean these are her on stream like you can't I can't you

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:50.220
pilot a mech when it's her on stream you know what I'm saying she was in every girl's body this is

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:57.180
the truest reason behind her HR absence the best mega pilot of all time the classic April

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:02.300
first joke is to switch models within me and stream on their channel I feel like that would hurt

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:09.420
their channel growth if someone's expecting like cute adorable AC and I pop up and I'm like hi dadas

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:17.660
and my fucking boys oh how's it going oh gee sands oh my voice is just a bit tickly I've got

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:22.620
we tickle in my throat the day are you joking me the oh gee sands would be writing they'd be like

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:31.420
get off the screen get off the stage get out of her account right now I was inside all the girls I

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:40.300
absolutely was there's nothing you can do about it uh reluctantly saying well we know you're all

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:47.180
six of them but we have to keep up the keep up honestly what are you talking about dadas

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:53.820
oh my dear bleeding my heart I can't wait to play this game with you

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:02.780
oh that would be hilarious Scottish face the last of the days I mean get on the maker or

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:07.420
strongly we'll have to go again maybe in the middle of the club so it's not too unexpected

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.940
explains why she has a muppet model do I look like a muppet to you

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:17.340
nah that's what they all do switch and impersonate if someone gets filtered by a joke skillet I

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:27.180
can't wait to play I can't wait to play 24 hours of league I mean honestly the problem is I think

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:31.740
she'd be would have to be me she's the only one that can come close to mimicking a Scottish accent

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.700
so I think it's already confirmed that she was going to be on my channel if we end up doing

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:46.940
a prank is always like that you talking like a zura is so good is it thigh grip oh what's the wrong

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:55.660
little rave ring are you getting your wires crossed I can't I can't guess right right let's do some

01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:01.660
workouts for our gluteus maximus I've had enough of a break I know ironically kind of hope this

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:07.340
I think I would stop functioning if you left even for a prank I mean if one of the girls did go on

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:14.940
my channel I would just stream after they had finished having a go on me and then we can all

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:19.340
have a go on me at the same time you can't see it right now but I'm thrusting in real life I'm

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:26.700
literally spanking your arson your life I'm thrusting I just thought you should know I just thought

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:32.860
you should know the stream is going to be a limited ads will be worth it though

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:38.780
you come sweating over limit that sweat over channel termination that's different that's a

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:46.940
whole other ballpark you can play rhythm game you've not told me what to do right we're doing

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.460
squat okay white squat

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.700
okay let's move

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:13.420
two three five four all right five six seven eight

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.420
Wait, why does it not get full points?

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.420
You're amazing.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.420
Oh, no, no, no, no, raise the arms.

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.420
This is how I'm going to throw up.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.420
Oh!

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.420
Oh, I'm going.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.420
You ain't got nothing on me.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.420
Right, left, right, left, right.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.420
I'm energetic. Are you joking me?

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:41.420
My knees are literally about to hit my nose in the game.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.420
Oh, I'm supposed to bring down the broken arm.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.420
I forgot to bring down the arm.

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:49.420
I just hold the arm up and point in front of you.

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.420
Oops, I didn't bring my arms down.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420
I'm so sorry.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.420
I already got 100 points for that.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.420
What?

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:09.420
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two,

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:23.220

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.580
I'm doing WHAAAT?

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.520
If you wouldn't need a screen, watch the example carefully.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.920
What the hell?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.420
What the heck?

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.580
Okay, I'm on the floor so I'm gonna try to make it open.

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:37.420
What?

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.380
What even is this?

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.220
Are you squeaking?

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.900
I'm on the floor.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:47.900
Bend your knees, hold the ring, squeeze your knees together.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.860
Okay, let's go.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:53.700
Try this, work your butt out.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.020
Oh!

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:55.860
Amazing.

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.700
Oh, take it.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:57.940
Nice.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.780
Take it.

01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.620
Bend it.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.460
Oh.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.300
Great.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.300
Five more.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.140
I get this.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.100
You're almost there.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:05.940
Perfect.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:06.940
Hold on for me.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:07.780
Very nice.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.620
Take it.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.460
Good.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.300
Ah!

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.140
Fine work.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:11.980
You're fine.

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.820
Nice.

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.660
Well done.

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.500
Well done.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Wonderful.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:16.340
What?

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.180
Well.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.020
You made it.

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.340
Oh my god, you took it so well.

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.540
It was fun.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.420
That was insane.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.700
You won't need a screen, just watch the example.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.860
How is it gonna know?

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.860
Set the ring calm down.

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.060
Place both hands on the floor.

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.580
Extend your legs behind you.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.300
Okay, I've done that.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.140
Ah!

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:32.980
Are you squidding me right now?

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:33.820
Are you going to fart?

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.900
Are you serious?

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.820
At some point, we are going to hear

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.580
the Lego dismantling sound effect.

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.580
That was super energetically.

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.260
Oh, we're doing better.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.100
Oh!

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.180
Oh!

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:45.140
I've been doing better.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.700
Right, right, right.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.980
Don't forget to breathe.

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:48.820
I can do it.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.660
I can do it.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.500
I can do it.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.340
Do it.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.380
This is what we're training for.

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:53.220
We're doing fine.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.060
Get in that ear.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:54.900
It's the wide breath.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.740
Right now!

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.580
Ah!

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.420
Left.

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.260
Right.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.100
Right.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:12:59.940
You made it.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.780
Ah!

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.580
Time for a break.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.420
No!

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.700
I want more.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:08.300
Give me more of the reflame.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.020
Okay.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.180
I think I can do better than that.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.660
Sorry, but I do.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.020
Oh, I did it.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:28.980
I think I can do it.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:29.900
I want an A.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.740
Sorry.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.580
I want an A.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.260
I messed up on one of the exercises.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.060
Let me breathe for a second, though.

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.620
I should see the little,

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.260
just see catch my breath and we'll go again.

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.100
Okay?

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:44.940
It's fine.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.420
Fine.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.420
I'm back.

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.740
If only there was a 3D model.

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.580
Oh, boy.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.420
I have good news for you.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.420
If you keep supporting the girls on Patreon.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:55.820
Okay.

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.980
Let me just lower the old heart rate.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.500
I'm guessing I didn't beat my record though.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.540
Thank you Anonymous for the tip again.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.780
You did not get a perfect,

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.260
the sound quality of the thighs.

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.260
Could you hear me thumping?

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.460
I don't know which one of us will need a break after this.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.180
Mommy is a huge, you know, word.

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.900
We were like, didn't we say?

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.500
And he goes, dear Lord,

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.620
she's gone, run fellow replings.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.380
I'll hold her back.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.780
I wouldn't everyone be fighting to hold me back.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.300
I have some water.

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.140
Thank you.

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.500
Oh my God, my little voice is cracking.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.660
I was so fun.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.500
I like that one.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.340
We're doing that one again.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.300
I want an A.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.180
Oh, I said what I said.

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.740
I want an A.

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.700
The wreathlings will hold Johnny back

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.220
so that the snowberries can escape.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.020
The snowberries will try to escape into A.C.'s room.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.860
What are you talking about?

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.140
Try to run that train.

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.020
Everyone would be volunteering to hold you back.

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:08.900
It'd be like the Monty Python scene.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.740
I can take some peril, please.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.460
Just a little bit of peril.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:14.740
Running, yes.

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.180
Running the strunny.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.340
Everyone would stay behind no exceptions for,

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.380
I am the only one that needs to be held back

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.700
and no wreathling left behind.

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.100
We all stand together.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.340
Absolutely ogre.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.580
Right, we're going to retry that one

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.420
because I really like that.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.260
I like that one.

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.340
I think we can get an A.

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:36.900
I don't know if we can get full points

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:37.900
but I can do better than that

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:38.740
because I didn't realise with the arm

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.060
when I was supposed to go.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.060
I mean, yeah, literally this is the first exercise

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.140
I've had since debut.

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.060
If you don't count cycling to the shop,

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:56.660
then she can't outward all of us.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:59.140
Are you sure about that wreathling?

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.100
Literally, my only exercise was walks.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.340
My dad took me to a cafe yesterday

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.580
and I cycled to the shops to get stuff.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.820
That's all I've done.

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.340
Yeah, I thought that's about, oh my God.

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.580
Yeah, I'd like to find out.

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.660
All right, then you're on.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.740
Fuck it.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.300
All right, let's name a convention.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.700
Where and when?

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.100
Once a week ring fit stream

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.460
so mommy doesn't become frail and weak, honestly.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.900
I melt every time you do that.

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:31.900
It's unfair.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.020
Aw.

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.860
Are you scared me right now?

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:36.340
Thank you for becoming.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.340
Thank you for the extended membership.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.380
Love you, love you too, love wreathling.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.860
Thank you for the extended membership.

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.140
I appreciate the support.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.060
It keeps the fun times coming.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.340
Johnny, how much for the sweat

01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.420
pouring off your body right now?

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.700
Ah, squid mirror.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.460
I'll eat that, I'll eat that.

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.860
You didn't melt under the sunlight?

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.500
No, Violet-san, I didn't.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.820
Thank you for the super chat.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.260
I don't know, it's winter.

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.620
There's no sun.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.700
How the hell can she still be at ease

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.540
even when she's out of breath?

01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:17.540
Ha, I'll be on my death bed like,

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:21.940
please just make them ink one more time.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:24.420
And then the poor attendant

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.260
that's been wiping my ass for six months

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.700
because I'm in a care home is gonna be like,

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:30.460
what the fuck is she on about?

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.860
Thank you, Violet-lover, for the super chat.

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.420
But no, I don't melt under the sunlight

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.300
in Australia because there's no sun

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.060
because it's winter.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:43.620
It's summer for pretty much everyone else.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.100
But the hemisphere flips it, okay?

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.140
So it's currently winter for me.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.820
Looks like my name is Funtimes, though.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.140
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or,

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.980
the brain was kicking in.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.580
Shona on her hospital bed, please let me hold it.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.820
I think that video is like 90K views or something,

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:06.660
it seemed like that.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:11.220
I'm like, can you guys make one of the girls' meme videos

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.100
have that much views?

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:12.940
That'd be great.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.620
Funtimes, I can't believe y'all got snow.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.900
Or, or, yes, humid AF, it sucks.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:20.740
There you go.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.020
You know who else sucks?

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:25.540
She was a certified refling milker to the very end.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.540
That is so good.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.540
That is so good.

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:33.140
She's tickling something already and I ain't my tummy.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.940
I mean, if I go in the back door,

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.100
it will be your tummy from the inside out.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.980
Let's try this again, let me stand up.

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.540
Hold on, let me stand up.

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.300
I am going to try hard, so before anyone's like,

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.340
clippable, clippable, no, we're tryharding.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.540
We're tryharding.

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:50.660
I'm taking my headset off,

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.340
that's how much of a tryhard I am.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.060
My hands are off, your turn.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.460
Okay, let's go.

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:03.020
One, push out your chest and keep your back straight.

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:06.220
One, I am, well done.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:10.220
We're tryharding, come on, fantastic.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.220
Right, amazing.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.220
Good, wonderful.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.700
Okay, keep it up.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.540
Very nice.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.660
Maintain the hard work.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:31.940
Six, five, four, three, four, three, two, one.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.780
Amazing, one, left, okay.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.220
Okay, okay, perfect, perfect.

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.220
Okay, okay, let that heart be pumping.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:58.220
Raise both arms, okay, okay, nice.

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.060
Both arms are raised, that repeat.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.380
Move, super energetic.

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:06.380
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.380
Left, left, right, left, right, left, right.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:15.020
Left, can help with abdominal training as well.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:17.940
Left, 20 more, halfway there.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:22.460
Right, left, right, left, right, right, right, right, right.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.260
And then you get 100, and then you get 100.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:30.260
Right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.100
Good, stay focused.

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:34.940
Bring me this combo.

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.300
I promise I'm doing it right.

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.780
No, no, no, no, no, I promise I'm doing it right.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:47.780
Please let me don't do that.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:54.660

One, two, one, two, worry about it.

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.180

Okay, let's move!

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:50.180
Breathe out when you lower your glutes.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.180
Okay!

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.180
Okay, let me get my chair.

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.180
Oh.

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.180
Oh.

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.180
Are you squidding me right now?

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.180
Oh.

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.180
I don't need.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.180
That's all I ever wanted.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.180
Did I beat my heart rate record?

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.180
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.180
I hope not.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.180
Oh, that's so good.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.180
Oh.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:27.180
Oh.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.180
I am so out of it.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.180
No.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.180
I didn't.

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.180
I didn't beat my heart rate.

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.180
I squint my heart rate.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.180
Are you joking?

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.180
Good job, mama.

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:42.180
You did amazing.

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:44.180
Now let us give you a nice little massage

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.180
all over your body to relax you.

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.180
I need a moment.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.180
Hold it.

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.180
Hold it.

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.180
I am so waiting.

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.180
Are you fun?

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.180
I'm actually covered in so air.

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.180
I'll reach the bridge out

01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:55.180
in just a moment.

01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.180
I need a moment.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.180
I need to recalibrate.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:00.180
Oh, moment.

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.180
You're so close.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.180
Just one.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:05.180
Maybe I'm shy.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.180
I feel like throwing up.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.180
That's your body telling me to pump down.

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.180
Okay.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.180
Okay.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.180
I think we're okay.

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.180
Don't wanna throw up.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.180
Oh.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.180
Oh.

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.180
Are you squinting me right now?

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.180
I will read another one.

01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.180
One more.

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:33.180
Mommy needs some.

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.180
Oh.

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.180
I feel sick after that.

01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.180
Oh.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.180
I went all low.

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.180
I don't know if you can tell,

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:46.180
but I went all low on that.

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.180
I'm not doing anymore.

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:49.180
That's me done.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.180
I will feel very well right now.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.180
I'm gonna be honest.

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.180
Is she beyond?

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.180
I'll see if I can redirect into Shiba.

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.180
I think I need to lie that.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.180
I went too far.

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:04.180
Oh.

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:06.180
Where's my Shiba?

01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.180
Oh.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.180
Where's my Shiba?

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.180
Oh.

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.180
Shiba.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.180
Wow.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.180
I'm currently,

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.180
my body is trembling

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:23.180
and I don't know what that means.

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.180
Shiba's on the,

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.180
oh, she has,

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.180
she has, she's gone.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.180
I think she's in her,

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.180
there is.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.180
What?

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.180
Me?

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.180
No, no, no,

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.180
there is.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.180
No, there isn't wrong with being a hag,

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.180
but no other ages.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.180
I went too hard.

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.180
Are you guys okay if I redirect into Emi,

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.180
who's a couple of hours away?

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.180
I think I need to go lie down.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.180
I don't feel very well after that.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.180
Thank you.

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.180
Narrow, anonymous, anonymous.

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.180
And Seida,

01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.180
who's a membership.

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.180
No, 30 minutes.

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.180
I mean,

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.180
Shibi's on holiday.

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.180
She's not here.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.180
Are you okay?

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.180
Yeah.

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.180
Are you okay?

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.180
I'm going to end.

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.180
I'm so sorry.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.180
I don't feel very well.

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.180
I'll see you next time.

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.180
Goodbye.

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.180
Okay.

01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.180
Love you.

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.180
I'll be okay.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.180
Don't worry about me.

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:21.180
Yeah.

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.180
You're getting redirected in Emi.

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.180
She's a couple of hours away,

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.180
but she's there.

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:26.180
Sorry, Reflames.

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.180
I'm sorry.
