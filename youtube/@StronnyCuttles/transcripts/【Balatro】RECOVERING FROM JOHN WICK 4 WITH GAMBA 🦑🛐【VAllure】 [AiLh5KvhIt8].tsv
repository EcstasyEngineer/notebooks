0	22760	It's really bizarre for a full minute, no one can hear me, but then it's fine, I don't
22760	23760	know.
24360	25360	It's rather bizarre.
27360	28360	Rather bizarre indeed.
36360	38360	Oh my God, I got so many comments on my YouTube.
38360	39360	Hold on a minute.
40560	43160	It's just so over for the moment.
45760	46760	I'm spilling.
47960	48960	Okay.
51360	52360	Wait, hold on.
53760	56160	The frickin' Reflins joined membership.
56160	57160	Hold on a minute.
57160	60160	Link322 and Stalkin.
60160	62160	Thank you for the memberships.
62160	65160	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
65160	67160	Can you guys finally see me?
67160	69160	Is it going to register that you guys can see?
69160	70160	Oh thank goodness.
70160	72160	It takes so long for that, right?
72160	75160	Reflins, Reflins, Reflins.
75160	79160	I know normally at any minute we're throwing fists, we're fighting.
79160	83160	I have a very serious, very incredibly.
83560	86560	This is life or death for my channel.
86560	88560	I'm not being funny.
88560	90560	This is life or death for my channel.
90560	91560	What pose?
91560	94560	What pose do you want me pregnant with you?
94560	97560	What pose do you want to be in my tummy in?
97560	99560	This is life or death.
99560	101560	Life or death for this channel.
101560	106560	This channel will pivot and not survive if we do not do this.
106560	107560	Hold on.
107560	108560	I'm opening up a poll.
108560	109560	Hold on.
109560	110560	Hold the phone.
110560	113560	I'm opening up a poll as we speak.
113560	117560	I will change the thumbnail soon TM, but it is so important.
117560	118560	Hold on.
118560	119560	Poll.
119560	120560	Start poll.
120560	125560	What pose for you in my tum tum in my tum tum?
125560	129560	As I spelled that terribly wrong, tum tum.
129560	131560	Pose one.
131560	133560	Pose two.
133560	134560	That's right.
134560	136560	Don't ever say.
136560	139560	Don't ever say you don't eat well at VEAL or headquarters.
139560	141560	I don't want to hear it.
141560	142560	I don't want to hear it.
142560	145560	How am I making this worse?
145560	149560	Literally, you decide the fate of my channel with this one pose alone.
149560	150560	Go.
150560	153560	What pose for you in my tum tum?
153560	154560	You must vote.
154560	155560	Four.
155560	156560	Phil Nelson.
156560	161560	I mean, your technicals can be extended, but the Phil Nelson.
161560	163560	You get too early to do the poll.
163560	165560	More people need to join the stream.
166560	169560	I mean, I stream every single time, at the same time every day.
169560	171560	Bar one day before anyone's like,
171560	173560	Actually, you were the last bell to stream.
173560	175560	You were two hours late.
175560	176560	Actually, no.
176560	179560	I was doing a meeting and everyone's happy and the marshmallows are coming back.
179560	185560	So if you want to send any nice marshmallows to the girls, please be my guest.
185560	189560	Be my guest.
189560	191560	Be my guest.
191560	192560	My guest.
192560	194560	You're welcome to be my guest.
195560	197560	Let's see.
197560	198560	Let's see.
198560	200560	This is what you're drinking.
200560	201560	Cola.
201560	204560	Oh, it's cola.
204560	206560	Wait, is it vote?
206560	215560	Whoa, we have a unanimous, unanimous vote of pose three.
215560	220560	I will relay that to the artist as we speak.
220560	233560	The reeflings have kindly decided that pose three is the most voted for by far.
233560	241560	I would love to see that pose further developed for this commission.
241560	245560	Thank you so much for working so quickly.
245560	251560	Because I didn't realise I was going to get an update so quickly on these options.
251560	253560	I didn't even know I was going to get options.
253560	255560	I sent away a little reference sheet.
255560	257560	Do you want to see the reference sheet?
257560	259560	It's pretty funny.
259560	261560	Right, sorry.
261560	265560	The reeflings have kindly decided that pose three is the most voted for by far.
265560	268560	I would love to see that pose further developed in this commission.
268560	275560	Thank you so much for working on these options and giving me choices.
275560	280560	This has been a fantastic experience so far.
280560	287560	I am very lucky to have found you as an artist.
287560	291560	And before anyone's like, oh, your voice sounds sarcastic when you're typing that.
291560	293560	No, I mean it.
293560	295560	This is what I sent away.
295560	299560	I did not expect at all to get...
299560	302560	Hold on, so that's the image there.
302560	310560	I did not at all expect to get opportunities to even pick a pose further than what I had submitted.
310560	313560	Where the fuck is the image that I just saved?
313560	315560	Oh no. Where is it?
315560	317560	Hold on a minute.
317560	320560	Save image as on desktop is...
320560	324560	It's on the desktop. I can see it when I go to save it again.
324560	326560	There we go.
326560	330560	This is what I sent away the reference as.
330560	334560	This is what...
334560	336560	How else end that pose?
336560	338560	Good morning.
338560	340560	That's what I sent away.
340560	342560	Come on, don't laugh.
342560	344560	I was like, oh come on, got my little reefling.
344560	348560	We got our little placenta line going.
348560	352560	So placenta actually attaches...
352560	357560	I think the placenta sits at any part of the wall in theory.
357560	359560	It can go anywhere.
359560	361560	And I was like, did we put it at the top of the womb?
361560	363560	And I was like, you know what?
363560	365560	No, it can attach at any point.
365560	368560	So we'll just do a straight line coming from my wee reefling.
368560	371560	But yeah, that's the reference I sent away.
371560	376560	And then they very, very kindly gave us those four options.
376560	379560	Those three options, pardon.
379560	382560	And then, yeah, you guys picked three.
382560	385560	So I'm gonna be pregnant with you.
385560	388560	Are you ready to be in my tummy?
388560	391560	I was gonna write the script together.
391560	394560	And then I can say all the adorable things.
394560	398560	I also caught up with my dad and told him how awesome you guys are.
398560	401560	And I was like, dad, guess who played Microsoft?
401560	404560	And he was like, shut the front door.
404560	406560	And I was like, hell, yeah, I didn't.
406560	411560	And I told, I was like, I was telling him about how you used to absolutely wreck and deck.
411560	417560	Also, apparently our Canadian pot smoker isn't called grizzle.
417560	419560	It's gristle. Oops.
419560	421560	So it's gristle.
421560	424560	If you're out there, one Canadian gristle.
424560	427560	Sorry, I've got your gamer tag wrong.
427560	431560	My dad was, oh, he should have seen the disgust on his face when I was like,
431560	434560	oh, I gave a shout out to gristle and everything.
434560	437560	And he was, oh, oh, wrong gamer tag.
437560	441560	Oh, sorry. I wasn't even like two years old at this point.
441560	443560	Like, oh, sorry.
443560	444560	Close enough.
444560	446560	Did you tell him we're getting top seven?
446560	448560	He was laughing at that so hard.
448560	450560	He was like, wait, because no one submitted for it.
450560	453560	And I was like, yeah, because it's such an old game.
453560	458560	But I told him we made VTuber history because I'm the first VTuber to play Microsoft.
458560	460560	Like 99.9% sure.
460560	464560	Unless there's some obscure person hidden in the YouTube algorithm,
464560	468560	we made VTuber history by being the first person to play Microsoft.
468560	470560	So, feels good, man.
470560	474560	I also told them that I've not submitted my note.
474560	476560	I should though, just for the hell of it.
476560	481560	Fuck it. I will. I will. I'll do it after the stream because this is a cool downstream.
481560	484560	If you didn't know, we're not actually playing
485560	487560	Cooking Simulator
487560	490560	or Women Simulator, whatever you want to call it, your choice.
491560	494560	I may or may not be absolutely distraught.
494560	497560	I'm actually going to update the stream thumbnail right now
497560	499560	because I think people generally think I'm sitting on...
499560	501560	Oh, if you heard that.
501560	503560	Oh, my PC didn't like that.
503560	506560	Right, let's pop away the pregnancy for now.
506560	509560	Because I've got something else I want to show you.
510560	514560	Because the streams start coming and they don't stop coming
514560	517560	and the streams start coming and they don't stop coming
517560	520560	and they beg to the room and they hit the ground running.
520560	522560	Didn't make sense not to stretch the bandwidth
522560	526560	because we keep on gaming, but we keep on gaming.
526560	532560	So much to do, so much to see, so much to game, so much to do, so much to game.
533560	536560	Mate, the name of this stream is going to be recovering from
536560	542560	John Wick for Wiccamba.
543560	546560	Remember that time? Do you remember what happened yesterday?
546560	548560	Yeah, I remember. I still remember.
548560	550560	Very vividly what happened.
550560	555560	Not to be confused with vividly, oh, some more, the streamer.
556560	561560	Okay, that should update.
561560	563560	I hope it has felt cultural, right?
563560	569560	Yes, we are going to start the GamerScore grind.
569560	571560	So, things are going to...
571560	574560	We're going to start doing the Xbox GamerScore grind,
574560	576560	starting off with Cameo.
576560	581560	Now, I know we've still got Binding of Isaac tomorrow
581560	583560	and a membership stream of Iron Man.
583560	585560	Guinness, I'm not going to greet during that.
585560	588560	My eyes are still puffy.
588560	590560	Those window noises jump-scared me.
590560	592560	I'm sorry, it was me, it was me.
592560	596560	My PC doesn't like when I download an image for some reason.
596560	599560	It gets all up its arse.
599560	601560	Honestly, it gets its wee panties and leaves in the cliffs
601560	604560	and I'm like, hmm, it needs to be with me.
604560	610560	But yes, we're going to try Stray.
610560	612560	Apparently, it's five hours long.
612560	614560	Cameo is roughly eight hours split,
614560	617560	so I'm going to try and be a bit easier on myself
617560	619560	with these endurance streams,
619560	621560	especially because there's a few things...
621560	622560	Oh, a secret.
622560	624560	Thank you for the five gifted memberships.
624560	627560	Congrats to those who caught it with their face.
627560	631560	Make sure to interact with chat
631560	633560	because I think there's a prompt that says
633560	635560	to accept GIFs on channels for some reason.
635560	637560	It just doesn't happen automatically.
637560	638560	I don't know.
638560	645560	But, yes, what am I doing?
645560	646560	I don't know.
646560	648560	Oh my God, it's officially...
648560	649560	Hold on, wait.
649560	652560	I might even have a further thing to show you
652560	657560	if I have it, if it's lurking in the shadows.
657560	658560	Yes, there is...
658560	660560	Oh, I do have it, I do have it.
660560	662560	Okay, you might hear the windows sound.
662560	664560	It's my computer, not yours.
664560	665560	It's my computer.
665560	667560	Okay, it's my computer.
667560	669560	One last thing to show you,
669560	672560	and then we'll get Gambon to make myself feel better.
672560	674560	Wow, I've spoken like a true addict.
674560	675560	Holy crap.
675560	678560	It has been...
678560	680560	Why is it locked?
680560	682560	Unlock yourself right now.
682560	687560	It has been almost one month of streams,
687560	689560	and here we are, a little refluence.
689560	690560	Here we are.
690560	692560	Can you tell?
692560	695560	I like streaming, question mark.
695560	698560	I'll swap out the runescape key.
698560	700560	But it's been one month.
700560	702560	I'm going to tweet this out.
702560	704560	I'm going to tweet it out with my YouTube statistics
704560	706560	and just be like, thank you for anyone
706560	710560	and everyone who interacted with me.
710560	715560	It has been nothing short of a complete pleasure
715560	717560	to be able to do this.
717560	720560	Nothing short of a complete pleasure,
720560	723560	pure happiness, pure, pure vibes,
723560	725560	whatever you want to call it.
725560	727560	It has been nothing but fantastic.
727560	729560	I'm very happy.
729560	730560	Those are all the streams.
730560	733560	I will swap out the part five for my new one
733560	736560	because technically I didn't do the part five runescape.
736560	742560	But yes, we are in, please do not be mistaken
742560	745560	in thinking that, oh no, it's going to slow down now.
745560	747560	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
747560	749560	Mommy built different.
749560	751560	I can't believe it's already been a dad stream
751560	753560	more than some streamers in a year, be honest.
753560	755560	Hold on, let me take a drink of cola
755560	757560	and then let me finish off my tea.
764560	769560	But yes, I have had an absolutely fantastic month.
769560	771560	I'm sure all the girls will absolutely agree
771560	774560	and say we've had just beyond immeasurable
775560	777560	happiness success.
777560	780560	When I go off of stream, like once I finish this stream,
780560	784560	everyone's debut highlights are going up as well.
784560	787560	I'm going to put some advertising money back
787560	790560	and behind it as well just to help the girls out
790560	794560	with their growth because I've got a goal
794560	796560	for them to achieve this month
796560	798560	and obviously I need to enable them.
798560	802560	I need to enable their human, I was going to say
802560	804560	I was going to say humidities
804560	807560	for the implication of cookies.
807560	809560	I don't know why.
809560	811560	It only goes even faster from here.
811560	814560	The second thumbnail exposing VLR.
814560	816560	Oh, did you like it?
816560	818560	Thanks, I made it myself.
818560	820560	I'm just so good.
820560	822560	I'm just so MLG Pro, honestly.
822560	826560	Oh, that's my game capture, please don't.
826560	830560	Wait, my game capture is in mine.
831560	833560	It's because I'm dumb.
833560	836560	But yes, it's been a fantastic month.
836560	839560	Next month, I'm going to be pregnant with you in my belly.
839560	841560	Next month, my...
841560	844560	Right, actually hold on, hold on, let's discuss this.
844560	848560	While we're busy fighting and off all the time,
848560	852560	I actually do need to discuss the length of streams
852560	855560	coming up in Dru...
855560	857560	Where the frick?
858560	861560	I now have two of these.
861560	863560	Am I okay?
863560	865560	I don't think so.
865560	868560	Okay, well, if it's that one,
868560	871560	right, we need to discuss
871560	873560	or we need to bring about.
873560	875560	So my dad's coming over, I'm not hitting the fact.
875560	877560	My dad's coming.
877560	879560	My dad's coming to see me.
880560	883560	So, why does time go faster every year?
883560	885560	Isn't that not like a relatively...
885560	888560	Fainting the finished Elden Ring DLC?
888560	891560	Oh yeah, you're going to carry me later when we play it again.
894560	897560	I've never played Spiral.
897560	900560	I think I might have played it as a child,
900560	902560	but I do not remember it.
902560	904560	I think maybe my dad played it, but even he said,
904560	906560	like, I'm not even sure about that.
906560	908560	And I'm like, maybe I just made it up
908560	910560	and watched people play it as a child.
910560	913560	Your dad, yeah, you're going to meet your father-in-law.
913560	915560	I'm not sure.
915560	917560	I might bring him on stream for like five seconds,
917560	919560	but all you're going to hear is
919560	921560	for the love of effing God.
921560	923560	Do not say my legal name, my name is Strani.
923560	925560	Okay, don't say anything.
925560	927560	And he'll be like, hi, Radish boys.
927560	929560	And I'm like, no, they're called Raeflings, dad!
929560	931560	Raeflings!
931560	933560	Mail on stream.
933560	935560	Oh, for fuck's sake.
935560	937560	Then he start mail on stream if it's my dad.
937560	940560	I will fucking have a riot.
942560	945560	If someone fucking goes mail on stream,
945560	948560	drop, because my fucking dad shows up on stream.
948560	950560	Oh my God, I'm fighting phantoms right now.
950560	952560	I'm ready to swing on my chair.
952560	954560	I'm fighting phantoms.
954560	956560	Lou phantoms dans ma chambre.
956560	958560	Chambre, fuck.
958560	960560	Man, I'm such a fake Frenchie.
962560	964560	New nickname, we're Radish boys.
964560	966560	It was your old nickname.
968560	970560	It was your old nickname
970560	972560	when you were in the cryo pod,
972560	974560	but now you're called Raeflings, r-e-e-e-e.
974560	976560	Raeflings.
976560	978560	Already fighting them visibly,
978560	980560	but literally the phantom's in my room right now.
980560	982560	The phantom's dans ma chambre,
982560	984560	in my room, in my bedroom,
984560	986560	and to be specific.
988560	990560	Mmm.
990560	992560	Yes, but for the next
992560	994560	three weeks,
994560	996560	ash,
996560	998560	there's not going to be too many
998560	1000560	endurance streams, because
1000560	1002560	so my dad said the first few days
1002560	1004560	he's going to not even be
1004560	1006560	on the same time zone.
1006560	1008560	I don't even know if he's going to be awake.
1008560	1010560	He's probably going to be awake while I'm streaming.
1010560	1012560	Oh my God, oh he's going to be here
1012560	1014560	and has like all our ridiculous conversations.
1014560	1016560	Um, but it's fine.
1016560	1018560	It's fine.
1018560	1020560	My dad laughs
1020560	1022560	and he finds it funny.
1022560	1024560	You can just pre-record a segment.
1024560	1026560	Probably. The phantom's have got
1026560	1028560	to fight my mental illness.
1028560	1030560	Bro, I'm pheromone maxing right now.
1030560	1032560	I'm fucking disgusting. I'm so greasy.
1032560	1034560	I smell V.O.
1034560	1036560	I was going to have a shower
1036560	1038560	after John went.
1038560	1040560	Uh, the reason why I don't have any news
1040560	1042560	other than what I've just shown
1042560	1044560	is because I did nothing yesterday
1044560	1046560	after the stream. I was so distraught.
1046560	1048560	I was so distraught. I didn't have
1048560	1050560	a shower. I went to bed.
1050560	1052560	I had a nap. I woke up.
1052560	1054560	I ended up binging to
1054560	1056560	TikTok for four hours.
1056560	1058560	Um, I'm literally pheromone maxing
1058560	1060560	right now and then I went back to sleep
1060560	1062560	because I felt so bad after
1062560	1064560	watching that film.
1064560	1066560	Uh,
1066560	1068560	so let's just say no emotional
1068560	1070560	films. No films I have any
1070560	1072560	emotional little
1072560	1074560	things.
1074560	1076560	Literally I didn't even eat. I've still not eaten
1076560	1078560	since I had the past, was it
1078560	1080560	pasta? Left over pasta with you
1080560	1082560	yesterday. On Rinscape
1082560	1084560	that's the last time I've eaten because I've
1084560	1086560	been so distraught.
1086560	1088560	I'm such a cry baby.
1088560	1090560	I can't even eat.
1090560	1092560	Um,
1092560	1094560	no I'm not even hungry. That's the thing.
1094560	1096560	Thank you Jake Norman for coming
1096560	1098560	out. Member!
1098560	1100560	Uh, our membership streams for the week.
1100560	1102560	Classic script writing. You guys are going to tell me what you want to hear again.
1102560	1104560	We're going to do a
1104560	1106560	the plot has already been picked out slightly.
1106560	1108560	Um, it's going to be a choose your own
1108560	1110560	adventure kind of plot.
1110560	1112560	But we will be
1112560	1114560	publicly writing
1114560	1116560	ASMR collabs with
1116560	1118560	VR.
1118560	1120560	I have five one-on-one collabs planned
1120560	1122560	with the girls. I'm not even told the girls yet.
1122560	1124560	Uh, I'm just doing it. I'm just bombing into their DMs
1124560	1126560	being like hey, how's it going?
1126560	1128560	Actually, out of raw
1128560	1130560	curiosity did that Rinscape stream
1130560	1132560	get limited ads for
1132560	1134560	the language I was using
1134560	1136560	because there was no in-game audio or voices.
1136560	1138560	Wow!
1138560	1140560	My John Wick stream was fine.
1140560	1142560	I literally constantly went
1142560	1144560	and said
1144560	1146560	pretty
1146560	1148560	pretty outrageous stuff.
1148560	1150560	Not going to lie.
1150560	1152560	The banks were mentioned at one point
1152560	1154560	and then the banks became the high table.
1154560	1156560	So from now on
1156560	1158560	the high table is how we
1158560	1160560	reference the banks, okay?
1160560	1162560	Um,
1162560	1164560	eat when you're ready and hungry.
1164560	1166560	Yeah.
1166560	1168560	I'm fine. No, no, that's fine.
1168560	1170560	She's sad girl Maxine for real, for real.
1170560	1172560	Um, if you
1172560	1174560	didn't make it for yesterday's stream
1174560	1176560	um,
1176560	1178560	I want to say John Wick
1178560	1180560	spoilers.
1180560	1182560	Maybe?
1182560	1184560	Uh, is it for the first 30 minutes
1184560	1186560	you're not allowed to say anything bad? Well, I'm pretty sure
1186560	1188560	like I was just straight out coming out
1188560	1190560	with the sentences like we should be
1190560	1192560	where the banks and stuff and I'm like
1192560	1194560	hold on a minute, isn't usually going to have problems
1194560	1196560	with us?
1196560	1198560	Yeah, I think I know.
1198560	1200560	I'm going to finish that
1200560	1202560	in the movie. I had to put, oh.
1202560	1204560	Okay, I'm not spoiling nothing.
1204560	1206560	If you've not watched John Wick
1206560	1208560	if you've not
1208560	1210560	watched John Wick, you're welcome to watch me
1210560	1212560	um, create
1212560	1214560	Wines whilst watching the movie.
1214560	1216560	Um, do not whatever you do
1216560	1218560	up to the end of the VOD
1218560	1220560	for any reason, even though
1220560	1222560	the movie isn't displayed in the stream
1222560	1224560	uh, you'll be able to hear in my voice
1224560	1226560	what happened.
1226560	1228560	Uh, should know. Don't, don't do that.
1228560	1230560	Don't do that. Uh, yes. So there's going to be
1230560	1232560	a few shorter streams but
1232560	1234560	with these shorter streams that are coming up in
1234560	1236560	July there's going to be a lot more
1236560	1238560	consistency, I repeat a lot more
1238560	1240560	consistency with ASMR uploads.
1240560	1242560	So it's like a reward
1242560	1244560	less mummy equals more mummy
1244560	1246560	more mummy equals less mummy.
1246560	1248560	Yeah?
1248560	1250560	That makes sense.
1250560	1252560	There's the, there's more of me.
1254560	1256560	There's, okay, this, I don't know
1256560	1258560	why this didn't pop, but here we go.
1258560	1260560	Re-roll the shop a total of
1260560	1262560	100 times and we've got Re-rolls
1262560	1264560	cost 2 bucks left. Didn't we not already have
1264560	1266560	that?
1266560	1268560	Play a total of 300. Wait, why is
1268560	1270560	this popping now? Re-face
1270560	1272560	all, uh
1272560	1274560	Re-triggers all played face cards.
1274560	1276560	That's a curious one.
1276560	1278560	That could be used in combination.
1278560	1280560	Spend a total of 2.5 in the shops.
1280560	1282560	Woah!
1282560	1284560	One extra card slot
1284560	1286560	available in the shop. That's curious.
1286560	1288560	It doesn't make sense, but more mummy
1288560	1290560	means more happy. Yes, there's a
1290560	1292560	few things I wish to execute this month.
1292560	1294560	Wow, uh, as an
1294560	1296560	execute plans, not as an execute
1296560	1298560	the high table.
1298560	1300560	Um,
1300560	1302560	planets appear 4 times more
1302560	1304560	likely. Buy a total.
1304560	1306560	Okay. Wow!
1306560	1308560	Jeez, Louise!
1308560	1310560	First thing in the morning
1310560	1312560	you want to do that to me? Right.
1312560	1314560	Dev's getting a message right now.
1316560	1318560	Dev's getting a message. Continue!
1320560	1322560	Oh, uh, I think
1322560	1324560	this is, uh, yeah, we've got our token.
1324560	1326560	We've got our token.
1326560	1328560	Um, we won, we won, we won.
1328560	1330560	That's the main thing. Okay.
1330560	1332560	Well, actually, I've got a f***ing force behind me.
1334560	1336560	So today we're having an easy day.
1336560	1338560	When I get off stream, all the girls are going to have
1338560	1340560	highlights, um,
1340560	1342560	uploaded, debut highlights
1342560	1344560	uploaded to their channel.
1344560	1346560	I'm also going to put some advertisement in it.
1346560	1348560	Uh, I'm not putting any advertisement
1348560	1350560	in me. This is actually just straight up
1350560	1352560	internal veiler.
1352560	1354560	This is just straight up veiler
1354560	1356560	internal communications.
1356560	1358560	I don't put advertisements on my content,
1358560	1360560	but I put it on the girls' content
1360560	1362560	because I want to push them, not me.
1362560	1364560	This is just straight up comms. I need to shut the f*** up.
1364560	1366560	I'm, like, literally, uh,
1366560	1368560	a nightmare. Hold on. I did not
1368560	1370560	read what this
1370560	1372560	pack had. Hold on.
1372560	1374560	Oh no, what's
1374560	1376560	going with my Wii game?
1376560	1378560	Have I broken it?
1380560	1382560	Oh no.
1382560	1384560	Prevents death of chip scored
1384560	1386560	are at least 24 of the required.
1386560	1388560	It's just still...
1388560	1390560	Oh wow.
1390560	1392560	What's...
1392560	1394560	Okay, I think it's having a wee
1394560	1396560	melty, but that's okay. You're looking to have a melty.
1396560	1398560	Yo, look, it's
1398560	1400560	shiny. Just shows her backdoor,
1400560	1402560	honestly. Tire cards appear four times more
1402560	1404560	frequently. Okay.
1404560	1406560	Discover 25 blinds.
1406560	1408560	Okay. Re-roll boss blinds.
1408560	1410560	Unlimited times. Okay, okay.
1410560	1412560	Right, um, I'm actually going to have
1412560	1414560	to exit this run,
1414560	1416560	uh, because I didn't pay attention to what
1416560	1418560	the deck was. Hold on. Let's check...
1418560	1420560	Let's check out the deck rolls.
1420560	1422560	New run. At
1422560	1424560	end of each round, $2
1424560	1426560	per remaining hand,
1426560	1428560	$1 per discard, so
1428560	1430560	no interest. So there's no point in holding
1430560	1432560	on to economy on the green deck.
1432560	1434560	Curious.
1434560	1436560	Initial cards and booster packs are
1436560	1438560	free. That could definitely
1438560	1440560	throw us ahead quite
1440560	1442560	quite
1442560	1444560	a lot.
1444560	1446560	That's going to throw us ahead quite a lot, so
1446560	1448560	I'm going to take it, because we are... was it
1448560	1450560	10, 9, 8, 7, 6
1450560	1452560	straight.
1452560	1454560	Well, if the girl succeeds, you succeed. Yes.
1454560	1456560	I...
1456560	1458560	I've kind of touched up on this.
1458560	1460560	I have done everything I want to
1460560	1462560	do. Um,
1462560	1464560	I'm just happy to be back. I'm happy to be
1464560	1466560	making content, following my goofy ideas.
1466560	1468560	I mean, like, hell, who the fuck thinks
1468560	1470560	of pregnancy ASMR?
1470560	1472560	Um, like,
1472560	1474560	I just want to do that kind of stuff.
1474560	1476560	Like, that's where my focus is.
1476560	1478560	And making, like, funny shorts
1478560	1480560	and having a good time. Like, that's
1480560	1482560	where it's... that's what it's
1482560	1484560	all about. Earn a dollar for each
1484560	1486560	nine in your full deck. That's so specific.
1486560	1488560	Right, two booster cards.
1488560	1490560	What's the dealio? What's the dealio?
1490560	1492560	A straight...
1492560	1494560	What?
1494560	1496560	Four plus multiplier
1496560	1498560	for each card.
1498560	1500560	Below?
1500560	1502560	What does that mean?
1502560	1504560	So...
1504560	1506560	So, I can't use that one.
1506560	1508560	Uh...
1508560	1510560	If I play a straight... I mean...
1510560	1512560	You want
1512560	1514560	to cut cards. It's good for a thin deck.
1514560	1516560	Yeah, you got a thin deck.
1516560	1518560	Yeah, you got a thin deck.
1518560	1520560	Yeah, you got a thin deck.
1520560	1522560	Yeah, you got a thin deck.
1522560	1524560	Yeah, that joker is in...
1524560	1526560	Um, removing cards is actually
1526560	1528560	good.
1530560	1532560	I don't have death, though.
1532560	1534560	I don't know, maybe three
1534560	1536560	times multiplier for a straight, though.
1536560	1538560	I think if we could grab
1538560	1540560	that voucher that has
1540560	1542560	the...
1542560	1544560	one, two, skip a few.
1544560	1546560	I want one, two,
1546560	1548560	skip a few.
1548560	1550560	Yeah.
1550560	1552560	Reminder, there's no point
1552560	1554560	of holding on to economy. I'm sure
1554560	1556560	I just... three times multiplier
1556560	1558560	is insane.
1558560	1560560	Oh wait, multiplier at the end?
1560560	1562560	Well, not that the rest even affect it.
1562560	1564560	Yeah,
1564560	1566560	simplifying your deck for consistency
1566560	1568560	is a way for a better run. Me who just
1568560	1570560	fucking picked that order. Okay,
1570560	1572560	well, I've done it now.
1572560	1574560	The pillar, cards played previously
1574560	1576560	or debuff, that's fine.
1576560	1578560	Right, a straight.
1578560	1580560	An ace,
1580560	1582560	a king, a queen, a jack
1582560	1584560	and a ten.
1584560	1586560	Oh my god, what?
1586560	1588560	That's so weird.
1590560	1592560	Oh, you just do that then
1592560	1594560	and throw away the ace.
1594560	1596560	You're going for
1596560	1598560	straights during Pride Month?
1598560	1600560	Damn straight ass.
1600560	1602560	That's terrible. Don't laugh at that.
1602560	1604560	That's terrible.
1604560	1606560	Kings and queens.
1608560	1610560	Full house, kings and queens.
1610560	1612560	Okay.
1612560	1614560	That was a joke, by the way. Relax
1614560	1616560	snowflake, it's called humor.
1618560	1620560	Relax.
1620560	1622560	Okay, the straights aren't going very well.
1624560	1626560	What do you do?
1626560	1628560	Bakes?
1628560	1630560	Right, let's try and get
1630560	1632560	a few...
1632560	1634560	Let me get a few high
1634560	1636560	high straights.
1636560	1638560	Wait, what's a straight again?
1638560	1640560	It's when it goes one, two, three, four.
1640560	1642560	Five. Yeah, because when it's a flush
1642560	1644560	it's all the same color. Yeah, okay.
1644560	1646560	I got it, I got it, I got it.
1646560	1648560	Hi, thank you for joining.
1648560	1650560	Thank you for anyone for showing up.
1650560	1652560	I do understand that I stream a bit extreme.
1652560	1654560	I stream a bit extreme.
1654560	1656560	I don't know, do we just... how much should we go?
1656560	1658560	320 blazer.
1658560	1660560	I mean, we could just get rid of these
1660560	1662560	and then throw that four away
1662560	1664560	and see what happens.
1664560	1666560	I think we're going to make it. Hold on, how much money do we get?
1668560	1670560	I have made a great
1670560	1672560	human error.
1672560	1674560	Oh lord, I have made a great
1674560	1676560	human error.
1676560	1678560	What do I need? A queen? I only have
1678560	1680560	one more queen in the deck.
1680560	1682560	I have made
1682560	1684560	a great error.
1684560	1686560	What do I need? A
1686560	1688560	10 and a queen.
1688560	1690560	That's an eight and a six.
1690560	1692560	Wait, so I need a seven. What are seven?
1692560	1694560	Okay, the odds of me pulling a seven are so high.
1694560	1696560	Nine, seven, eight,
1696560	1698560	six, five.
1698560	1700560	Discard and pray.
1700560	1702560	Oh my god, I've completely messed up.
1702560	1704560	I have to get rid of this.
1706560	1708560	I'm sorry, I do.
1708560	1710560	I have to get rid of the high.
1710560	1712560	I don't have much highs. The odds of
1712560	1714560	I was going to say the odds of highs are so rubbish.
1714560	1716560	Okay, 10, nine,
1716560	1718560	eight, seven, six,
1718560	1720560	zero.
1722560	1724560	Okay. That was pure
1724560	1726560	probability. That was pure probability.
1726560	1728560	Please, can we get the Joker that does that
1728560	1730560	thing where it does the thing?
1730560	1732560	That would be great.
1732560	1734560	Okay, we are going to...
1736560	1738560	Oh, that's not bad.
1738560	1740560	That's not bad. Retriggers all face cards.
1740560	1742560	So if I happen to get a flush with a face,
1742560	1744560	a target card and three playing
1744560	1746560	cards.
1748560	1750560	Forget, forget.
1750560	1752560	Something's better than nothing at this stage.
1752560	1754560	Okay, let's go next.
1754560	1756560	Oh, a Joker slot.
1756560	1758560	I'm in.
1758560	1760560	I'm in.
1760560	1762560	When they do it like this, it gets so tricky.
1766560	1768560	And then hope for a king and a tent to come flying
1768560	1770560	back into my hands.
1770560	1772560	Surely. Hydration check.
1772560	1774560	How do we call them?
1774560	1776560	Surprised you didn't go for the two, three, four and five.
1776560	1778560	I was feeling quirky. Okay.
1778560	1780560	It was, I was feeling quirky.
1780560	1782560	I got a fill house.
1784560	1786560	Wait, what's the fill...
1786560	1788560	Oh, you want me to go for fill house?
1788560	1790560	Fuck it.
1790560	1792560	Okay, but we're not going to get a flush from doing this.
1792560	1794560	How much do we get?
1794560	1796560	Sugar.
1798560	1800560	King, queen, jack.
1800560	1802560	So what, ten and nine?
1802560	1804560	Or seven, six, five.
1804560	1806560	Oh my gosh.
1806560	1808560	Just completely re-roll.
1810560	1812560	I'm going to fail.
1812560	1814560	I've got three hands.
1814560	1816560	Wait, I've only made a third.
1816560	1818560	No, we're going to have to start discarding
1818560	1820560	for a royal flush.
1820560	1822560	A royal straight.
1822560	1824560	Oh, don't do this to me now, game.
1830560	1832560	Unless I play a double here,
1832560	1834560	like double jack and double king.
1836560	1838560	The video lore girls get a little quirky at night.
1840560	1842560	More like being cheeky and nearly got clapped
1842560	1844560	for literally the first game in
1844560	1846560	and absolutely wrecking myself.
1848560	1850560	Okay, that's exactly what I was hoping for.
1850560	1852560	Let's go.
1852560	1854560	A straight. Let's go.
1854560	1856560	And it gets to play again on the big boys.
1856560	1858560	Okay.
1858560	1860560	Looks like I want everything to be royal.
1862560	1864560	Cloud nine gave us a cheeky four bucks
1864560	1866560	on top as well, remaining discards.
1866560	1868560	Yeah? Okay.
1868560	1870560	Whoa, who are you?
1870560	1872560	At first hand, a round is a single six.
1872560	1874560	Destroy it to create a spectral card.
1874560	1876560	Sure, you're free.
1876560	1878560	I'll take you.
1878560	1880560	Right.
1880560	1882560	We're investing in straights.
1882560	1884560	Which is...
1884560	1886560	Ah, not here.
1886560	1888560	Lucky me. It's not here.
1888560	1890560	Because why would it be here?
1890560	1892560	A straight flush?
1892560	1894560	That's so unlikely. Sorry.
1894560	1896560	I don't know who ever...
1896560	1898560	I don't know why you would play for that.
1898560	1900560	Unless like you maybe got some spectral packs
1900560	1902560	that like completely...
1902560	1904560	Uranis?
1904560	1906560	Fine, I picked Uranis.
1906560	1908560	I'm not like the other cuttlefish.
1908560	1910560	I get clapped.
1910560	1912560	I get clapped for my mistakes in Vulture.
1912560	1914560	Choose one of up to three turrets.
1914560	1916560	Hmm...
1916560	1918560	It's not looking good.
1918560	1920560	I'm needing something a bit better.
1920560	1922560	I'm not like other steamers.
1922560	1924560	I get clapped at the convention
1924560	1926560	by the replays.
1926560	1928560	What the fuck? I need to stop.
1928560	1930560	I need to stop. That was terrible.
1930560	1932560	Discard to re...
1932560	1934560	Also me, I wonder why we got uninvited
1934560	1936560	from that one convention?
1936560	1938560	Discard to random cards in the played hand.
1938560	1940560	That's fine.
1940560	1942560	Oh no, it's not because I'm going for straights.
1942560	1944560	And a played hand
1947520	1952240	Queen yep, yep, okay straight show me how you work
1955680	1958480	Okay, okay, okay, let him get up let him get up
1959760	1964320	So we just need a ten which we have three remaining odds of ten or high
1966800	1969680	Which we have three remaining odds of ten or high
1970640	1972640	Okay, there we go. That's all we needed
1975200	1977200	I need the card that lets you jump yes
1977360	1983360	We found it the other day, but we we had already maxed out on pairs should have to all my pairs
1984160	1986160	um
1986720	1989280	Earned four bucks or an extra discard
1992400	1994400	I mean
1995600	1997600	Four bucks
1997600	2004960	We'll grab voucher first clearance sale not we uh, I have one space remaining
2009760	2013760	Got a dip best of luck always risk the big play thank you
2014240	2019120	I'm wondering if we should get rid of eight ball for an extra discard because if we're going for straights
2019120	2021120	We need to be able to throw stuff away
2021280	2030160	I'm sorry if that's the wrong move, but it's my dumb move to make okay. Never gonna upgrade streets
2032240	2035200	Oh Saturn is a straight Saturn yes
2036560	2042720	And ring ring uh, you know what fuck it. Let's go for a turret. There's no such thing as interest so oh
2045280	2047280	We can do Saturn again
2047280	2051680	Absolutely, absolutely and you come right that worked out very well
2053200	2055680	Uh next base shop joker is
2056400	2064480	Polychrome and 1.5 multiplier. That's definitely worth it. I think I think let's find out
2066720	2070160	Discard is good for finding straights it is i'm
2070480	2072480	I
2075120	2081280	Know it's very painful doing it like this, but if we get a high flush this uh, whoever it is. Where are you?
2083360	2086000	If first hand of round is a single six
2087360	2089360	Destroy it. No, I don't have a six
2090080	2092400	um
2092400	2098800	Yeah, this times three and we just levelled up straight. So we'll go for a royal. I know it looks crazy
2099040	2101040	I know it looks absolutely
2102400	2106960	Terrible thrown away, but are you joking me right now?
2111840	2113840	Are you serious
2117200	2119200	Are we hello
2123440	2125440	Hello
2129120	2135520	This game has nothing but the audacity
2138560	2140080	Are you kidding me right now?
2140080	2141600	I literally
2141600	2147760	Five discards and I couldn't get a high card and the queen still hasn't shown up. I think I might have just thrown that
2149840	2155520	Because all we needed was a high flush. I threw everything I had five discards for a high flush
2156480	2160640	Nine eight seven six five. Oh well. We need pray that this is going to do some work
2161440	2163440	Are you kidding me?
2163440	2168000	Okay, thank goodness. Are you joking? You could have played the six
2169280	2171840	Eats. I need to jump. Whoa, who are you?
2173120	2175120	Okay, I will use you
2175360	2178880	Um, right. I'm going to keep the extra discard. Uh, I guess
2179040	2187120	You're in a dollar for each nine and no air and just straight up four bucks. Wait, who?
2190320	2194800	Oh, these are the exact same right get rid of you and you come. Yeah, you go to the right
2196480	2201520	You'll do your thing. All right, and then we're doing tariffs. Okay, tarot tarot card
2202480	2204480	little wild card
2205040	2207920	multipliers, I think we're gonna have to ask
2208880	2210880	Let's do this
2211200	2214560	Here we go. Here we go and you come and you come
2216320	2219360	The hybrophant the planet
2221440	2225760	Left to right. Okay, we're gonna take a low and make it a queen now
2227440	2229440	The left card turns into the right card
2230000	2233760	We're gonna really try and max up on the high straights
2234560	2236560	create tarot card
2236720	2240800	If poker hand contains an ace and a straight
2244240	2246720	That is ridiculously difficult so
2247200	2252400	Um, no, I'm gonna keep my economy for now. I know there's no interest
2252880	2256480	Oh, maybe I shouldn't must play five cards. Don't have to tell me twice
2258160	2261600	10 9 8 7 6 5
2262560	2264560	Mmm
2265760	2268400	It honestly looks like I have a better chance of doing low
2275600	2278080	Drop play the six
2280480	2283520	An ace two three four five equals a straight
2285440	2291040	Oh wait, hold on play the six play the six pause the dunes a first hand of round is a single six destroy it
2291600	2293200	Destroy it
2293200	2296560	Destroy it to create a spectral card. Does that mean discard?
2297920	2300960	If first hand of round is a single six destroy it
2306400	2308400	Motherfucker
2309520	2312800	What did that mean destroy it are you from here?
2317760	2319760	I said destroy it
2321840	2325360	The first hand not the first discard a folk sick
2326240	2332240	It's too early in the morning for this. Hold on right king queen. Oh my god. Never get all the royals are coming out
2334160	2336880	Oh, we need a jack then
2338960	2343360	We would need a jack to go either way a jack or a ace
2347760	2350880	I said a jack
2352560	2354560	Or an ace
2355760	2359520	Okay, ace king queen jack ten
2362800	2368640	I don't know why this game doesn't like me. I'm just trying my oh, I've got 14k for that. Okay that popped off
2369040	2375200	We're gonna be definitely investing in turrets. I'm gonna reroll. What are you rerolls cost two bucks less
2375840	2377840	You'll never guess what I want you
2378560	2381360	Iron five bucks for every four discards rank
2382160	2383280	changes
2383280	2385280	no
2385440	2389280	Game if you play astray. I mean that does compliment me
2395200	2398320	I'll destroy the six so there'll be new sixes. Oh, I get it now
2399200	2401200	Right turret cartoon
2402160	2404160	The chariot
2404720	2406640	Enhances the steel
2406640	2408640	converts the diamond a wild cat
2409680	2413280	Uh destroy up to two selected cards. Did we destroy low?
2414560	2416080	No
2416080	2418080	maybe
2418640	2420640	Three three four four four and four
2422400	2428640	I've got two. Oh, but that's a seven. It's like smack bang in the middle of the deck. It's not even lower numbers
2429440	2435040	Yeah, they're not they're not low enough spades steel. The best I got is a steel card steel card
2435760	2437760	How many who's who have I got the most of
2438640	2444720	A queen's the t-stat clea. I'm gonna oh wait both these queens are already special. Um, it's a wild card
2444720	2446720	Can't be used in any suit. No
2447760	2450400	You want the six to spectral you want the six?
2451680	2456160	It's turned into a steel. Are you on the ace to be a steel? I've got extra uses
2456640	2457840	I do
2457840	2462320	Didn't see this is why you guys are better playing this game than me because you guys spot stuff. I never look at
2463200	2466960	I'm like, oh, oh, I can't see it. What are you talking about recently?
2467840	2471360	What are you talking about right glass? I don't like glass because I don't want it to break
2472080	2478960	It increases the rank of two selected cards. I absolutely believe that's probably the best
2481200	2483200	Thing to utilize so
2483680	2488400	Oh, let's make a few things higher nine
2492000	2494000	Nine and eight let's bring it them up
2494080	2499760	I know I want things to be closer to a face card, but I don't want to completely negate the 10
2500400	2502400	Maybe eight and seven
2503200	2505200	Keep the nine
2505600	2507840	Eight and seven kind of push the deck higher
2508080	2513760	We've got two lore here and we want to push the deck upwards so we're more likely to roll higher

2911360	2913360	I
2913840	2916960	Red seal let's put it on a king then. I'll keep up
2918800	2924160	Uh, okay three times multi if a poker is already. Oh, wow. He's actually pretty good as well
2925920	2929840	But every I am quite happy with everything I've got right now
2931680	2934320	I mean, I guess the next weakest card we
2935200	2939520	Have is technically retriggers socks and buskin
2941920	2945440	But we're not even we're getting 75 000 pair

3005520	3008560	Um, right and then a tarot card. Oh
3009280	3011280	It's actually a toss up
3011600	3017520	If I could get a straight upgrade then we can definitely keep up. Oh, that was the wrong choice. I guess
3017920	3019520	I
3019520	3021920	That was a wrong choice because we could have got a bit of a
3023840	3028480	Thing going I'm gonna 25 dollars. Oh, I want to get that though
3030160	3039360	We'll go for the next right so king jack 10 nine eight seven six five. Oh, that's

3092480	3096560	A full house is I mean sure and doesn't make a difference
3097200	3099600	It doesn't make a difference right next round. Let's go
3100240	3106160	We're gonna skip because we want the negative joker. What are you play only one hand? Thank goodness

3692320	3694320	Kind of want to leave you in
3694720	3696720	10 9 8 7
3698720	3700720	Yeah, we do not have much going for us
3701600	3703600	Okay, so get rid of you
3706480	3709200	We want to keep oh my god, this isn't easy
3710880	3714160	I don't I know that silly ace king queen jack 10
3716080	3719040	I know that'll create a pot a planet, but
3721680	3724960	I mean we can kind of waste a little bit
3725920	3729360	Okay, hold on right ace king queens get
3731680	3733680	To 10 to 8
3733680	3738560	And we get a planet. Okay. That actually worked in our favor somehow streamer luck. Well, I know
3739280	3744000	I just got here and this stuff is always create literally absolutely crazy right now
3744800	3747200	So for those of you who are kindly joining us
3747760	3749920	Um, we have retrigger all
3750960	3757360	Face cards, which means the higher cards and our deck has got like 5 5 6 5 and for the face cards
3758000	3760000	We have a negative
3760720	3766000	Which is a cheeky spectral if I destroy the six which I've not been using at all. Um
3766880	3772320	Got the fortune teller so every time I use a turret, but then we have the shortcut on streets
3773280	3776640	We have the baseball for on commons, which we have two on common
3777280	3778960	a third on common
3778960	3786160	Then a multiplier if we do a straight and then a multiplier if the hand's already been done before so it's getting out of hand
3786240	3788240	But in a good way
3789200	3793360	You could just skip the jack and done ace queen 10 8 so
3797120	3803280	Again, we got Saturn. So we're gonna just straight up level up. I have absolutely no problems. Uh, maybe Saturn again
3804480	3806480	It was close
3807040	3813120	It was between one or the other but it's fine. It's fine. And then again, we're gonna add a high card in
3813360	3815360	Um
3819440	3823920	I think 10 is just an assured way to win at this point
3825120	3826640	reroll
3826640	3828640	devil, yep
3829280	3832960	Come the Joker gains a mall. I mean, I'm not gonna buy it pair
3833520	3837440	Conceived hand played without scoring the high cards interesting
3838000	3840000	So you want to oh absolutely
3840080	3842080	Absolutely
3844000	3849600	Played face cards have a chance to give mere money right what way up against hold on blind
3850320	3851280	Nope
3851280	3853280	and nope
3853280	3856480	The fish cards drawn face down
3858480	3864400	Something tells me we're gonna be okay against the fish. Okay. I don't know. I just have
3865120	3870400	Uh, three bucks of the heart the card is held. Okay. So what jack 10 98 7
3871040	3874240	Okay, so we'll just shove the five devil
3875760	3877200	one two
3877200	3878960	three four and five
3878960	3881920	Yeah, something tells me we're not going to be struggling through this gameplay
3882800	3884800	2.5 is still your highest combo though
3885440	3887440	Yeah, I was a little lipped with it
3889120	3891120	We get so much money as well
3891120	3898720	Two bucks for four hands remaining two bucks for four discards at four bucks. Sorry money and stuff one consumable slot and you come
3899920	3901920	and you come

3906480	3910560	Free money. Thank you and we get a little level up on that
3911360	3916000	Again with the playing cards. It really does not want to give me tarot cards. Does it?
3916560	3918560	Give me the king give me has
3919520	3921520	We'll just pick the
3922560	3925680	That's fine. We're just literally we're gonna max out on high
3927040	3931120	What do you do earn four dollars if the poker hand has a straight?
3931680	3938800	Yeah, you can you get negative poker cards in the shop or is the rarity of it insane because I don't think I've ever
3939680	3940960	done it
3940960	3945440	Rerolls the blind forces one card to always be selected
3948960	3950960	I mean
3951520	3953760	With our skip is that really that bad?
3956160	3959120	All right, I'll buy you so we can use you four of the canes
3962560	3964400	Free money
3964400	3966400	It won't always be a straight
3966560	3971440	Chances non zero. There's a voucher. You can get random negatives, but it's so rare
3972800	3975920	I'd be oh wait, I can't okay use please. Thank you
3975920	3977920	Yeah
3978160	3980560	Uh sure by that and we'll use that
3981680	3988320	Uh the point in rerolling at the moment because our hand is full and we need access to our deck
3989920	3991920	Oh, yes
3992560	3994560	Okay, so strength maker to
3995840	3997840	Uh 10 I guess
3998640	4000640	We've got seven coins
4001040	4004960	An ace. Oh, you know what make it an ace. Why not boom boom boom boom

4013520	4015520	Huh, what did I just do?
4017520	4019520	That was oh
4020560	4028720	Okay, it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's fine seven six five three two
4029280	4030960	brav

4038640	4041760	I got confuzzled. Okay. I thought it was the thing
4043200	4045200	Like the oh
4046560	4051680	Yes for how many steel interesting. I don't have I don't have it, but it's fine
4053520	4059040	Oh, we just need a few more saturns to make up for that. That was my bad. That was my it's fine. She's winning too hard
4059040	4062560	I don't need to think exactly. I don't need to think we're just
4063200	4066240	Steam rolling up. I guess I mean, I guess
4067200	4069680	Though I really want a six. Oh, there's only two
4074640	4076640	Do I really want
4076640	4081040	No, I don't I'm oh wait. I could have used that gray card. Oh
4083040	4088400	Well, I did it now. All right, let's see if we can get a cheeky negative because why not
4090000	4097360	One discard each round. Come on. Give us a negative. You know, you want to re-rolls boss blind and initial card
4097600	4099600	Nah, give us a

4221120	4223120	worth simsing

4239280	4241280	direct support
4242320	4244320	Retriggers all cards. No
4244800	4246800	Yeah, let's go
4247280	4252240	Right, why are you forcing me to play a king a queen a jack a ten?
4254000	4257440	No, that's up here. Shout out to all my players right so
4258880	4260880	Back and still throw away for
4265680	4267680	I know it. I know it seems crazy
4268800	4270800	Wait
4274240	4276240	That changes every hand
4277440	4279440	That's so dangerous
4280800	4284320	Oh because it's selected it would get thrown away dafty
4285040	4290640	Oh, we won on the deck. We did it first freaking try good thing. I didn't bet against you damn straight
4291920	4293680	Little thing you
4293760	4298800	I am so dumb. Of course. It would throw away the selected card. I was like, I'm going to play around this
4299280	4301280	We are very lucky. We actually
4301840	4305360	Did that whole ole money. All right. I'm not going to do endless modes
4306080	4308480	Have at least two polychrome jokers
4309200	4313040	Two plus multi for every five dollars you have
4314480	4320000	Okay, curious little hydration check start run with no face cards and you're
4320880	4324880	No face cards
4326400	4330880	Right, we've got a seal for red blue yellow green. We don't
4331600	4334960	One plus joker slot, but one less hand
4337440	4341600	Hmm one less hand so three hands total
4344400	4346640	Hmm curious
4347040	4355600	I've already forgotten what one less hand but one more joker slot. Okay. Well, we've got six five
4356400	4358400	We've got dupla vase
4362720	4368880	I mean we'll play the doubles two pair. Why not? Well, that really wasn't that much points if I'm going to be honest
4369040	4371280	Uh, I thought that was going to be a little bit more
4372000	4376800	Uh, we do have a suit in the distance
4378160	4380160	I might regret this but
4380320	4382320	Okay, we got the suit
4382400	4384400	We got the flush. Yeah
4385920	4391920	Okay, there we go. We made it. We made it. It's fine. It's fine. Right. We're back to normal economy. So
4393760	4396800	Not the game already pushing us to try and
4396960	4402000	Um do two pairs. No, we don't have anything that shapes the deck. Yeah
4404720	4407360	Our economy's rubbish, are we gonna win the
4408560	4412000	If I fail the hook discard two random cards each time please
4413120	4415600	I actually think we need to invest, you know that
4417040	4419280	Wait the hiker. Yeah, okay, okay
4421200	4425760	Uh, sure and we'll level up two pair because I'm a little bit nervous about this last one
4426560	4428560	Oh wait
4430640	4436560	I didn't realize we were or we weren't at the boss fight yet. Hold on. I shouldn't have done that but we did it anyway, so
4437760	4443600	Let's do ranks. We already have two doubles and we did just level up pairs. So shout out to all my pairs
4443680	4446880	We're gonna throw away that five so it's no longer in our inventory
4447760	4452320	Um, and then we are going to repeat and do the exact same thing
4452960	4455760	Two doubles throw away the five and there
4456400	4461280	We almost had it. Sorry my impression was again two doubles
4461840	4463840	And so just throw away one
4465600	4466800	Uh
4466800	4468800	There we go
4469360	4472160	I wouldn't say easy that was our last hand
4478560	4480800	A bit of a rough start I have to admit
4482720	4484720	I mean we can use a tarot
4486800	4489200	Or we could do three of a kind. Um
4490640	4492640	Early hiker is pretty good
4493760	4495760	We don't have anything that shapes us
4497520	4502560	I kind of want to get economy going. Fuck it. We need we need a gamble. We need gamble. I need economy
4503600	4507280	discard two random cards pair hand played well
4508240	4514480	Well, let's do that and see oh, of course the ace goes flying into space. Um
4517040	4519280	We're getting incredibly lucky with the
4520800	4528640	The cards though. I think if you go for flushes straight house, you'll win this boss fight. Hmm. Okay. We'll one it thankfully but
4529360	4534960	I need to retrain my brain because it wants to oh my god
4535760	4537760	Did you hear my stomach?
4539120	4543120	That's not gonna be enough is it no it doesn't look like that
4544640	4549840	I mean it would be kind of oh no, we only have one hand left whole holy moley. I was about to throw there
4552560	4554560	Um
4557120	4559120	Okay, get rid of these
4560880	4564160	Okay, that's fine. That's fine. We're safe. We're safe. Relax
4565440	4567920	No flake. It's called being bad at about true
4569120	4572880	Okay, that's fine. We didn't get any interest but we will next round
4573920	4575920	so
4578720	4582720	That's just awful by all the kids. Oh, did we do it?
4585680	4590560	We could shape our deck right now. What's the what the beans can I get a base?
4591280	4594800	Next base addition Joker is free and a foil
4597520	4599520	Hmm
4600000	4604960	Minus one hand size. Hmm. I do not have much faith for this
4607440	4609920	I think we're gonna have to shape the deck right now
4611760	4614480	Earn five bucks for each discarded ace
4614800	4619520	A first discard of round has only one card
4620240	4622240	Oh for goodness sake
4623600	4625600	That's not shaping the deck at all
4626320	4628320	for you
4628560	4632320	First played face cards give times to it
4634320	4636320	Please don't help me
4636320	4640720	Earn an extra dollar of interest for every five bucks you have at the end of the round
4641440	4648480	Right, I don't think we're gonna win and for that reason alone. I'm going to discover that card
4650960	4654320	I know it's going to be frustrating being like you're literally thrown because you're not
4654640	4658320	I think we're already to pass the point of winning
4659280	4661920	We'll do a free Joker in the next shop, but
4663760	4668240	I for each earned five bucks for discarding an ace
4668800	4671920	Five four three two nothing
4675120	4680000	The black deck is the hardest to play. Yeah, and I'm needing something to
4689680	4691680	Yeah
4692400	4694400	I
4695920	4700240	Right what I need a 10 under queen
4703440	4705760	Close but no cigar a 10
4708160	4710160	Okay
4710640	4712640	10
4713600	4715600	Okay, well
4717200	4719200	Well
4719280	4723440	That's why I bought that because I didn't think we'd be lucky and yeah, no no got it
4726400	4730800	Literally what can I do a true purple that's a three of a kind
4732560	4739280	Can't do nothing else, right? Okay. Let's try that again. Let's try that again. We unfortunately didn't get anything that was kind of complimentary
4740400	4744000	So again one post joker slot, but minus a tiki hand
4745120	4747840	That was rough right. What are you uncommon Joker?
4750080	4752080	I
4752480	4756400	Skip that for the rare because you can't do two in a row for some reason
4758240	4760240	Let's go for double vase
4760880	4764880	Shoot easy easy to win off the bat for these ones. Um
4766000	4768000	10 98
4768000	4770000	Gonna work um
4773040	4775040	Gee imagine if you gave me
4775680	4778960	Oh, wait, you know what? Let's just play the doubles and get rid of that
4783200	4786400	God this this game does not like me
4788880	4794880	Wait, okay, we'll just do a full house. That's fine. That's fine. It's fine. We can do a full house. See it's fine relax
4796080	4800000	Okay, what are we looking at? What are we looking at?
4800000	4802000	And
4803520	4805520	Well, we can't buy anything
4808720	4810720	I think we're gonna have to just go in
4812320	4817200	And try and do something like that could be better. I'm gonna be honest that could be better
4821840	4823840	I think we'll invest in
4824800	4826800	Oh
4827040	4830160	Why are these so sucky and not the good kind?
4831120	4833120	Okay, we're gonna skip the rare
4833840	4840240	Sorry, we're gonna skip the blind in order to do get a free Joker because we need jokers to instantly
4842240	4844240	Shoot maybe
4846000	4853200	We need jokers to help us out played cards with spades to give plus three wins scored spade
4854080	4857600	I don't even have one spade on hand. So that's not happening
4858720	4860880	Unless I'm just throwing everything in the bin
4864880	4874240	I mean, I could sorry the smart stomach internally farting if I came up in my um, I could go for a flush on
4875440	4877440	heart
4877760	4882320	This is my first stream. Wow. Hello. Thank you for the tip. I appreciate it
4883280	4889200	Your first stream and it's me being rubbish on freaking Baltral shaking my head my head
4890000	4895440	Or did you come in right at the start where I showed the pregnancy artwork? Hmm. Hmm
4896160	4898160	Be honest. So when was it?
4899040	4901040	I don't know what to do
4902080	4904240	I could go for a flush with hearts
4907520	4910800	Okay, that actually kind of worked out somehow
4913120	4916880	And that got me 200 for that play which is all I need
4922320	4924320	This is
4925520	4932820	Not good not not good at all. I think I might have to discard for a flush of spades
4943280	4945280	Oh
4949680	4951680	My god
4953840	4958000	I think we're better going for diamonds. Oh, no, they've only got six diamonds
4958640	4963120	So the odds of pulling us. Okay. Sorry. I'm so sorry. This is gonna look painful, but
4964720	4966720	Yeah, okay, that's what I wanted
4973280	4975280	Okay
4978720	4984560	That paid off somehow that paid off and we get a free joker out of the shop. What is it?
4985680	4987680	I'm
4988320	4990320	I don't have anything
4990960	4992960	Oh, this is cursed
4994800	4996800	This is cursed so much
4996880	4998880	I
5000560	5002880	Have nothing shaping this again
5005440	5010800	Add one voucher three hand size base chips and mullies or have
5012800	5014800	Brothers is too hard
5015920	5017920	And not the good game
5019360	5021360	I have nothing
5021600	5023600	Oh
5026480	5029280	There's no point in spending any money I have no direction
5031200	5033200	I have no direction in my game
5033760	5034480	There's
5034480	5038400	Oh, I don't I don't believe maybe we'll try a different pack next round
5039120	5042640	Because uh, I do not think we've got this
5044400	5047520	What's this ace ken queen jack right so give me a ten
5048480	5050480	So go
5052960	5054960	Give me a ten
5056560	5059760	You know your funny game, I don't like you
5062400	5070400	I don't think we've won this I think we'll try a different deck because holy moly is this deck freaking hard like not the good kind
5070960	5078640	Why we we might just have to fucking put everything into space honestly
5085600	5087600	Doubles I mean
5093280	5095280	Should we just
5096000	5100400	Right I've never used this before the credit card, but
5102480	5106880	I think we're just gonna have to go all in or else like we just straight up can't win
5109280	5114960	To convert the left death select two cards converts the left into the right. So this is the one we do want
5116000	5118160	So take the two make it a queen
5118880	5124640	Oh, but then there's what I don't even want to use the wheel of fortune ain't gonna get scone for me
5125680	5128160	We're just gonna go in today. I'm sorry
5129120	5131120	Hi, thank you for joining
5132000	5133680	um
5133680	5135680	Hearts not
5136080	5144000	The only thing is spades. We're even interested in multi cards. Yeah, we're just use mullies on the highs
5145040	5147040	This is rough
5147840	5151680	We can go into debt but over a card slot. I don't think so
5154000	5156160	I don't think so base chips
5160160	5166640	I don't know if I'm making any of the right decisions, but this is like this is terrible
5166960	5168960	Oh
5171760	5176080	Absolutely terrible. No, what are you uncommon? Okay, so that's good
5178480	5180480	98
5181200	5184960	987 no, we can't do nothing there. All right, let's get rid of the wee ones
5187520	5190480	I know we need a 10 and and obviously it's not gonna give me one
5190720	5200720	We got a McMansion only to lose it in the next round literally that game was so good clubs flush. Oh
5202240	5207200	Okay, you are absolutely correct. How did you even see that?
5208880	5210400	Play
5210400	5214480	Oh wait, is this spades? Oh, it's spades. Oops. It's the other one I need
5217120	5219120	Are you kidding me
5220560	5222560	This
5227120	5231680	Game is such a troll one minute. It's like, yeah, don't worry. I got you
5231680	5235680	I'll get you addicted real quick baby cakes and then the next minute. It's like now you're on your own
5236960	5239120	The whip flash I get from playing this game
5240960	5244960	Okay, that this guy is saving us right now
5245360	5247360	I
5249280	5253040	Would absolutely adore an extra hand size. Thank you
5254160	5256160	Okay, a minus four. That's fine
5256480	5260160	One discard each round two plus hand size
5261600	5264160	But an uh hand size down
5267200	5270720	I need something anything to shape this run
5271280	5273280	No
5274800	5279760	Spades and clubs are confusing. I'm too small brain honestly get the plus two joker
5282240	5284240	Like
5285040	5287040	Like I might as well just go all out
5288160	5293920	I'm gonna pop. Why is this game so hard this game would I'm just I'm going full debt
5294720	5301840	Mummies losing the house mum mummies failing her mortgage payments. That's it. I owe so much ASMR right now
5306960	5313360	Wa wa wa diamonds hearts clubs spades wait, what what we're picking
5315920	5319200	Two times multi two and four chance to get destroyed though
5319440	5323760	I feel like you're just gonna get destroyed instantly 50 chance of it popping away
5325680	5332320	Card can be used in any suit. I feel like maybe just I feel like we have to go spades. I know it sounds silly, but
5334560	5339120	I don't want to be homeless. I mean, are you technically homeless if you can
5340960	5343680	That's it. Are you technically
5344240	5346240	Oh
5346560	5352400	Next base edition shop joker is a free and holographic. Well, we're gonna have to go for it
5354160	5356160	Not that one though
5357200	5359200	Um
5360560	5364160	You can't be homeless if you can technically
5365840	5372560	Get inside somewhere and have a home there wink wink right discard all that
5374080	5376080	Okay, I gave me a space
5379120	5382640	This is the this I think we're gonna have to go suits
5384480	5387920	A flush sorry my pardon me. I think we're gonna have to go with flush
5388800	5395120	What are you you're free for each joker card? Absolutely. What take out take away a discard I guess
5396320	5398320	Yeah, and then in you come
5400480	5402400	And then
5403360	5407840	Yep, I will go into debt for spades because we want all the spades
5408720	5412080	And then I can't go into any further debt. That's fine
5413520	5415520	Okay
5415840	5417840	Spades or play only
5418720	5422640	Oh, well, it's over now in that suits spades and then
5423280	5426400	Do the rank and then turn all you guys into spades
5427200	5435440	Okay, and then do a suit again and then ace did it since we can only play one round. Good luck
5441680	5446640	Okay, well we have her we have our bearings
5448560	5450560	Which is we want things to be a
5452640	5454640	Flush
5457200	5464400	And do we upgrade flush via celestial hat flush flush flush flush flush dripper
5466800	5468800	We are in so much debt
5474080	5476080	Choose two four jokers
5476640	5478640	Would it all spade cut?
5479360	5481360	Yeah
5482320	5484320	Are you serious?
5484640	5486640	Are you serious?
5486640	5492080	All spade cards are debuff. Meanwhile, this is the only thing keeping us alive right now
5492960	5494960	The curse of the credit card
5495520	5499440	Shawnee owns the debt collectors. Oh gee. Honestly
5502080	5505440	Now sell the credit card I lose the game if I sell it
5506960	5508960	Because I'm like in so much debt
5509600	5514880	That's how they get you this we are literally learning an economy 101 right now
5515680	5517680	This is how they get you
5519440	5521440	Should I do the buffoon
5522080	5524720	You know what wait? No, you're on common, but you're common
5524720	5528240	So maybe I can pick up an uncommon and then he can come in to play
5530240	5532240	I'll put you to the end
5534240	5537440	You know what let's let's get silly with it
5538400	5540880	Let's get silly with uh, there's only one uncommon
5542800	5544800	Uh, well this was
5545520	5547520	Absolutely useless right if I sell you
5548560	5550240	Then add you
5550240	5552560	Because you're on common so you're gonna compliment him
5553680	5557920	Gain chips if the hand contains a straight right. We need a bigger hand size
5558400	5562000	Oops all sixes doubles all listed probabilities. I don't
5567840	5569840	Know
5572720	5574720	We what
5579280	5581280	Wait, did I kill us with debt?
5585040	5590240	Oh my god, wait, I don't have my glasses on that that's definitely a minus sign
5593040	5596160	Uh, my bad. I'm a I'm gonna just sell that
5596720	5598720	Uh
5599120	5604960	Yeah, let me let me just sell that my bad. Uh, wasn't who wasn't my intended purpose
5605760	5608720	Uh, we'll just do the straight then eat
5610080	5612080	I didn't even know the game worked like that
5613040	5619440	Well, I think we're gonna have to skip as well because our freaking only card is deep off
5620240	5626960	How much does one regular flush get us
5631840	5633840	Wow
5634400	5636400	We may make it
5640960	5642960	We may make it in in the end
5646960	5648960	I
5648960	5650960	So what happens now?
5653920	5655920	Okay
5661120	5665360	The one thing we put right new run we need a different card. That's so hard
5668480	5670400	That's so hard
5670400	5675680	Mommy, there's only so much debt a reef Lincoln handle. Literally. Sorry. I completely screwed that run over
5675840	5681280	Uh, I was getting a bit confused. Okay. I was getting confuzzled. Am I not allowed to be confuzzled?
5681680	5683680	Rude honestly
5683920	5684880	Right
5684880	5688800	Spatial cards may appear in the shop start with a hex
5697360	5699360	Is that even bad
5702320	5704320	Destroy all their jokers
5706640	5708640	Okay
5709120	5710880	But we don't even
5710880	5713360	Wait, so if we have two jokers, I'd pull
5715520	5720720	If we have two jokers 50% one is destroyed 50% the other is
5722160	5724160	Receives a buff, okay
5728080	5734160	The run went from mummy please to mother the debt literally absolutely twat that
5736160	5739360	Uh, just go for double base and we're there
5740800	5742800	Okay
5742880	5746000	Can't believe it. I'm actually gonna have to play the economy in this game. Uh
5749440	5755040	You need but really they go for a bit fun pack and try and shape it off the bat
5759120	5762640	Against my better judgment adds the number of poker
5763440	5766560	Times the poker hand has been played this run to the molly
5768960	5770960	This joker gains
5771040	5773440	multiplier for each card sold
5774080	5776640	Resets when the boss is no that's rubbish
5777520	5779520	Sure come aboard you
5780640	5787360	And then do that and then it's a 50 50 right, okay, we now have a 1.5
5787920	5796560	As the number of times the poker hand has been played this run to the multiplier, okay, so we just keep going
5802560	5805680	I don't think I'm understanding this properly um
5806960	5808960	We do have a duple of aim
5809600	5811600	I do we just get rid of all the low
5813040	5816320	Now the more you play the same hand the stronger it gets
5817360	5819360	Oh, no
5820080	5822080	Well, there's another full house. Why not?
5826880	5829760	So I want to do full house now
5832480	5834720	Uh tarot another joker
5837920	5843600	Hopefully we can get a negative joker the next all spade cards are debuff. That's fine. Um
5844320	5850240	Mummy disassociating in the club playing purely off of vibes. Honestly. I'm getting lost in this loss
5851520	5854240	Right, that's fine. Clubs are debuffed. That's fine
5858960	5862960	Right if they're debuffed, I don't even want them in my hand to be honest
5865120	5868240	I'm sure I'm probably making like some should I just go for a flush
5871040	5872800	Clearly not
5872880	5876080	What's this then? I have a duple of e
5878160	5880160	To appears how much is that gonna get me
5881600	5887840	No, oh, yeah, that's not even that bad. I don't know how you work, but you're honestly helping. Um
5890960	5895680	Ten nine eight seven six. I got rid of roots of sixes
5898720	5901920	Oh wait idiot jack ten nine eight seven
5902880	5908720	He he he sorry. Sorry. I raised your blood pressure. They're almost hitting send. I'm sorry. I know what did
5909920	5913280	I almost did it. Okay. We've got one dollar interest. That's what I like to see
5914400	5916400	Raises the cap on interest
5919200	5921200	I wouldn't mind that
5921200	5926800	Initial booster packs are free and I can pick two joe. I might do double skip. You know that
5927760	5929760	No, I can't
5930720	5932720	Hmm
5933360	5939280	What is it booster packs are free initial cards and booster packs? Okay, that might be worth it
5939280	5942960	Oh, my mouse is uh, please don't die mid game. That would be great. Mr. Mouse
5945360	5947600	I think we're gonna go and get more money
5952000	5954000	Uh, we'll do that
5954960	5959840	I know I should probably invest in two pairs something but
5960640	5964080	I didn't trust it right. We're gonna get free stuff from the shop and then we're gonna play
5966240	5968240	Oh
5968240	5970240	A cheeky double. Is that the best I got?
5971520	5973520	What does one hand do?
5975840	5977840	A full house, please work
5977920	5985360	Okay, that was lucky right what is free in the shop, please help us
5986240	5988240	Please I beg
5988640	5993760	Well, it's free. So go for it. Wait bye. Oh, I mean, I guess bye
5997280	6000000	We does the card or a planet card
6000480	6002480	So
6008800	6011600	I don't even oh this run isn't
6012720	6014720	See when you cannae
6014960	6017440	When you cannae shape the run right at the start
6019200	6022240	It becomes like a shot in the dark it really does
6024320	6029840	I think maybe three of a kind I seem to be or maybe two pairs. They see the most common
6030960	6036720	Well, you can just you just gotta start picking but that's pressure and stuff
6037600	6039600	Right must play five cards. That's fine
6041360	6045840	Uh, right, we just did get doubles. So let's do that play hand
6046960	6048960	Is that yet? No
6049520	6054640	Okay, that's not that bad. That's not that bad really. It's we're doing fine for now. We're doing fine
6054800	6059920	I need to well destroy lower number cards. Yeah
6061840	6063840	We got nine our economy's getting there
6066800	6068960	That's pretty good have to admit
6071440	6075920	These however are the worst why can't I use it?
6078240	6081200	Do you need to have a second joker to use it the egg
6081680	6084720	Gains three bucks of sell value at end of round
6088640	6093200	What it just keeps going up and up and up or is there like a ceiling
6095520	6101440	Is this like playing the stonks market invest in stonks now and then later it's better
6102160	6106880	It goes up. Okay. I'll get I've never I've not grabbed it before so I'm glad I can unlock it
6108240	6110240	It right
6111200	6117040	Fuck it. No, wait. No, no, wait. No, I should hold on to it
6120720	6124640	Oh, no, wait, never I should hold on to it because it's a plus 10
6131280	6136320	Only I would manage that. What do you do spectrum? No, keep your eyes from both of them
6138160	6140560	But now it does something till you need to sell it
6141600	6147040	We can get better with the cash later. Honestly, how can I be messing this up so much, right?
6147040	6151200	Would it create the planet if there if it's held in the hand? That's fine
6153440	6155600	Oh, wait, I need to delete the smaller cards
6160720	6162720	I don't know
6165200	6167200	I just destroy the two
6168160	6170800	Which wasn't very nice, but I did what I had to do
6173520	6181200	You discard those okay, we can do a flush again a full house my apologies a full push
6184240	6186240	Well, there it is
6186960	6189200	I guess we're going for it with him
6189840	6193040	With a full house, which I don't normally go for but he will
6193760	6195760	Uh diamond cards
6196640	6199600	We might be doing it as if I can even get
6200400	6204720	Three three times multiplier if you have 16 enhanced card currently nothing
6205440	6209520	Yeah, no, uh, I'm not gonna be shocked that I I'm not going for that because jase
6211920	6220320	Plus three multiplier on a diamond how much do you sell for a whole six dollar beautiful stuff, right?
6220640	6222320	What are we looking at?
6222320	6225040	Rubbage, right just keep sending it
6225920	6227920	I think we're gonna have to go full house
6228320	6232080	Runs if we can even do it because we can't on the first one
6233440	6235440	And get rid of that play hand
6236080	6238080	How much?
6240320	6243440	We're making it by the skin of our teeth for now
6246880	6248880	For now we can do it
6251200	6254160	You leveled up again. Oh, he's nine dollars
6263200	6267920	Ah this nothing is being shaped right now nothing at all
6269600	6275680	I'm just going for it and our freaking egg is mocking us saying. Oh you want to sell me don't you?
6280640	6282640	Multi needs to be before
6284960	6286960	You go here
6291440	6294240	The daily card get me 2.5 million feels good man
6296000	6302160	Okay, supernova's at the end. Thank you one day. I'll remember fancy-looking cards to the right
6302960	6305120	Is to do that day? No, no it is not
6305840	6307840	um
6307920	6311200	And then is this the boss by one minus hand size
6312160	6314160	We're actually doing
6314320	6319440	Okay in quotation marks. So I I'm confident we at least have this round
6322240	6328560	Oh, it meant handers and cards in my deck. Uh, we might have to go for a suit
6338640	6340640	Oh
6344880	6347680	Thank goodness, thank goodness
6354000	6356000	Okay
6359360	6363520	I'd really rather like to keep that to have a hidden upgrade
6363760	6365760	Uh
6367920	6371280	But playing this is gonna do like next to nothing
6379040	6381680	If you draw 10 it's a straight flush
6383120	6389200	Wait, I have three hands. Hold on. I have two more. Sorry. That's for something again. Right. That's fine
6393520	6395520	I
6398400	6400400	Need a 10
6406080	6412240	I needed a 10 either way right what do two kings do I really want to keep this
6415920	6417360	Okay, okay
6417360	6424320	I literally I just I want to level up anything because I'm I'm scrambling right now trying to save this run
6425680	6430480	Ouija minus hand size. Absolutely not. I'm have I'm perishing
6431440	6434400	Converts all cards into a straight wait. I'm not doing
6436000	6438000	No, I need diamonds apparently
6440000	6445280	Bruh, this this is the worst run. I think we've ever had there's like no point in spending any money
6446000	6448000	Oh
6448320	6450320	You believe
6455440	6457440	I'm perishing
6460880	6464320	I'm perishing I've got a rank possibly
6464320	6466320	Okay
6473920	6476160	Oh my god my stomach's making me feel crazy. Bruh
6477840	6482320	Honestly, I did it. Streamer luck has to kick in at some point. I think I used it on the first run
6484160	6486160	This is like awful
6486960	6488960	Oh
6491840	6497360	Literally the the egg that is taunting us is keeping us alive. Oh my god. It's ready to help as well
6497360	6500800	Which I really don't want but hey, I mean we'll get a
6502560	6504720	A thing so
6504720	6509040	You know, I'll take you anything that levels up anything. I'll take it
6510720	6512720	Yep
6512720	6514720	I
6515680	6519840	Literally level up anything I am scrambling I'm scrambling
6521840	6524400	Sure, let's just keep leveling up to a pair
6525440	6527440	Scramble any harder
6527440	6529920	Call me eggs because I'm scrambling for anything, right?
6531120	6534720	Sure, we've got room for another Joker. Let's see if we can shape with four
6535760	6537280	awful
6537280	6539280	awful
6543440	6546720	Oh, I guess you
6554800	6558480	The egg is keeping us alive. I can't even get rid of the purr guy
6559920	6563200	Diamonds are helping loyalty card is helping
6565200	6567200	Poker splash
6568160	6570160	You had a straight but you tossed it
6572080	6577440	I don't think I've had enough sleep. I slept all day after stream yesterday and I still don't think I had enough sleep
6580720	6585920	Airing an extra dollar of interest I wish I could sell
6588800	6595040	This is gonna come in clutch whenever we're absolutely panicking I don't think I'm gonna have to skip these are rubbish
6597920	6599920	I
6601600	6604480	I'm not gonna make it not gonna make it
6607120	6609120	I do not believe
6612960	6617840	I do not believe I haven't slept a single segment straight into work after stream. I'll let you zombie
6619760	6623280	I had enough sleep, but it wasn't enough. Are you me? I am
6624000	6626000	Um
6626400	6628400	How do you guys see that so easily?
6629760	6633200	I'm destroyed from all the crying. I am I'm actually distraught
6634560	6636560	I
6637440	6640000	For anyone who didn't see yesterday's stream
6640240	6644080	I've got John Wick spoilers if you don't want to listen for like the next three minutes
6644320	6647440	If you just want to close your ear. Oh my god. I can't even open up my bottle of water
6648000	6654320	Oh, oh, did you hear my wrist crack trying to open this bottle of water? Geez, what did they make the freaking cap out of titanium steel?
6657920	6659920	Outrageous, um
6660960	6662400	Did you hear it?
6662400	6668480	Ew, that's so gross. My wrists are really I have it incredibly. I thought that was the bottle cap
6669200	6669920	Fine
6669920	6676320	Um, I have really weak wrists and hands for some reason like all my strength is in my thighs and my
6676480	6681280	My gluteus maximus. That's where all the strength in my body lies. I have no other strength
6681280	6685440	I have no strength in my back. I have no strength in my hands my arms my wrists anything like that
6685920	6693360	Um, it's just all all even my even my toes are stronger because I can grip things with it
6694000	6696800	Like I have absolutely nothing else going for me
6698400	6699920	Um
6699920	6701920	Right jack 10 987
6702800	6707920	Wait, we only got 1.8. When do you pot? Oh, you don't pot
6712000	6714000	Oh no
6715680	6719600	Oh no, right, we've got a full house which is leveled up
6722880	6726640	We're gonna be okay. I think oh no, we did it. We did it
6727600	6734320	How much are you $18 or beloved egg is $18 now three of a kind
6741840	6747360	I don't have anything strong it opens jars with their thighs. Oh, no, you have to tap it on the bunker
6748480	6752240	um, if you tap the jar lid on the bunker it like
6753440	6755440	Weakens it and then you can open up
6756320	6757840	um
6757840	6764720	Crumbling to dust before our eyes not quite not quite but like literally I can't handle it
6765360	6768800	Oh, wait, sorry a countertop. It's bunker in scotland
6768960	6773920	But uh the kitchen countertop is what you call it smile
6774720	6777120	We call it a bunker. I I know I know
6777840	6781440	Why why Scottish people? Why do you call it a bunker? I don't know
6782080	6788960	It's just how it is. It's called a bunker the the kitchen countertop the worktop the whatever the bench the kitchen bench
6789040	6791040	maybe you call it
6791120	6793120	I want to pass on by strong his thighs
6794080	6798880	50 that convention. I'll make all my travels expenses back. I'll have a little sign
6799360	6801360	50 cents to be stepped on
6801600	6805840	A dollar to be a thigh crushed until you pass it. That's terrible
6806800	6810800	I mean, honestly, it would be a way to get your money back, right? I am fully
6811120	6813520	I have fully accepted this run isn't happening
6824080	6826080	I'm gonna start beatboxing to cool
6829920	6834880	Oh my god, you can squeeze the lid with the palm of your hand. I don't have any grip strength either
6837520	6839520	Could you could you imagine
6841040	6845840	Imagine no grip strength. You know when people always make fun of folk for having a weak handshake
6846960	6848960	Imagine the weaker grip
6850480	6855520	I mean I could I could probably grip it like a vice if I wanted to but my like it hurts
6855600	6861680	It hurts everything although my gran had absolutely terrible arthritis in her hands
6862400	6866080	And unfortunately, I'm gonna teach you a fun fact about biology
6866880	6868880	If you are a chick
6869760	6879280	Wait, whatever your dad's gran has in ailments, you are almost like 100 likely to get it
6880160	6882560	However, your mom's gran
6883280	6887360	ailments aren't necessarily always going to be passed on to you
6888000	6893120	But if it's your dad's mom or your dad your gran on your dad's side
6893360	6896800	Then you're very likely to catch those ailments if you're born a chick
6897040	6901920	That only applies to chick. Is this a scientific fact? Yes, because
6902640	6908960	Uh, oh my god. Sorry. I love I'm prompted biology lesson. Let's go. Um, so if you didn't know the male
6909680	6914480	The sperm determines the sex of the child of the fetus
6915040	6918960	Um, and because of that the male can only pass on a fully
6920080	6922320	Full so it's x and y chromosome, right?
6922720	6929600	So the dad passes on an x or a y a y is a hundred percent him an x is a hundred percent his mom
6929680	6934800	He has no female x inside him if that makes sense. So it's a hundred percent your gran
6935120	6939680	It sounds really bizarre, but basically I'm like a hundred percent of my I
6940400	6943120	It's a weird mix. It's really cool though. I absolutely
6943760	6949600	Absolutely love biology when it comes to that your mom is always an x your mom will always give you an x
6949680	6954240	So like the reason why men have nipples is to pass down genetic information
6954640	6958800	For breastfeeding. That's why some men actually end up having like breast tissue
6958800	6964320	It's completely natural completely normal men are a hundred percent susceptible to breast cancer as well
6964320	6970240	Please do not think you are immune if you ever find a lump or anything. Do not be embarrassed
6970400	6975840	I assure you you are not the only man on earth that may ever have a lump in their breast. This is
6976240	6979680	It is perfectly natural. It is perfectly normal. Do not be embarrassed
6979760	6981120	I cannot
6981120	6987680	Emphasize how much any healthcare worker has seen everything at the point at the point you present your symptoms
6988000	6990960	The healthcare worker has seen everything
6991760	6992880	Okay
6992880	6996720	No, your genetic can be really messed up. You can have like disorders and all that
6998560	6999680	Um
6999680	7001680	I have tds to potentially have dark
7001680	7006560	Yes, you need to pass on the genetic mammary gland information because mammals are
7007200	7009920	Um milk producing so some
7010560	7015200	Animals take a chicken for example a little chicken gets all its nutrients from the egg
7015200	7020320	It's all it'll need. It does not need a milk supply. It uses a yolk sac for example to grow
7020800	7024080	Um, whereas mammals are term
7024960	7028080	Usually are born a much younger much
7028880	7036240	Unable to do things especially humans are a fantastic example of mammals being unable to do anything for a very long time
7036240	7040800	But the reason for that is because the circumference of the head of the baby
7041440	7046400	Um babies need to be born essentially before full gestation
7046960	7052160	Because it would um perish the mother so humans evolved to
7052720	7055760	Give birth around the nine month mark. But actually
7056640	7062000	Fun factoid the embryo normally is 10 months old by the time it comes out
7062320	7065920	Yes, the brain still needs to develop a massive example of
7066400	7069360	Um, the development stage is called ossification
7070080	7076080	Um children are born with a lot more bones than adults end up with and um
7076720	7079440	ossification is the process of your
7080240	7083920	Bones um coming together a fusing together
7084000	7088240	Which is why babies cannot crawl until usually the six month mark
7088320	7094240	But uh milestones and children aren't necessarily an indication of good health bad health
7094560	7096960	Everyone is different. That is why um
7097840	7105520	A lot of mothers in healthcare are ossification no ossification like oseph something like that
7105600	7107600	I can't spell the rest of it
7108560	7110000	But
7110000	7111200	Yeah, like um
7111200	7116080	That's why like you might have a story saying like I completely skip the crawl phase
7116160	7119600	Some children completely skip the crawl phase. They don't even need to do it
7120000	7123040	Um, they have no desire to do it and then they'll just up and walk
7123280	7128800	Um after a certain amount of months has formed. It's fantastic. Honestly, it's quite fascinating
7129200	7134320	Um to think like I'm sure you guys might have funny stories that your mom was all freaked out being like
7134400	7142320	Ah my poor baby boy wasn't doing this and that and it's like no, it's fine. Don't be silly the only cause for concern
7142800	7144800	um
7144800	7148080	Really is a child that cannot latch
7148800	7151120	It's probably the massive are you joking?
7152960	7154800	Um
7154800	7156800	I need a queen now
7157520	7159520	I was gonna go for a flush
7159600	7161600	Um
7162880	7169920	I was a quick talker not a quick walker. Yes, absolutely fun fact skipping the crawl phase is a major sign of dyspraxia
7171200	7173840	Condition is hard baby. Literally those can't control forelimbs at once. Yes
7173840	7178160	That's why you had to do tummy time as well to help raise your neck muscles
7178560	7183280	Because babies pretty much have knee neck muscles to save their the life of them
7183440	7187760	They like violently swing their head around just like so crazy
7188480	7191200	Um, oh what am I gonna try and achieve here?
7192560	7197360	I was gonna go for a flush with hearts, but I only have two discards left
7198160	7200720	And I've got a bit of a high thing going on here
7202720	7206960	I was cartwheeling out of the wind feels good man. Honestly come flying out
7208880	7213360	Well, I actually got four of a kind which is so rare
7213520	7218960	Sorry, I got so distracted I stopped playing the game. Um
7221680	7223680	Hmm
7230400	7233840	Hmm, have I just shot myself in the foot doing such a pit manoeuvre
7238640	7240640	I think we're gonna have to get rid of them
7241120	7243200	Yeah, I'm gonna say try and go for doubles like this
7244720	7247680	Hmm, I don't lose honestly
7249200	7253920	Uh, this is definitely not oh, of course, he's ready to pop now when I didn't need him
7255120	7257120	No, these are rubbish. I mean
7257520	7260480	At least we win but I didn't he need
7261920	7263920	Oh
7264560	7269760	Well, I guess pop on the jack then I didn't even realize we were up against that thing
7270320	7276640	But that's funny. Okay. We did it. We did it somehow. We did it a christmas freaking miracle 11 dollar. He does
7281280	7283280	Will we go out for two pairs
7289920	7293840	I think we're gonna shape our deck with two pairs shout out to all my pairs
7295360	7297680	You're the only thing keeping us alive right now
7300720	7303440	So does splash not complement two pairs
7306000	7307600	I don't oh I do not
7311200	7314240	Does splash not complement two pairs? I don't know. I don't know
7317520	7319520	We're gonna have to shape it now
7319840	7321840	We don't have a choice
7321840	7323840	Splash works for extra two cards
7324000	7329440	Then what get rid of loyalty card? No, not really splash is good if you have a lot of junk cards
7329760	7331760	Mmm
7335840	7342080	All right, we're shape we're gonna have to shape it now or we are basically accept and defeat
7342560	7344560	So you'll have to forgive me
7346480	7350320	I'm going to do something very painful and you're not gonna like it
7350320	7356400	And you're not gonna like it
7357120	7361440	But we have to do it now or else we have lost lost
7361920	7366720	We're going for two pairs. So let's go for uranis. Of course. It doesn't show up because why would it
7367360	7369360	Because why would it show up right now?
7370320	7372080	Why would it show up?
7372080	7375520	Why not sell the egg? It's currently giving me a 10 plus at the moment
7376480	7378480	Um
7379040	7381040	Until we get
7382160	7384160	Don't mind if I do
7385040	7390080	Don't mind if I do you're not gonna like it, but we're going for two pairs shout out to all my pairs
7395760	7401920	Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right my baby don't mess around because
7403040	7405040	Because it's out for show
7406240	7408240	Oh, and that joker just came in
7408720	7411040	These two are gonna come in clutch pretty much
7411600	7417360	Yep, and I got an uranis, which is exactly what I wanted to see. We're doing it. We're we're going in two pairs two pairs
7417520	7419520	It just seems to be the matter
7419520	7421520	What are you mister?
7422000	7424000	Oh
7425520	7427520	I'm coming. Oh
7428320	7430320	Great. Okay
7431440	7433440	Egg you have done us
7434160	7436320	Christmas miracles, but your time is up
7438720	7440720	Your time is up
7441760	7443760	Your time is up. Oh my god
7444640	7446640	Right, come on uranis
7447040	7450640	Yep. Okay. Okay. We shaped it at the most perfect time
7451680	7455040	How are we looking we want to do highs maybe
7457840	7460560	Ain't nothing can you teach us more about this female biology?
7460640	7466640	I was actually gonna do a sex education stream just for the hell of it. Um, because I quite find I find it quite fascinating
7469360	7471360	Hmm
7474480	7476480	Sure
7477200	7483840	Um after play or discard always draw three cards like more
7484480	7490480	After player discard always draw three cards like three cards only
7493440	7496000	I know there's a flush there, but we're going for doubles so
7498800	7507600	We learned so much every stream. Well, I was gonna this sounds absolutely terrible. I was going to get a pair of
7508000	7514720	Basically model balls and like I was gonna do ASMR like examining your
7517120	7518080	Um
7518080	7522080	But obviously with youtube kind of switching things up. I guess that might be a twitter video
7522240	7525920	Actually, I remember many I need to put that video on twitter. I'm so sorry
7526000	7529760	I don't know why I keep coming up with cursed ideas, but I can't help it like it's fucking hilarious
7530080	7536560	I'm like I'm sorry, but imagine like ASMR me with my hands like and I've like got my nails on like oh
7536560	7540960	Sorry, I forgot to put my gloves on he he no pay no patient contact direct contact. Sorry

7563360	7569360	We have three to turn into hearts, which I'm actually gonna oh wait hold on
7570080	7575520	We actually want more hearts because of this little guy. Oh wait idea. There was another one that has a diamond
7578400	7584960	That's okay to be dumb. I'm allowed to be dumb. I'm allowed to be dumb
7586400	7592000	Being dumb is not bad being bad. It doesn't mean I'm dumb. Well, I am dumb, but you know what I mean

7611040	7614640	You're too late the disrespect you have shown me you're too late
7616320	7618640	Greedy Joker lusty Joker
7619440	7621120	Clever Joker
7621200	7626160	Mad Joker clever. I remember I used to always get called the clever girl in primary school
7626160	7628160	to be like, oh, you're such a clever girl scrawny
7629040	7632320	Self-right you're complimenting me mr. Teacher. Well, miss teacher
7632960	7636480	If it's a miss if it's a miss relax relax relax, right?
7637600	7639440	Relax no play
7639440	7641440	It's called a humor
7642000	7644000	Square Joker should I get it?
7644880	7650080	I don't know. I feel like it's too late for him. Like I've got three plus multiplier when certain car a plus
7650800	7654560	Not times, but he just gives four check like you're too late, bro
7654880	7659040	Bro, you're actually too late for bro. Right. We're gonna skip because we're getting a negative Joker
7659600	7661600	All heart cards are debuff. That's fine
7662800	7665520	That's absolutely fine with me. Are you kidding me?
7668160	7672400	You're telling me that I don't have a second double
7680800	7682800	I
7683280	7686960	Right, we're just playing doubles. I know that's the buffed and that's the buffed as well
7688080	7690480	I know I know play the flush
7691280	7694880	No, I have to go in on doubles everything is stark for doubles now
7695920	7697920	so I can't
7698640	7700640	I have to be a good girl and play doubles
7701360	7703360	We can't be tempted ill of fate
7704560	7706560	We must be good. Okay
7707280	7713360	Is there not double have I thrown so many cards away? There's no doubles. Oh, there's oh wait idiot. There's one right there
7715760	7719600	It's cuz it's blanked out. Okay. It's cuz they're blanked out. I'm dumb
7720160	7724000	All these curse medically some words are just gonna be in different rooms of the same building
7724800	7726800	Literally, right. What are you?
7728400	7733120	That's a shame, but I mean a Joker is a Joker
7733360	7735360	If it's a flush
7737920	7740400	Yeah, that's a shame. That's a shame. That's a shame
7741200	7747600	But we're gonna start redeeming packs. Our economy is good to go honestly. Sure. What's a turret if it's not a carrot?
7747760	7751760	And oh we can get 20 bucks back a steel card
7753440	7755840	Steel cards might be your saving grace
7755840	7757840	I
7760560	7763360	Dare I say a steel card might be your saving grace
7764720	7768240	If we can get a few more steel cards, uh, I would not be upset
7769440	7774320	What we looking at what we looking at creates two copies of one selected card in your hand
7778320	7781360	Diamond creates two copies of the selected card
7782720	7784720	Whoa, wait, that's
7784720	7786000	Three tall
7786000	7788000	I'm by that anyway
7788640	7793680	And then let's go again what we're going here next base shop is a polychrome
7795280	7797280	I'm full
7798160	7802320	There's no more room at the end. You can only tempt me with negative jokers now
7803840	7807120	Unless I sacrifice one of these for it
7808800	7810560	Oh
7810560	7814320	Oh, I'm sacrificing. I'm sacrificing so hard right now
7815680	7821360	On top of that the doctor one running between the room is changing outfits honestly
7823120	7829520	Um, right. I will if I have three aces of diamond, I'll get rid of um the heart joker
7832640	7835760	Are you just like saws but the game actually is
7836640	7838640	going against me
7838640	7844240	Just say you hate me. It's fine. Just say you don't like me. You don't you don't have to spell it out with the cards
7845200	7847200	Okay, there we go
7849440	7854960	Greedy and lusty are plus three easy to repair. Yeah, I'm gonna swap out lust
7856560	7860000	For whatever this hidden guy is what are you?
7860960	7862720	Play dices
7862720	7864000	Okay
7864000	7867920	Right. Goodbye lusty. You've done is pretty good to get here
7869200	7871200	Oh wait, you won't
7875600	7876720	I
7876720	7881840	No point in getting rid of him because I mean he might come in clutch somewhere
7883040	7886880	You need to go there then you're at 1.5. So you need to go over
7889680	7896160	And then we hope for urinus. Oh my a bit of urinus don't mind if I do
7897840	7901840	Uh, and then a full house technically contains a doubly. So I'll take it
7902800	7908240	I miss tours again, but how's it going? It's going good ish. We won our first move
7909200	7911600	We had to pivot in the middle of this one
7912240	7914240	There is a chance
7914400	7917600	There is a chance, but we're having to
7919360	7921360	Be very
7921840	7923840	Mmm
7930720	7933360	We're having to be on our best behavior
7936240	7938240	Because this isn't easy
7940080	7942080	I would like to keep you
7942720	7947360	We're having we're going it all in on two pairs yet again. It seems to be the best strategy
7947840	7949840	Just two pairs over and over again
7950640	7952640	Um
7953360	7955600	Just because just because
7958640	7960640	Oh my god urinus fantastic
7962720	7964720	It's not guaranteed though
7965920	7972080	It's definitely not guaranteed. What do you do not discovered? I mean we'll discover it because we can
7974720	7976720	Um
7976800	7979280	Playing cards, maybe if we can get another one of them
7980720	7982720	What are you? Whoa
7988880	7990880	That's op is fuck
7991680	7994720	Yeah, sorry, I know it's a low number, but that's so op
7995840	8000080	Hey, we are just gonna go on a bit of a buying. Oh, we got the fill
8001040	8008880	We're gonna use the fill. I'm sorry. We're gonna use it. It's it's keeping us above the requirements for the round
8010800	8018640	Hand size next very large blind. I can't swap that out. So we're gonna have to hopefully level up urinus
8020960	8025280	No one else is sorry, let me check the lens
8026240	8033520	Net and well, there's no point in that because it doesn't work. Um, low number doesn't matter when you're stacking ballies anywhere. Yeah
8037200	8045200	Oh when blind is selected gain three, but lose all this. Whoa, that is punishing. Why would anyone want that?
8045440	8047440	Oh
8049440	8055840	Okay, an ace gives me a bit extra on top two pair two pair
8058000	8064960	On a diamond, okay, we're in it. We're in it to win it. I don't know if we have it. It's not guaranteed. Oh, okay
8068160	8073280	We want to level up urinus. We really do. Sorry, I know I keep calling it urinus
8076000	8079120	Okay, that's good
8080880	8083920	We get a level up as well, which is absolutely fantastic
8085600	8089840	What are you when blind is like to create two no and then a straight no
8091040	8094240	Urinus again any urin any urinuses? Whoa
8098480	8100480	Hello, yeah
8101040	8105600	Big beak close enough, okay
8106800	8112000	By okay, okay black hole all hands plus one now curious
8113680	8117760	Curious indeed, right we will spend everything after this
8119200	8122240	We will spend every penny we can muster
8123440	8129520	Now we do have a 1.5 in here as well. So we are gonna play and throw with seven
8130480	8132480	Try and get higher doubles
8134720	8140320	Yeah, yeah, okay, and then we'll play our aces and our tens and we've done that round
8143440	8146720	How much does that get okay, we definitely need ace plays
8148160	8151520	In order to do this big bang right we can sell everything
8152160	8156400	Urinus any urinuses close enough absolutely. We've got one
8156400	8165680	Two turret cards, let's see what we're looking at and now give me us we can go all out on urinus
8172000	8179600	Someone says yeah, right we'll use the urinus so we're gonna use that now that's perfect and then we've got
8179920	8187280	So like two cards convert the left into the right
8193680	8195680	Do we want another two?
8199440	8206960	Selling the left joker make another steal. That's what I'm thinking as well
8210000	8218000	What are we looking at for the lower numbers other the odds of everything is actually on par other than higher aces and jacks
8220000	8225760	Turn the four into a steal, okay, and let's just slight two cards convert the left into the right
8226960	8229760	Okay, we now have two a lot twos
8230320	8232320	Give him a lot enema enema give him an enema
8233200	8235200	um
8235760	8237760	No
8238720	8240720	Mm-hmm
8241120	8243520	Creates a copy of a joker destroys a whoa
8244240	8245440	No
8245440	8249680	What creates a copy of a random, but destroys all other jokers
8249840	8255280	No, I think you need to show up a lot earlier than that. Are you couldn't we couldn't even do anything
8257760	8259760	We're out of money
8260000	8262000	We didn't even get anything for that
8262960	8264960	Hmm
8266720	8270000	Okay, hold on we are gonna take our sweet
8271520	8273520	our
8273520	8275520	time
8276960	8278960	I
8279520	8281520	Say
8284240	8287760	I say get rid of these
8288080	8290080	And keep
8293040	8295040	No
8295440	8298160	Get rid of all of these. I know it's a pair
8300240	8302240	But we need the ace
8305360	8307360	Anke is good early. Yeah
8308080	8312480	How's the gambadix go in we might win or lose. I'm not sure
8312720	8322160	We need the aces okay, that's exactly what we needed. However, we don't have a complimentary pair
8324960	8326960	So we're gonna do another discard
8328560	8331600	Okay, okay, we're cooking by gas
8333440	8337920	Shout out to all my pairs. We're gonna throw away the eight and we're gonna see what this ace does
8343360	8345360	Um
8347920	8349920	Okay
8351280	8353280	I'm not

8402560	8404560	If I can pull a steel card
8405200	8406800	We might be out the gutter
8406800	8413200	We are currently on the very last round of a run on a deck that we haven't done a one a win on
8414160	8417120	It's a very large bind at 300
8417920	8422640	We will win or we will riot is sevens here better instead of tens because of the diamonds
8423520	8425520	I don't know
8428800	8430800	A stream was a cluster
8430960	8436400	What did she do was it it was an ASMR that stream the ac was streaming was it?
8438400	8440400	greedy joker
8440880	8445280	Is it better with a diamond played cards with diamond give plus three
8448480	8450480	We could hold off and use that then
8453040	8456160	Oh, you're playing oh, that's right. You were playing guild wars because her
8456880	8463120	Her streaming equipment had to be on the lowest setting bless her cotton socks. I yes, I recall now. I recall
8466400	8472240	And I didn't shoot yeah, okay, I recall yeah her she had to put it on the lowest graphics. I recall I recall
8473520	8478240	Also, we gave her a wedding dress and a ring. Oh, and you ran a train on her excuse me
8478800	8484240	I beg your finest pardon. You did what in to my icy
8485840	8487840	You ran a train on my daughter

8500000	8502000	And then you ran a train on my daughter
8503520	8506400	And you didn't invite me into the culture. Excuse me
8507360	8511120	There was a dog pile at some point you ran a train on ac

8516640	8518640	daddas, okay

8526800	8530960	Come in a side ojisans like my accent makes this a stronger
8531520	8533520	The culture spot was taken rude
8534000	8536000	That's my chair. I'll have you know
8536080	8538080	What was that about chair?
8538720	8540720	Right, we're doing it. We're doing it
8541520	8545920	We've got an ace. We've got a diamond to activate on both these the eight will not count
8547200	8549360	And we've got one hand remaining so we need to
8553120	8557760	Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Oh, what does it mean?
8561920	8564480	I have the odds to pull one more ace
8565440	8567440	I have to go for the ace
8575920	8582160	Oh my god, this is so close. This is come on game. Give me the ace streamer luck. Oh
8583520	8587760	Okay, okay. We have pulled the ace. I repeat we have pulled the ace
8588720	8596400	We might as well discard the lore in case of a diamond pool of 10
8600080	8602320	In case of a diamond pool on 10
8605360	8607360	Yes
8608720	8615520	I might as well get rid of the jack and I might as well get rid of the king and pull for diamond 10
8618640	8625040	Yep. Yep. This is the best way to do it and maybe a steal
8627840	8632480	Unlucky well we can submit our jacks then
8634960	8638720	They didn't pull the two such a shame they didn't pull the two
8638720	8640720	I
8644960	8652960	Want to use the tens for scholar scholar scholar played aces give
8658080	8660080	This is it. This is the best we can do
8660160	8662160	I
8666240	8670000	Throw the two out there. Why not? I'm just giving them a little two
8673360	8676560	We don't even have anything like that. I just give them a two as a tip. Okay
8679280	8681280	Okay, well
8683840	8685840	Let's see
8686400	8688400	Do we do it

8829680	8832800	We'll redirect into a yumi plus girl once I go offline
8832960	8837600	You will start to notice that the highlights of the girl's debuts go up again
8837680	8841920	I will do it in order of who debuted first. So it goes ac and azura then
8842560	8845760	Mercy then emmy then she be then me last. Okay
8846800	8849200	So they're all gonna pop up roughly at the same time
8849520	8853360	Like uh, maybe 15 minutes apart because it takes a while to fucking do all the descriptions
8854000	8856000	But please do look out for that
8856640	8858640	Do I want a cup of tea?
8858640	8860640	I don't know. I'm a feeling a cup of tea
8861520	8863520	Or do I just want to go again?
8863840	8865840	The plane has hit vila headquarters
8866240	8869920	And the funny thing is we actually do have a headquarters, which is the most funniest
8870400	8876800	We we considered accepting mail at the headquarters location on behalf of the girls, but it's not possible
8880160	8881520	Um
8881520	8885120	We thought about it because we were we discussed having po boxes
8885200	8891760	But um, unfortunately with the rise of air tags and trackers we cannot accept mail at anyone
8892240	8897040	I said to the girls I was like not then you open up po boxes. I understand if you're interested
8897360	8899920	At first I was gonna test it out myself. Um
8901440	8907920	Because I can get packages sent to the headquarters. I know that sounds fucking ridiculous, but there is like, I know
8908320	8910320	Yeah, believe it or not. Um
8910320	8912320	But then I was like
8913200	8915200	I would have to open up all the packages
8915680	8919440	At the headquarters location to make sure there's no air tags or anything
8919920	8921920	Um, or any biohazard stuff
8922720	8926000	And then it was like I was gonna have to rent out a freaking conference room
8926080	8929040	And then I was gonna have to go through all the packages and then it kind of defeats the
8929280	8932880	This surprise because like opening stuff up on stream is like quite funny
8933440	8935440	You want an officer? I mean
8936800	8938800	I mean
8939280	8942240	I can give you a boardroom meeting tour if you want man
8943280	8945280	Like the actual boardrooms
8945600	8949280	How am I supposed to poison the staff? Why would you want to poison the staff? What the fuck?
8949920	8951920	I'm part of the staff the fuck
8953760	8958160	Better keep it safe virtual headquarters. Nope physical location headquarters
8960880	8964080	Actual physical location headquarters. I know cringe
8965040	8970720	How did she do it ladies and gentlemen mods just that man's balls mods get that man. Don't leave us moment
8971040	8973040	Wait, so no cup of tea or cup of tea
8974800	8978080	Um, you'd also have to check the inside of the item for an air tag. Yeah, like the
8978800	8980800	It just gets so dangerous
8980800	8984240	Unless I was to record the video at the headquarters
8984800	8987840	And then take back what I desired
8988480	8991840	A new was safe home and I would have to buy like a tracker as well
8991840	8993840	But tracker devices don't always work
8994160	8996160	tracker detector
8996560	9002960	Wouldn't you get a higher sniff dog? No, I don't think can dogs sense like motherboards and stuff
9004400	9006000	And
9006000	9012640	Yeah, I know it's a shame because I would absolutely enjoy being streamers do like those like accepting your packages type things
9013200	9016080	And like someone like sprays fart spray or something on it
9016320	9020960	Although I think one of the sadder ones I caught was like someone sent someone ladybugs
9021120	9026800	But they all died and I was like that is actually really sad. It's not much of a prank is it if
9028080	9030080	We little things perish for it
9032160	9035520	But you could also just amp the box. Oh, let me just oh, sorry
9035920	9040080	I forgot to mention have amp grenades just sitting next to my seed collection. Yeah
9041120	9042080	Um
9042080	9045280	Don't send live animals or insects in the milk. Yeah, it was like
9045920	9049280	I can't remember if it made like headlines or whatever
9049680	9056000	But someone purchased like 10 000 ladybugs and sent it. But obviously, you know, there is no
9057600	9059200	um
9059200	9061200	There was no
9061680	9065280	Like refrigeration to put them to sleep in the travel
9065680	9069360	It was like in the heat in the boxes getting thrown about and when they arrive
9069360	9073920	Obviously, they all had perished and I seem to remember that story in particular because I'm so sad
9075360	9080640	It feels weird man. As long as there's no iphone within 100 meters. Don't air tags not work. Just open them up and
9081520	9083520	I have no idea
9084080	9086800	Sadly doggos can't sniff out an rtx 490
9087360	9092080	Kind of better that they died. They could be invasive. Uh ladybugs are invasive
9094240	9098160	Little ladybug little ladybird. We we actually say ladybird in the uk
9099040	9100480	Little ladybird
9100480	9105760	Wouldn't a microwave do this? You want me to microwave everything that comes through in the packages? Just shove it in there
9106640	9108640	No, that's fine. It's fine. Just shove in
9111680	9113680	It depends on the breed
9113760	9115760	Harley Quinn ladybugs. Okay
9117280	9118880	I'm gonna name that right
9118880	9125200	Start the run with no face cards in your deck. Let's see how bad this is and it's called abandoned deck
9125680	9134800	We do have an uncommon joker for free. So I might be interested in that. What are you after gain 25 economies?
9141360	9145920	That is more money than we'll make doing that. Right. Fuck it. We're going all in boys. We're going all in
9148160	9151920	Wait, so we still get aces. We just don't get okay. Okay. So get aces
9152080	9156880	Uh, let's throw you guys away
9158720	9160880	Wow, that did nothing. Please don't ever do that again
9163120	9165120	Okay, we've got a full house. Let's go
9166880	9171280	I'm gonna send myself to valer hq. Oh, do you remember that prank?
9172160	9178640	Um, we're like these people claim they ship themselves and then an airline had to come out and be like, don't be so effing ridiculous
9178640	9185840	Of course these people didn't ship themselves through a fucking box or something because they like it was like a prank youtube channel
9185840	9188320	And they were oh, yeah, we totally shipped ourselves
9190320	9195360	And it was like don't be so ridiculous like the airline had to get involved in publicly like denounce them
9196160	9201360	For being so silly. Wow. Okay. Yes. That was that was definitely worth it. Right. You're free
9202320	9205600	Sell this card to create a free double tag. What does that even mean?
9206160	9210320	This joker gains when a booster pack is skipped
9217520	9223840	Interesting if your airship a living creature is cargo what you get at the other end of the corpse basically
9225840	9231760	Face cards hardy hardy hard adds double the rank of the lowest card. I mean that's better than nothing
9232160	9236160	If I skip a booster pack, I mean, I might as well go down there
9236960	9240960	Not really fuss for consumable slow at this point in time
9242240	9244960	What are we up against? Oh, we've got a negative
9246400	9248400	All heart cards are too fast
9249680	9251680	Well
9252560	9254560	Next round I guess
9254800	9260960	All right, we're gonna go for the negative. We're gonna select a booster pack a booster pack any booster pack lovers
9262000	9264640	We'll go for a pair and throw away the four of you
9266080	9271600	Open tarot and skip it. Oh wait, if you open the the pack and then skip it it adds to it
9271600	9274400	I thought it meant skip it entirely. Okay, that makes
9275280	9277200	slightly more sense
9277200	9284400	Than the way I envisioned it in my head. I'm here. I'm here. I do apologize for that one. Okay. I understand then
9284480	9288800	This is the first time I've had this guy involved. So we're getting there
9289760	9294000	Right air in five bucks if three or more face cards
9302560	9304560	I might as well buy it and sell it I guess
9306800	9310480	What a joke I skipped for that
9311200	9319840	Right, so if I buy and then skip it, which is fine. I'm happy to skip that. That's not really a big deal
9320400	9321600	and skip
9321600	9322720	Oh
9322720	9324720	Whoa, okay
9324960	9326960	Bye
9327120	9329120	What do you do plan out?
9330640	9332640	That's actually pretty good. Hold on a minute
9335440	9338960	Oh, you need to face your problems. I can't believe it. I have no face cards
9339520	9341520	That's honestly pretty good though
9345920	9347920	But if I skip
9348880	9350320	Yeah
9350320	9357760	I'm going to do the tarot card one because it naturally gives us the goods. I don't really need a consumable swap. So, you know
9358960	9360960	already have
9361440	9366720	Nine eight seven six five four three two. Of course. I don't have what I need
9367280	9370480	Give me a seven or something. Whoa
9372000	9374960	Uh, you never normally do that for me. So thanks buddy
9378320	9381520	Ten nine eight seven six, so
9382560	9384560	You ever do these two?
9387280	9390560	Sugar I only have one more discard left
9391520	9395040	So what I need a seven
9396000	9402640	Are the odds of a seven? Oh seven's pretty high. Fuck it. You know what you know what you cheeky fuck
9407600	9409600	You cheeky
9410480	9416160	You cheeky cheeky right, but we've got three more hands. So it's fine. But I need a seven or five or something
9416560	9418560	Oh
9420080	9422080	This game has jokes
9429200	9432880	Nothing but jokes clearly why did I get four there?
9436880	9438880	What did you I don't know
9439360	9441360	I mean, I guess
9442080	9444240	I wasn't even paying attention. Okay
9444880	9451520	If first hand of round has only one card add a permanent copy to deck and
9452240	9454000	to deck
9454000	9456000	and you come
9456080	9458080	and you come
9458640	9460640	And then again if we
9461680	9464720	Yeah, if first hand of round
9464880	9473680	Has only one card plate add a permanent copy of that card to the deck and draw it to the hand
9477040	9479040	Okay
9479520	9481920	Right, we're gonna skip these to get a little busty-wusty
9482640	9484240	unless
9484240	9486240	Should we go out all out on aces?
9487280	9490480	Fuck it. If it's got an ace, I'm taking it. If it's got an ace, I'm taking it
9491200	9495440	Uh, we're gonna skip that and then we're gonna add to a little multiplier here
9496400	9498000	What are you?
9498000	9502720	Planet card uncommon joker for free first hand is drawn face down
9504160	9505600	right
9505600	9507600	He's twitching. He's ready
9509840	9512000	Yeah, we're going all out on aces. Fuck it
9515040	9518160	She we've got five aces now
9519120	9525520	The unit works well for four of the kinds of clone 800 aces literally and that's the plan
9526400	9528400	10 9 8 7
9528960	9534080	Of course, that was too good to be true. Let's do double b's and five why not?
9536960	9538960	Surely this is the correct move
9541440	9544480	Oh, we did it. Oh, wow. Okay. That was good. That was good. Um
9548160	9550400	Sell the card to disable the current no
9555840	9561520	So what am I going for? I don't know. I don't really know what I'm going for
9567360	9569360	Just skip
9570080	9573360	I don't really have anything shaping what we want to do at the moment
9574000	9575120	Um
9575120	9578960	Never seen this game before. What's the goal? It's like a
9579760	9583440	Someone says it's a rogue like but with poker mechanics. Yes
9584000	9590000	Um, there's a lot of different aspects to the game. It's gonna look absolutely chaotic right now. Um,
9590480	9593760	But it's quite an easy and tampering since free money
9594880	9596880	You make money forever
9596960	9598960	Oh
9599280	9601120	Yes, basically
9601120	9607360	I don't know if it's better to skip to keep getting this up. I feel like that's gonna add up over time like really big
9609760	9611760	I'm sure I'm gonna regret it, but
9612400	9616400	Oh wait, I could have got more money to buy more packs. You know what?
9617360	9620320	I might not be the smartest, but I'm here for a good time again
9620640	9623520	We're gonna have to skip because we don't even have anything that
9624160	9625920	is
9626000	9630080	Shaping our deck other than this really doubles the lowest
9630960	9635440	I don't even know what that means and we're gonna try and get more aces. What's going on here?
9636880	9638880	Did we go for a free joker?
9643200	9645200	Fuck it
9646000	9648000	Oh, this is terrible
9648880	9659280	Now the odds of us pilling an ace are high so what if we just no don't sell it you give her play
9664480	9666480	Okay
9667920	9669920	Okay, okay, okay
9673120	9675120	Okay
9675600	9677600	Then we just throw it away
9678880	9680880	Which is a shame to do
9684000	9688480	Now I'm noticing this one isn't budging anywhere which makes me think it's an ace
9694080	9699380	I'm gonna regret this but hey, oh right. We've got a duple V and we'll get rid of the three
9705840	9713280	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I mean we're kind of looking at two pair again, especially with the amount of aces we're getting
9716640	9720560	And we're about to get a Saturn no urenus close enough
9722560	9726240	Close enough close enough right urenus will level up her two pair rewards
9728000	9730800	I can't get away from two pairs. I honestly can't eat
9731040	9733040	Okay
9736880	9738400	Not the best
9738400	9741520	Because we actually want to keep skipping packs that we open
9742560	9745120	One, you know, we'll just buy everything
9747440	9751680	Multi-card steel card joker must have room. Well, I just lost room so
9753680	9756480	You could have tried for a four of a kind on the aces
9757360	9760800	Yes, we're going to work towards that
9762480	9764480	Right, we're gonna buy these and skip them
9765920	9767600	a sigil and
9767600	9773680	Yeah, again, not really a Ouija just sounds like a terrible idea. Converse all cards in hand to a single random suit
9773840	9779040	No, we're not doing flushes. We're doing double base. We're gonna skip. We've got now plus 15 on this bad boy
9779280	9781280	Again, we're gonna open up a joker
9782960	9784480	No
9784560	9788560	We're gonna skip again. We've just never plus 18. We're absolutely
9789200	9791920	Having a good time with him. We're gonna see if we're gonna duplicate
9800000	9806240	Would we give what would we give up sell this card to create a free double tag? What does that even mean?
9809600	9813840	What is a double tag gives a copy of the next selected tag
9814480	9816480	So
9816720	9818720	That what
9825120	9827620	Next time you skip the effect happens twice
9839040	9842320	Huh all right you're twitching
9844880	9846880	You
9849680	9851680	Steel steel ace
9857360	9864160	Beautiful oh that actually played for you a bit of money there a steel card steal the two
9866880	9868880	And then we've got two multipliers on the deck
9871360	9873360	And then do what up here
9875280	9883520	Not the two put it on the sick
9887520	9889520	Um
9894640	9897680	I don't know what to try and roll for maybe another ace
9899280	9904000	Keep the four try and roll for an ace. Okay. There you go. There you go. Exactly what we wanted
9904640	9910560	Uh, throw me the two. Um, we've got two. Yeah, hold on. We're gonna end up with you
9914560	9916560	Hey
9917360	9919520	How much work was the cola putting in?
9922720	9926080	That wasn't that really wasn't that good
9926320	9928320	So
9932480	9934480	Hey, I'm gonna lose
9941200	9943200	The cola did nothing
9945760	9951920	Oh, but I'm gonna get two holographics if I win though easy win on what show me what four ever came
9956880	9958880	There's two more aces to pull
9960400	9962400	Could do five of a kind
9962640	9964720	What should I just try and pull for another ace?
9968080	9971760	Five of a kind should be more than enough bloody. Oh, so
9973280	9980240	Oh, there you go. I still could technically get another one. Fuck it. Ah, I could do imagine though
9980320	9987040	So what I want to do these four and then have the 1.5 and 1.5
9988320	9992240	I'm okay. We're saying goodbye to the planet. It's not the biggest deal five aces
9995280	10000720	Oh, that's way stronger. Holy crap. Yeah, that's way stronger
10003040	10005040	All right
10006000	10013520	God that was not a rolling smoke though. These two negative jokers we're gonna get they better be good. It not negative
10015120	10017120	Are you joking me?
10024000	10025760	Right that's free
10025760	10029520	So we're gonna get it and then sell it because it's fucking rubbish
10030480	10035680	And then we're gonna get the probability one. I know that gives me fat like but it's gonna expire
10036480	10040000	I'd rather pick this up than something that expires
10041520	10043280	You know
10043280	10045280	Like at least this is perma
10046400	10048720	So anytime small player you need to go the back
10049520	10054480	But you won't plan it any planet card that's used. I might just start buying
10055120	10057120	Anyway, I start buying
10058080	10063440	Right, we're just gonna start using cards to get this times up. I know I shouldn't and I should skip but
10065200	10068160	Fuck we're just ruining our economy for this. It's fine
10068720	10072160	Right, and then we're gonna skip and then that will raise him a little bit
10073440	10075440	Play only one. Oh, we've lost
10081200	10083200	We just need to go for aces
10083440	10088640	He says yep aces
10090320	10092320	He says
10093680	10096480	Shit well, we've only got one hand
10101680	10104640	Shopping the day, I don't know who got it. I don't think so
10106880	10111280	Oh my god buy a freaking ball here. Whoa not good
10111280	10115600	We need we need improvements right now
10117520	10119520	Right now we need improvements
10127120	10129120	We need improvements right now
10134000	10136000	I think raised fist
10136720	10138720	We're gonna swap you out for free
10139680	10143680	Yeah, sorry you're we're trying with you, but you're not doing enough
10145760	10147760	Um
10149040	10151040	We're
10151120	10154640	We're needing to level him up. He's gonna come in clutch over time as well
10156720	10158720	I
10160320	10163120	I know we need to skip packs. I know
10163360	10169040	I should maybe level up four of a kind five of a kind later do
10176880	10181920	I know I should try and hold on to economy, but we're trying to catch up with the demands
10183280	10186720	Of the game right now and it's not doing well
10187680	10189680	I
10190240	10192240	1.5 I think
10194400	10199440	I think yes for 1.5 on something something's gonna get swapped out for a 1.5
10200560	10205600	What are you cards played previously or debuffed? Okay lucky me wait, so don't play my fucking aces
10208080	10215200	Uh three of a kind I could test out. I am not obviously I don't have a I could discard though for an ace
10216720	10218720	Oh
10219360	10221360	Oh
10236080	10244320	We leveled up ten wait hold on let's check three of a kind is like a thousand
10246800	10251600	And then two pairs what's four of a kind four of a kind
10252880	10256000	Is weaker so three of a kind for now
10263280	10265280	And then another three of a kind
10267760	10270240	Four of a kind fives they're weaker though
10270480	10271600	So
10271600	10279440	Wait, but this will let me level up four of a kind which I want for the aces because I'm going to keep duplicating the aces
10280720	10282720	Yes
10283280	10285280	I would like to duplicate the aces
10285920	10287920	Wait what?
10289760	10291760	Oh no
10293120	10295120	Oh no, wait what?
10295120	10297120	Oh
10297360	10299360	Oh no
10299520	10302160	I should have used the three of a kind sorry
10304240	10308240	I messed that up. Oh, I thought maybe we could have had that. Oh, we got joker unlock
10308960	10311120	Sell a total of 50 cards upgrade the
10311840	10314960	Upgrade the level of the first discarded poker hand each round
10315760	10317760	interesting
10318000	10319120	Oh
10319120	10324080	Chat didn't math I didn't math either. So the high table scammed you exactly
10324720	10330720	Not discovered purchaser use this card in an unceded run to learn what it does. I like that
10331360	10336320	We messed up. No, it's okay. I actually thought that was the best choice because I would have got two
10337280	10338960	um
10338960	10345200	Two upgrades for four of a pair and because I've been going crazy on the aces that actually would have came in quite well
10346000	10351200	Um, I am going to redirect into yumi plus girl

10848800	10850960	Uh, that's going to be a bit in the future
10851680	10855280	Uh, for anyone who watched they want to start your own vtuber agency
10855600	10860480	If you pause um at the scene where a reference sheet is going in the bin
10860880	10865040	You can see my old reference sheet. Um, it is very true
10865120	10870080	That's a little behind the scenes if you saw that chart. Um, I got reference sheets for everyone
10870080	10872400	But they ended up coming out incorrect
10872560	10876480	So I had to get new ones made and I ended up spending a lot of money
10877520	10879040	And it was a bit of a waste
10879040	10883920	But hey, you you live and you learn you I learned so much from uh doing gen one
10884480	10889440	But if you pause on that chart, you can literally see my old reference sheet and the back panels
10889920	10891920	I can actually show you the
10893680	10895040	Okay, sorry
10895040	10900160	You see the back panel ones you see, um, so you know how I have the green front panely ones

10903200	10909120	Uh, we're actually designed to be brown to match my yukata, but uh, we ended up
10909920	10912240	Um changing it because it looked a bit
10913440	10918480	Uh unique on content juice. I never show this. No wonder I never show this that is outrageous
10918880	10920880	Who designed that?
10920960	10922960	Hey
10922960	10924960	It's outrageous. I can't believe I even possible
10925840	10927840	Anyway, anyway
10928480	10930560	Anyway, bikini stream one
10934000	10939840	Yes, we'll have to find an alternative. Yes, just finished the john wick vaude. Uh, yeah an absolute shambles
10939840	10943120	That's why we're gambin today, but please don't worry if you had enough of beltro

10964000	10965520	and what
10965520	10968640	um, I wanted to get it, but I was well
10969120	10972480	YouTube's already put me on a warning so I'm trying to behave as best as I can
10973440	10978160	So I don't but mommies grippers. Yes, those are my grippers my french tip manicure pedicure
10979440	10981040	um, I

10987840	10990800	You want a backside of your model show off the huge dumpy?
10990880	10996640	Honestly, there would be so much on show. I couldn't get away with it because the back of my design
10997120	10999120	Well, I guess it's like a frilly dress
11000080	11002080	But I guess it's not too bad
11003280	11007360	You should think about hardcore henry for a watch along if you're into action movies
11007440	11013200	But filmed entirely in first person. So if you're bad with motion sickness, no, I actually don't get motion sickness
11013840	11020320	Apparently azura and mercy do I did not realize how common motion sickness in videos games were
11021040	11022480	I
11022480	11027280	I said, uh, this I guess this is just ignorance, but because I don't know better
11027920	11029120	um
11029120	11032800	I'm just like, oh, it's not a problem for me. So why would it be a problem for the masses?
11033600	11034960	Oh, um
11034960	11038640	Buckshot really it's also going to be multiplayer soon tm. I don't know when it drops
11038720	11041520	But when it does drop don't be surprised if there's collapse coming up
11042720	11044320	um
11044320	11046320	That's a good movie. Yeah the dumpy
11047840	11048960	um
11048960	11054560	All right, I won't steal too much more of your time because the girls are probably waiting on their highlight reels going up
11054800	11062480	So thank you so so much for keeping me company. I appreciate it greatly. I'll see you tomorrow for a binding of isaac
11062480	11067200	I get to nerd out about binding of isaac and before you're like, oh, do you know every single item and what it does?

11087360	11092480	Uh, I don't even know if greed mode multiplayer is possible. That would be hilarious. How like crazy it gets
11092960	11095920	Um, can't wait for the highlights to go up. Yeah, thank you
11096240	11102960	I completely messed up my stream. My music was too loud. So the guy that edited it tried to like reduce the music
11103040	11106880	But my voice sounds a bit funny. Um, but it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine
11107840	11110080	It tried his best editor tried his best. Um
