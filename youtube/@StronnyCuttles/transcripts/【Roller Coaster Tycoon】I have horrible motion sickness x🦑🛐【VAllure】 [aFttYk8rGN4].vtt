00:59.500 --> 01:07.420
to capture it's really close to the revamped or something hello I sorry I

01:07.420 --> 01:12.220
took so long I was just discovered I was blocked by a vtuber on Twitter because

01:12.220 --> 01:21.580
I posted my income laughing because I just showed mercy at mercies like wait I know her

01:21.580 --> 01:29.820
that's a streamer I'm like oh right anyway so I've just got the tea but it's fine the

01:29.820 --> 01:38.060
tea's fine what the heck can I see it right I'll DM you at Denver but apparently it's a streamer I

01:38.060 --> 01:44.060
didn't recognize them and then mersey's like what the fuck I know her like oh well she hates me

01:45.180 --> 01:54.540
because wait wait I'll quote it well I quote it I mean it's not I just find it funny that

01:54.540 --> 01:59.260
they insulted me and then popped off I have no idea because it blocked me but there you go Denver

01:59.260 --> 02:06.940
there's the tea don't clock it too hard how pet literally it's it oh fuck I'll just read the

02:06.940 --> 02:13.260
comment because it's funny one hour ago that's because you're a part of a lude smaller agency

02:13.260 --> 02:18.780
in quotation marks well yeah I start from the ground up you think this is hollow life

02:19.580 --> 02:23.340
which honestly has to be the easiest job with pay pigs and I'm like

02:28.220 --> 02:34.780
that is so fucking rude to the viewer that is so fucking rude to the viewer I am so sorry

02:35.660 --> 02:44.140
but those attitudes and nastiness is why if you do not show your appreciation

02:45.100 --> 02:52.780
in the basic way in any way you can so last night for example I recorded two collab ASMRs and then

02:52.780 --> 02:58.700
more SFX and all that shit I've had seven hours of sleep because I'm also juggling everything for

02:58.700 --> 03:05.340
my daughters um I'm streaming every day and like I'm trying to show appreciation for the people

03:05.340 --> 03:11.580
that do enjoy me and watch me and someone's analysis was it must be so fun having pay pigs

03:11.580 --> 03:21.980
no motherfucker ew don't be so fucking gross honestly a damn no fandom here rip rip but anyway

03:22.620 --> 03:27.580
I'm a good pay piggy though no don't encourage her don't encourage her she's gonna hate me

03:27.580 --> 03:30.620
well she blocked me so she didn't give a shit about me I can't believe it

03:31.340 --> 03:38.220
streamer doesn't like me what am I gonna do oh well I guess ASMR collab with her is off the cards

03:40.620 --> 03:45.180
hold on let me take my clothes off it's a bit a bit hot in here damn

03:46.700 --> 03:52.780

29:04.860 --> 29:11.900
oh wait the closer you go the louder the screams are but the far away you are you can't hear nothing

29:13.500 --> 29:15.900
I'm used to getting charged 50 cents for a pee

29:19.340 --> 29:23.740
that's outrageous it's amazing that she finds something she genuinely hates her accent comes

29:23.740 --> 29:30.540
out and descends to Scottish rage real true I told my dad since Tottenham that I've been

29:31.260 --> 29:35.900
I've noticed that I've got a little bit more like Scottish twang to me when he's here because he

29:35.900 --> 29:43.900
has a much stronger accent than me here in the short um but he has a much stronger accent than

29:43.900 --> 29:49.660
I did is anyone being sick oh get that cleaned up where's my Johnny's

29:49.900 --> 29:54.460
so like location

29:57.180 --> 30:01.580
well the footpath for one go clean up your minger wait

30:03.820 --> 30:07.740
he'll only do those tails no that can't be right

30:12.460 --> 30:18.460
don't don't do that no he need no undo whatever you're doing whatever you're doing undo it

30:19.340 --> 30:23.500
right do not be stuck on that path in or that's literally up

30:27.820 --> 30:32.220
whoo no he's fine he's fine he's fine he's fine right okay it's fine it's fine

30:32.780 --> 30:38.940
that was I really did not want him to do that wages $50 per month that's more than except

30:41.020 --> 30:46.220
right so what was my objective I forgot but if it's 30 I don't want to see if I can

30:46.220 --> 30:50.460
guarantee a clean toilet oh yeah real to be honest I think it's not brain happy

30:52.540 --> 30:56.300
I'm glad I'm sorry it's so skill but at the same time

30:57.740 --> 31:01.580
hold on I need to turn this down a little bit I turned it down just a teeny tiny bit

31:02.460 --> 31:07.980
I noticed at the start of my streaming I didn't realize how much I had to turn down the game sound

31:07.980 --> 31:13.260
I have to all my games are played at like negative like 10 11 decibels type thing

31:14.220 --> 31:19.580
and you can build a coaster now oh god oh damn for your really challenging me though but I've

31:19.580 --> 31:25.180
never done one how does it right hold on monorail no that can't be it

31:26.860 --> 31:33.340
oh there's a racetrack I just saw that new raid attraction looping roller coaster do not tempt me

31:33.340 --> 31:51.740
fellow temptress hold on hold on what wait I've not unlocked it haunted house fairs wheel

how right okay so POV I'm too scared to build my own roller coaster all right and then this is a

32:31.020 --> 32:31.900
this is what I see

32:37.900 --> 32:43.980
how do you know what's going on is this the same coaster okay can we just pretend this is my park

32:43.980 --> 32:51.660
for a second though like for real for real I'm so successful how how how can you even see what

32:51.660 --> 32:58.060
you're doing I don't I do different claw roller coasters it must be look at the path then but

32:58.060 --> 33:05.260
like there's no benches for the people the smallest grid and can do and overlay and everything

33:05.260 --> 33:11.740
where's the star it's just blinding there's some autistic talent right there pat pat there's so

33:11.740 --> 33:23.740
much autistic talent in here

33:23.740 --> 33:33.740
it's my party

33:37.180 --> 33:43.980
okay right right uh we've not unlocked out sorry I've completely just zoned out there I apologize

33:44.540 --> 33:49.500
uh I don't know what happened there I just stopped talking that was really odd please don't do that

33:49.500 --> 33:55.980
again that made me uncomfortable um sorry I don't know how long I was quiet for but I literally was

33:55.980 --> 34:04.060
like hmm where you this of course right I don't think we can actually manually build a roller

34:04.060 --> 34:14.060
coaster yet you know that I think we actually can wooden roller coaster junior and look this game

34:14.060 --> 34:22.940
is for tizm kings and queens honestly real true we love it oh I can rotate right go do the haunted

34:22.940 --> 34:31.180
mansion yeah haunted mansion time right you and you oh but I'm getting so good at that oh this is

34:32.300 --> 34:39.260
oh that's like messing with me the rotation but it makes sense that it will take okay and then rotate

34:39.260 --> 34:49.900
again and then again okay and then do that okay and then open okay so do we now have a haunted

34:49.900 --> 34:54.380
mansion we're down to 800 dollars we're cutting it pretty low not gonna lie not gonna lie it's

34:54.380 --> 34:59.580
getting pretty low hope these marbles is affordable are those screams of death are the folk flying off

34:59.580 --> 35:07.740
the roller coaster wait how does it go oh I would go on this roller coaster if it doesn't go upside

35:07.820 --> 35:15.100
down or like make me violently ill then I think I could manage the g-force on this part this little

35:15.100 --> 35:22.300
cylindrical are you guys gonna oh there's two carts at a time all right okay so when that one docks

35:22.300 --> 35:31.820
that one gets ready to go okay build your best death trap coaster I'm sure I've read a meme about

35:31.820 --> 35:38.700
some guy you can have a park right next to like another AI part and they had to like out do it and

35:38.700 --> 35:44.940
the way they did it was they threw a coaster off into their park and the game registered it as a coaster

35:44.940 --> 35:54.060
day um on the other part and it like plummeted their numbers or something are those screams of joy

35:54.060 --> 36:00.780
or dread you have to find out yourself I scream on the other coasters I said what I said okay I scream

36:00.780 --> 36:07.020
on coaster that's right your name's coaster I'll be screaming that's all right it's too easy stopping

36:08.060 --> 36:13.340
right so wait we have 300 guests at a time

36:13.500 --> 36:21.820
if I'm park rating it went down and then it went up okay

36:23.180 --> 36:30.380
guests in park wait does that need 600 at one time the admission price is free wait I could be

36:30.380 --> 36:38.620
making so much smack a reason to have at least 250 guests in your park at the end of October

36:38.620 --> 36:45.020

37:00.700 --> 37:11.740
okay okay tell you oh I can't even change it oh the game maybe the game dictates what your

37:11.740 --> 37:19.980
entry fee is gonna be I mean I think we're doing okay a little scuffed out in the middle of nowhere

37:19.980 --> 37:24.780
but uh down and up then I thought we were talking about the game not how we have to

37:25.740 --> 37:30.860

41:21.740 --> 41:30.780

was produced oh did you see that ghost from the window do it again do it again there's a ghost that

42:19.740 --> 42:28.780
came out of this window here benches reduce nausea and without bins they will drop garbage on the ground

42:30.540 --> 42:35.740
I mean oh like there's two now they're they're doing the thing oh like I see you

42:39.340 --> 42:43.260
you can drown people in this damper of course you would know that

42:44.700 --> 42:48.860
by the way you can do commit mass murder in a theme park damper

42:50.140 --> 42:55.020
damper you're supposed to say that part of it Danny changed the pathing type they're like

42:55.020 --> 42:59.420
I don't know what they're expecting to think oh he's got food in his hand

43:00.780 --> 43:03.980
apparently their original game was made by one person which is pretty

43:04.940 --> 43:11.260
insane if you think about it new attraction and information kiosk how is that how is that an

43:11.260 --> 43:19.180
attraction how is that an attraction a stall where guests can obtain maps and purchase umbrellas oh

43:19.660 --> 43:30.860
oh another another profit you see okay can we open you up right away yeah a map is 60 cents

43:30.860 --> 43:40.220
and an umbrella is 250 but well hopefully she's just giving you good of it yeah the guy made

43:40.220 --> 43:48.140
everything himself in the weirdest coding language but if he did wait yeah yeah it was it was a one

43:48.140 --> 43:54.620
man army and he went absolutely uh just out the wazoo with it he did fantastic

43:57.660 --> 43:59.340

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:42.220
oh my god sorry the developer puts so much love into this game he was bothered enough on his

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:48.700
arse to make hooses and like places where they're thinking mummies are so big it's smothering the

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:55.020
concept of time literally this stream gave me a base crush gives you the gluck gluck in the tunnel

01:10:55.420 --> 01:11:04.460

why can i not have charge admission why do i need permission to charge admission

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:41.740
as a british feel offended it's actually very developed literally there's a big massive coaster

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.820
you might be able to buy some buildings on there wait we're gonna demolish family homes in the

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:55.740
name of expansion that's pretty cool right have we got any food or drink not that i can visually see

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:04.460
there's no food and drink right let's deal with that before we get in trouble a chip shop

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:11.500
i that's the most british thing you could ask for for as soon as you end no stop right and then

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:17.580
hate them motherfucking prices up make it two dollars for chips welcome to the real world mother

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:24.860
everything is charged out that and then drinks yep can't get more british than that

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:32.060
a little drink a syringe enter two dollars for drinks pause okay okay we are gonna and then we

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:39.420
want an information kiosk boom just like that pause no i'm not ready yet put the map up to a dollar

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:45.500
put the broilies up to three okay what else do we need what else do we need we need a toilet

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:53.660
so everyone can go for a job at home and then let's charge out the arse for it literally let's

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:59.260
charge you to release your arse okay there's a pun in there but i can't figure it out okay the next

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:06.300
next we need nothing because we've covered all the basic okay we are gonna put two shitters over

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:14.780
here as well though i do not trust park guests not to like just fucking shit themselves i like

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.940
some of the horror stories i hear about theme parks is like fully grown adults just shitting

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:24.220
themselves rather like because they're like oh we couldn't find the bathroom so i shat myself and

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:29.100
it's like what do you want to rephrase that again i don't understand what you've just communicated

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:36.460
to me it's like i shat myself um what do you mean what do you why didn't you go to the toilet

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:43.500
oh it took too long it took too long what took too long oh the toilet the toilet i took it

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:54.860
what i could never what the heck are the one guy built this oh my gosh

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.340
real

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:01.900
no

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:15.580
what on earth um well i certainly haven't got the price tag for any of those but it says

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:26.620
ones 2,800 who's 2,800 who's 2,800 where's rick don't care where's rick

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:33.740
2,800 2,800 2,800 i don't see it

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:43.700
It's shown me fears that don't, some people really are grown children, real true, um,

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:48.220
modern real cycles, special bicycle runs on a steel motor track propelled by the peddle

01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.220
of the rider.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:57.420
Oh that looks fun, oh my god sorry I would go on that, excitement rating, how is that

01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.420
one less?

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.420
Why is that one more?

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:09.780
Intensity and thingy, well this one is cheaper and has more excitement rating, so who am

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:17.260
I to stop him, right, now let's actually do the proper passing okay, oh wait it already

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:23.260
has a proper queue, oh man I love the pre-built stuff, are you joking, I literally don't even

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:29.980
have to think, I love it, right open and charge a bit more, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:35.980
What about you, where's the, is this the entrance?

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:40.580
It's four dollars per roller coaster ride, what about you?

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:50.980
Carousel, let's bump you up to a dollar, um, wheel, wheel, let's bump you up by 50 cent,

01:15:50.980 --> 01:16:04.340
okay and then go, or should I just buy another coaster, I've got 2300, I'm tempted, but these

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:13.580
are all like low water tricycles, peddle tricycles with large buoyant wheels, oh no absolutely

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:21.700
not, I'm not doing any of that, don't ask me to do that again, observation tower, nope

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:32.940
what the heck, right, bump votes, single circular ding, dingies powered by central motor, no

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.420
I'm not custom building anything, I'm too scared okay, the pre-builds were safe but

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:42.620
they eventually become too boring for the intents, the extra 50 cents on the wheel cost

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:52.100
is to cover clean up from all the handies, what is going on, right, I don't, a monorail,

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:58.380
a miniature railway, I am not custom building anything, I do not trust myself, right, these

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:07.380
are going to be too boring I think, miniature railway, monorail, custom design layer, right,

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:18.660
I guess we'll just do it from there and save up for, save up for, that's a scream out of

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:27.100
nowhere, let's see what the guests are thinking, this park map from in is really good, I'm

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:35.420
not hungry, okay but what do you guys from over here think, I feel sick, sit down, sit,

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:46.660
down, sit down, sit down, no not that one, not that one, everyone sit down that gets off of

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:53.260
this roller coaster, do I make myself clear, do I make myself clear, sit down, stop pooping,

01:17:53.260 --> 01:18:02.980
I don't have enough money for janitors yet, sit down, no do not puke, orange, don't puke,

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:13.100
sit down, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom,

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:19.860
you're sick, you're sicking yourself, do I need to put a toilet outside the thing, if I put a

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:29.500
toilet surely, if I put a toilet, and we can charge people for you to puke, right, ha let's get,

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:38.740
I'm a mechanic, let's get, I've only got, you better stop watering anything, but one guy,

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:43.940
we should hire a mechanic and just have him on table, fix ride inspector, yep that's all good

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:53.420
with me, or all good with me, entertainer, no, I'll get another handyman though, because

01:18:54.420 --> 01:19:04.220
we might need a few to walk the length of the park, don't you dare water the grass young man,

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:16.660
no way she said I'm a mechanic, entertainer, hardly even know her, come on guys please give me an

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.340
ounce of anything, when you come up with this hilarious, but if I repeat it, apparently it's

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:30.260
not funny anymore, I'm a handyman too, shiny, are you sad that the 3d0 omni is no longer available,

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:40.300
what is that one, is that the white one, the main one, what's the omni, POV veiler, get, end up

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.900
getting a house and then we can all share the KU100 together, that's probably the only way I'll

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:51.740
ever justify such an upgrade, I don't think I can utilize it properly, has a terrible fun,

01:19:51.740 --> 01:20:00.460
pun you should be ashamed of yourself, the one with four ears, ew, I never looked at the one with

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:11.140
four ears, did I open this, I did, wait, that's the ride, oh that is so cute, reeflings you have

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:16.540
to take me on this raid, I'd actually really want to do it, sorry but the smack kind of thing, I

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:21.260
want to look at all the flowers as they feel a little drive-by, a little fountain going on, that's

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:34.020
so cute, oh there's like giraffes, oh this is so cute, you have to do it, that KU100 me, all six

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:39.140
of us jumping here at the same time, could you handle the table, would take you on that raid,

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:47.140
it's so cute, look at all the tulips, oh look at the waterbees as well,

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:57.220
why are you okay, oh he's watching the big depper, big depper is really good value, big depper,

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.860
could that just say what I think I said, the park is really clean and tidy, okay I'm glad,

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:12.420
carrying a map, I think, yeah I think I said what I think I said, which I didn't expect, what are

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:19.060
you doing, oh you're looking at a map, well you did help these like reeflings, it's been a while

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:25.860
since I've had some relief so you know, get ready for Twitter, so when I've caught up on my work and

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:32.900
I don't feel stressed, let me go for it, oh the Ferris wheel to get a view of the beach is so pretty,

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.220
okay, are we making a profit, although I'm getting nervous,

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.740
is there only one of those,

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:55.540
everyone walking, no not everyone walking up to the Ferris wheel, only to walk away again,

01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:01.300
they're like no we're not in traffic, sorry, okay people actually seem to like the mehorse thing,

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:12.580
people are digging the Ferris wheel, get in, big wheel is good value, I want to get off big wheel,

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.820
you're in queue for it,

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:24.340
big wheel is really good value, big depper looks too intense, I'm not hungry, big wheel is good value,

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:27.860
how about no,

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:33.460
Galapurs was great, oh that must be the name of the other ride,

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.300
that ride low-key fire, I've never been on these before,

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.060
so in Scotland it's called The Shows,

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:54.580
oh the one big stretch, it's called The Shows, I mean the Shows are in town, it's like these

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:59.300
kind of rides that they build up, like obviously it's built from park, I mean every ride is built

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:04.900
from a park, but it gets like built up and dropped every other week, and I'm like too scared to

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:11.060
actually ever ride anything from The Shows, I don't know if the signs actually do anything,

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.820
what sign, this sign, this expansion,

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:22.900
maybe, your park has received an award for being the tidiest park,

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:34.260
oh thank you, thank you I did it all myself, wait they're taking pictures of the ride,

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.460
I don't even think about that,

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:42.660
like if you put up no interest signs, they do work, my son died on a roller coaster, oh no

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:49.700
Inspector Craig I'm so sorry, and oh my god that would be your story, your son died on a ride,

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:54.740
so then you vowed to become an inspector of parks, so that it would never happen to anyone

01:23:54.740 --> 01:24:00.420
else's son again, but it never, it doesn't matter how many rides you inspect and get

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.780
sorted out and people that you theoretically saved, it never fills the void of the emptiness that

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:15.380
your son left behind, so sad, that's honestly so sad, your park's so tidy, you're working your way

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:25.460
up to the safest park in the country, let's go, whoa that is so, the stuff writes itself,

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:33.860
no entry signs specifically do work because that's coded in option, I'm gonna fart so I need to mute

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.820
I did multiple farts in one, I like how I had to tab out in order to do that as well,

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:49.060
so just everything went silent, even the game went silent to hear my fart,

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:56.420
whoo, it's fucking Rekin, that's going straight up, that's going straight up my nostrils, fuck off,

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:03.060
it's fucking minging, what's wrong with me, what did I eat yesterday,

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:13.460
what did I eat, I can't even remember, oh I had, I ordered full for the first time,

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:19.540
but I don't, I don't know, I ordered chicken full and I don't think you're supposed to have

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:25.460
chicken, it's supposed to be beef and it was absolutely minging, I'm sorry but I don't know

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:30.980
if they completely messed it up and they were making fun of me or something because that was

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:35.540
absolutely Rekin, it was disgusting and everyone on TikTok makes it look like the most delicious

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:43.940
thing ever and I'm like ew, I found it rather vile, so yeah, betrayed by your own, perhaps death

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:50.580
by your own fart, damn it, I smell like popcorn over there, how dare you use my, my scriptures

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:57.060
against me, are we investing again something, junior roller coaster, okay that's what I need,

01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.420
I need to invest in more roller coasters and then I'll just hike the prices up,

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:05.860
do you like baked potatoes, I absolutely do them for their pog champs,

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:12.260
baked potato, I've actually been having shrimp with them because I'm trying to eat more fish

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:19.700
because apparently it helps with your longevity and I'm like hmm, okay fine, where are these,

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:25.220
see these guests are actually having to walk like a freaking mile just to get into the park,

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:34.100
but we'll definitely, when that roller coaster comes up, we'll definitely be saving and spending,

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:40.020
have you seen the potato with the beans and cheese, damn pot, I'm so sure I'll break this

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:45.620
too but I'm from Scotland and we do, we share a lot of culture with the rest of Britain, yes,

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:50.740
I've had beans and beans and cheese on a potato and it's good, it's lovely, I actually really

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:55.380
like it, I'd recommend it, if you ever, I'll tell you what, I'll make you,

01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.900
Tadius Park, my arse, whose vomit is that, come back and clean it up,

01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:06.660
why are we, why are we puking all of a sudden, what's going on,

01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:13.700
oh I'll make you, oh right, we've got the coaster, right, we've got the bag, we've got the bag,

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:19.220
give me that junior coaster, give me that junior coaster, what we looking at,

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:28.260
Nausea Raton is so high on the crazy caterpillar, I mean I can see why,

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.260
however the excitement's higher so, it's 9000,

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:42.580
I don't have enough for that, it's 9000,

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:49.700
wait, if I don't include scenery, does it make it cheaper,

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.540
no, I don't have the money for that, I'm getting trolled again, no,

01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:04.820
interest is super low, what should I just go to the bank, man I hate the bank,

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.580
gas and park, how did it go down, I don't know,

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:12.420
alone,

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:17.460
what,

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:23.780
did we say fuck it in my bowl,

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:28.340
right, junior coaster,

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.620
it takes up the whole park,

01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:42.660
who, I can't,

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:46.820
I can't even fit it,

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:57.540
I would have to move the merry go round, okay, see you you e-bam,

01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:05.700
how do I get rid of you, I build those the fuck out of you, clear that shit, can I sell it,

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:12.980
bin it, demolish, can't remove this, construction not possible while the game is paused,

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:21.860
okay, the people on the ride just gone forever, they'll never be seen again by their loved ones,

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.860
oh, I'm sure these people, yeah I'm pretty sure they could like walk back to where they're supposed

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:35.860
to go, right, you guys aren't like dumb enough that you can't see the big massive roller,

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:44.740
get off the tail, get off the tail, thank you, Jesus, we're playing musical tails over here,

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:58.020
what the, what are you doing, right, now we get the big FU one, okay, oh, sorry, I got a big say

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:11.540
there, that is so big, okay, okay pause, okay, okay, next, next, next, next, open,

01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:22.180
first take the motherfucking price up, then open, and then profit surely, oh my god,

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:27.940
look at them like ants, wait, why does no one want to go on the ride, is it too daunting,

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:35.060
look at these ants, wait, everyone's too scared of it, are you too scared, I need to go to the

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:44.020
toilet, oh, oh, okay, I guess, right, if you need to go to the toilet, right, everyone puke right

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:53.540
there, and everyone get a fizzy juice, open that up, open that up, and then we're gonna put down

01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:59.060
the benches, so no one puke, everyone sit down, and then we'll put the trash can, and then everyone's

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:09.700
gonna sit down, do you understand, sit down, do not puke all over my park, right okay, we're making

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:16.100
four dollars, do you still think it's good value, the crazy caterpillar is good value, oh yeah, that's

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:25.620
it, what about now, I want to go on something more thrilling than squeaky cycles, then guess what,

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:32.900
don't, smile, you want more exciting, what do you think of it, recent thought,

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:43.060
oh, you know, I've been queuing for our ages, well, I don't know what to tell you, it's really

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:49.860
good value, is it, thank you, thank you for your honest thoughts and opinions, why yes, of course,

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:55.540
what are you, I'm not hungry, this park is clean and tidy, Big Dipper looks too intense, okay, so

01:31:55.540 --> 01:32:01.780
you're not really bothered, that's fine, I already got the umbrella and a map, why would you buy an

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:10.580
umbrella if the day is clear, when the day is clear, I swear, go to the bathroom, you just walked

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:22.740
past one, do not puke on, oh, stop it, I feel sick, I'm not, I'm not paying that much to use the

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:28.500
toilets, this park's really clean and tidy, so because of your refusal to pay the price, you've

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:36.820
just muddied up my park and then complimented it on how clean it is, disgusting, Big Dipper was

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:45.220
great, it was really good value, oh yeah, was it, was it good value, okay, how about that,

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:53.860
peak telling me your thoughts, I am tired, we built a puke shed for you right there,

01:32:53.860 --> 01:33:00.580
it is a puke shed, that's such a good way to describe it, free bathrooms are easy ratings though,

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:04.100
are they, but they're making me so much profit,

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:15.860
what about you, is anyone, wait, everyone thinks that dollars too much, how dare you,

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:21.380
fine, I'll lower it to 50 cents, at least give me something for the bathrooms, don't puke,

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:31.700
hunger, oh my god, you're starving, I'm starving my park, yes, I'm so sorry, here, here's a chip,

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:39.780
right, everyone eat, yeah, eat right before the puke puddle, I'm sure it's really appetizing,

01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:47.460
those fees pay to keep the park clean, ungrateful, literally, what are they playing at, I'm supposed

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:54.900
to have like 800 guests, I'm, I'm getting nervous, okay, guests in park, I think the objective is like

01:33:55.860 --> 01:34:02.580
to have at least 750 guests in your park at the end of October on the second year,

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:08.260
right, my park ratings fine, but I assume you get more guests by having like more attractions,

01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:14.020
that just need to buy, that just need to go all out on loans, well maybe if they stopped

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:18.420
puke and they wouldn't be so hungry, literally, why aren't they thinking of, don't be selfish,

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:27.060
what are you, okay, you're hungry, but it's going down, so you're fine, just eat, are you squidding

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:38.180
me right now, Tim's too damn, I mean, if you want to get technical, Amy's done

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:49.460
that, oh advertising, why yes, of loan interest, on flu, company value, park values,

01:34:51.220 --> 01:35:03.140
so what, okay, I can't take that down, vouchers for free drink, why not, go,

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:11.780
369 guests, I can't believe it, they knew what was going on, right, what are we feeling now,

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:17.060
what's our body, I'm not paying that much to use toilet for, well they all cost the same,

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:24.900
so shut up and go for a job, toilet, you're gonna shit yourself, instead of pay five cents,

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:34.260
how about ten cents, you cheap bastard, you want to get off the big wheel, well good thing you're

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:40.660
not on it, no, no, no, we are not getting on this ride just to puke, you are not going past the

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:51.700
bathrooms, I feel sick, this path is disgusting, use the trash can, yes, right, sit down, stay seated,

01:35:52.660 --> 01:36:03.220
stay seated, do I make myself clear, stay seated, do not move, crazy caterpillar, star,

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:08.500
why does that get a star, what, you're gonna puke but you love the ride, I feel very sick, I need

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:15.460
to go to the toilet, I feel sick, okay, you just, a bumbly boot, why would you buy an umbrella,

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.740
I guess a star means, you can always drown them, don't forget,

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:27.300
then I'll get done for killing, wait, who destroyed the freaking benches, hello, hello,

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:36.100
benches can be destroyed, am I going crazy, I've never seen that before, do I need to like

01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:46.260
breathe make benches, is that security, you have no security, there's hooligans running a muck in my

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:57.780
park, you better sort them out, right now, that's right, five nights at Freddy's, is this where you

01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:04.580
want to be, I'm just gonna get it, why do you want to stay five nights at Freddy's,

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:10.980
Scottish version cover when, right now baby,

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.180
oh

01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:26.980
nice to meet you, ohayou gozaimasu,

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:31.780

I ain't gonna know Japanese and me, I'm Scottish, be nice, okay, what version is this, this is the

01:37:52.980 --> 01:38:04.100
deluxe version because it was gonna break, which is in Japanese, yeah, I am Japanese,

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:14.900
the best you're getting is a Hatsune Miku song from me, I'm so sorry, I'm thinking Miku,

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:22.500
Miku, health violation, restrooms deserve to be three, okay, and then why, what's going on with

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:29.460
my, oh I can just push the cursor to the edge of the screen to move the thing, right, in, in

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:35.060
memorial of Inspector Craig's son or Craig, I don't know how you say it, it's either Craig or Craig,

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:43.060
the toilets are now free, in the name of your son, I've been queuing for cycles for ages, what,

01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:47.620
am I supposed to tell them to hurry up, what, what do you want, can I tell them to hurry up,

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:52.980
maximum wait time, what does that mean, wait for a full load,

01:38:54.500 --> 01:39:00.180
wait for any load, just send them, what do you mean a full load, just freaking send them,

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:06.900
um, oh so you know Japanese, why yes of course I do,

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:25.700
stop, that's not funny, too many guests, not enough rides, okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you,

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:30.660
I hear you, oh I'm at my max lend amount,

01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:45.460
tell me, thank you Broly Living, Lollipop, Stroney would have been too powerful,

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:53.940
no she's gonna go, we need a water ride, okay, let's, let's analyze, I don't, I don't actually

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:58.820
think they've been, yeah it's making me, I need like pre-made stuff or it's not happening,

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:06.580
your marketing campaign for free drinks, but it did push up to 425 guests, I tell you what,

01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:12.740
this is a very low energy ride, but we will make a profit on it, okay,

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:18.740
so entrance, exit,

01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:31.300
and then we need the queuing one for the entrance, right, yes, oh my gosh, oh my, oh yeah Mr. Krabs

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:36.900
and then every, no not that one, draft, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:40.660
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, my baby don't mess around,

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.740
nope, just, just send them in, send them in, I couldn't hear,

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:56.420
and then number of rotations, that's fine, full load, any, I don't know, maybe a full load,

01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:05.700
I don't know, I don't know, I'm just, I mean, sounds like it's time for scrambled eggs one to appear,

01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:12.420
wait is that real, is that an actual ride's name though, there's a ferris wheel, no we already

01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:19.780
have one, marigold round, canoes round boats, custom design layout, custom, custom, custom, a canny,

01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:30.100
design, car ride, powered vehicle, road works, I sure hope it does, thank you, I'm sorry,

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:37.380
right, okay, we're gonna get one of those, give me a loan, thank you, okay, what was that just

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:44.740
looking at, was that a car ride, I was just looking at something,

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:58.020
one design available, wait, oh it's 5k, I can't afford it,

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.980
where is that thing I just looked at, miniature reel, wait, monorail,

01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:09.780
no, I've already got one of them, don't give me them, what, wait, I'm actually blind, it can't be

01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:18.500
monorail, custom design layout, miniature reel way, what, what was I just looking at, monorail,

01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:26.660
you are literally the embodiment of brain rot of the last 10 years, thank you,

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:31.700
I've never been more complimented on my life, you can even change the operation of some small

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:35.220
ride to have multiple of them, the queue is longer than the ride reel,

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:46.340
second row first column, car ride, right, no, I, right, let me,

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:54.580
excitement is both the same, intensity, sure, let's do this one,

01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:58.100
is this face in the wrong way,

01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:04.580
okay, wait, if it's, is this face in the wrong way, I think I'm, yeah,

01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.100
that wasn't it,

01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:19.700
I guess we'll do it like here, how do I connect this,

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.500
where do you touch the floor,

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:35.860
am I gonna have to build a ramp like a big girl, oh no, oh no, what have I done,

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:44.820
oh wait, it's there, honestly, right, first we need, right, okay,

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:52.020
so this is what, the waiting area, okay, so there's already a waiting area, that's the good news, build,

01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:02.660
okay, hold on, hold on, let me, okay, we just need to do a little bit, but okay,

01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:09.940
can you connect these two, okay, you're not quite getting it, you're not quite getting it,

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:14.260
but that's okay, we're gonna get there, you can't remove this, construction's not possible, we'll

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:22.180
pause, well, we just need to figure out a path, and surely this isn't going to be difficult,

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:29.300
okay, build a bridge, okay, jungle racers, that's the only way to be called that,

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:46.980
what do I need to do, how do, hi, we're just currently trying to figure out how to do passing

01:44:46.980 --> 01:45:01.300
in this game, no, no, but other way, like that way, yes,

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:13.460
confirm, no, okay, build it, okay, I mean, okay, okay, okay, go along, along, along,

01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:21.060
oh, all right, okay, okay, and then rotate, okay, and then we're gonna go this way,

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:32.020
okay, and then we're gonna connect it to the path, oh, we did it, oh my god, that took a little bit

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:36.340
too much IQ, I'm gonna be honest, let's get you up to like four dollars, since I have to take

01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:43.220
like an insane loan out on you, go, I don't need the safety checks, I just need you to go, okay,

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:50.180
and then we will put loads of benches, so everyone will sit down,

01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:57.140
everyone will sit down, do I make myself clear, he will sit down,

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:06.420
he will sit down, everyone sit down and puke into the trash cans,

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.900
pervaded on your walk back from the raid,

01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:15.860
let's just put some benches around for the people that need a little seat,

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:19.060
because you can't expect people to like walk the entire length of the park,

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:25.860
so that ferris wheel is bumping, god damn, we need a second one, right, we have now have a new raid,

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:34.180
the alun, oh, there's flowers, okay, water thoughts, people, water thoughts, recent thoughts,

01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:39.780
nothing, honestly me, real, true, oh no, my rollercoaster, autism has been enabled,

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:44.020
why are you going on so many raids, raids,

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:53.140
okay, what are you guys doing, tell me your thoughts, I want to go on something more thrilling,

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:58.740
I'm no thirsty though, right, that's good, do I need to put, no, because there's like literally

01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:02.100
food access right there, do I need to put a shitter off here, I don't know, maybe,

01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.540
when the music stops and gaming is really creepy, you're just,

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.660
you're in a room with me and nothing else, you don't need music,

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:20.740
actually I just don't hear any of the music,

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:26.980
I hear a bit of something,

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:35.780
I hear a bit, you've been invited to Inspector Craig's funeral,

01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:40.820
wait, no, what, why did he die, I have a mechanic,

01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:46.180
I have a mechanic, how did he die, boy, I had a heart attack,

01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:52.180
Inspector Craig's sore, sore, we had a heart attack,

01:47:52.980 --> 01:48:00.260
a rip craig, it's either Craig or Craig, it's Craig in the Scots mostly,

01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:06.820
F in the chats for Craig, rip craig, it was nice knowing your buddy,

01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:14.340
okay, let's see what you guys are saying, I'm not hungry, I've already got a park map,

01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:20.100
this park is good value, I want to go on something more, oh the maps are good value,

01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.820
thank you, thank you very much, I'll be here all day,

01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:31.060
imagine throwing up on a rollercoaster, the amount of days,

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:38.100
I've seen those horrible videos of someone vomiting and like the other people just accept

01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.060
their fate because there's nothing you can do, you're strapped in for the next minute,

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:48.100
I'm not hungry, are you actually not hungry or are you just saying that,

01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.340
oh no you're not, everything, oh you're happiness, you're not exactly ecstatic though,

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.580
not exactly ecstatic are you, well you are but you're thirsty, right, let's

01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:03.620
assume you're gonna go over, is everyone thirsty in this general area though,

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:08.500
oh they are, okay, I guess we'll get another drink thing, even though the drink thing is like

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:19.300
oh, can, will it, off the map, oh it does, same price there at the park, yeah, where is that

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.100
can I not charge more than,

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:30.900
nah it's just that word, how are you guys looking, you're not that happy,

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:38.180
what am I so miserable for, he put a star on, assume it if the star, it means it made the

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:46.180
guest ecstatic basically, right no one's vomiting, oh but he's hungry, okay, if you're too daft to

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:50.900
walk past the, like walk past all the, right fine, we'll just put toilets up here as well,

01:49:50.900 --> 01:50:00.020
oh right, we'll put a toilet up here because everyone's gonna be pooping and pant alone and

01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.540
right there, boom, you have everything you could possibly need right here

01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:13.060
and the toilets are free, you're welcome, at the expense of, at the expense of our, our overlord

01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:15.220
shareholders, the toilets are free

01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:23.540
is this roller coaster stall even making that much money, I even know where the entrance is, you know that

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:29.700
oh it's over here, okay, let me, let me just do a little cheeky rotation

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:40.580
make it six dollars for a war ball to add to the realism, well remember this is the, wait

01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:44.100
wait, it has a datatur,

01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:59.540
the man who made this, his autism was on fire, literally what, it has a freaking

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:05.300
velocity altitude vertical Gs,

01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:10.260
this man knew what he wanted,

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:15.860
he absolutely kicked, no wonder roller coaster type thing went far,

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:20.180
sorry but look at this, it's literally got a heart rate monitor,

01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:25.380
it's literally got a heart rate monitor, that's insanity,

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:34.100
look, the power of autism anything possible, look at that, boom, and he just, oh they flatlined,

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:40.900
oh, oh I'm sorry, right, I mean who wouldn't want to know the terminal velocity of each ride,

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:46.820
sure, wasn't there another amusement park singing, the one I played and just tortured people,

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:55.140
refunds are you okay, did I need to call someone, I mean trouble, right, we unlocked something,

01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:03.620
what was it, custom, custom, custom, custom, and then it went, it says this is 5K,

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.580
oh,

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:17.780
oh, I mean we could get it without any customization, but I feel like that's what people get excited

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:24.420
about, the scenery, I don't know, what was that steel thing,

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:36.020
steel chaperone, oh, ponytails, okay, is this too big for me, oh no, sorry I didn't need to build

01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:43.860
custom, I just wanted to see how big it was, oh we can actually fit it, okay, where's the entrance

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:50.500
here, yes, not enough cash, that's okay, okay, but we can't afford it, that's the good news,

01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:59.060
we're not allowed to have any more kind of money, you know, if you named the ride after

01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:03.780
yourself, we would all say we wrote Strongly True, I'll do it with an X and have that,

01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:09.220
I'll change the name to Strongly Broke Down, and before Strongly Broke Down, send maintenance,

01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:17.780
will you play Zutai-kun, the Nintendo DS game, absolutely, I'm obsessed with it, I will force

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:22.420
you guys to do the whole campaign mode with me, I love Zutai-kun, and once it's set up,

01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:25.700
you don't even have to do anything, like all the money just goes flying in,

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:34.660
I love me some Zutai-kun, right, well how much, we need 5K for the next steel thing, I feel sick,

01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:41.220
so sit down, stop puking everywhere, only have two genres,

01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:50.980
stop puking right in front of the third stalls, pick anywhere else, go up over path and pick

01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:58.260
anywhere else, sitting down after puking all over yourself, get out of here, sit down,

01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:03.300
everyone sit down, God you're like babies,

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:13.060
I believe I have to even do this, how are you guys looking, are you looking awful,

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:23.300
trying to like put it on the footpath but I'm not sure, it's not, okay, okay I see it,

01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:26.980
all right one more here as well, just for good luck,

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:31.300
Sony is really good value, Sony looks too intense for me,

01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:36.980
stop that's so good, I'll definitely be reading your mind, right what are you,

01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:41.620
the jungle racer with great right, but do you want to say it's good value or,

01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:49.780
are you gonna tell me, I'm not hungry or thirsty, no you're not, you're just walking past

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:56.740
literally the hunger and thirst, what are you doing, I'm like caterpillar was great,

01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:05.380
hungry thirsty, you need the toilets, you're fine, I need a few more benches, I think I might

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:09.620
actually need a few more benches, I don't want to make people walk for a long time because I'm

01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:19.700
like oh I get tired too, I'm so exhausted, stop puking at the front of my freaking thing,

01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:25.860
park is it that hard, Sony is too tame, invest in Sony, I've got 3000 right now,

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:38.500
we've got one, let's see what was it, it was a steel coaster, it was a steeple chase,

01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:46.660
Raiders horse ride shaped vehicles which run along a singular track and it's 40,

01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:54.420
4662, okay we're gonna stick it like somewhere here, I'm gonna have like a connection like

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:58.180
somewhere here and then if we want to expand we can maybe do boring stuff up this way,

01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:09.940
me when I walk 0.1 centimetre, honestly what have I started, you can open a list of other

01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:18.740
recent thoughts, okay we will do that one, give me $400 please, with a cherry on top,

01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:26.420
sibling relationship because they're like I bet, right where's the entrance, the entrance is like,

01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:28.660
oh god this is really awkward,

01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:34.420
isn't that gonna destroy the bridge,

01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:41.780
this, or is it, no, hmm,

01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:46.180
maybe it'd be better if it was actually over here,

01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:50.740
is there a room,

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:55.380
is there a room,

01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:00.260
she keeps on under us to be in us, real,

01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:11.540
is there a room, hold on sorry, I need to check if this is skinny enough, I'm gonna see,

01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:22.980
what, wait sorry I'm trying to, I need to think of where the entrance is gonna go,

01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:31.220
I think that's the best I can do, all things considered, right pause first and then we can

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.980
deal with whatever terrible mapping we need to do,

01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:53.460
I actually can't even tell what I'm looking at, I said it's closed, right so I need to

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:58.900
connect these two platforms, okay we have an objective, we have an objective, right a bridge,

01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:03.460
shit, don't do that, don't do that again, okay,

02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:15.140
nope, nice try but, pull again, what,

02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:21.380
what,

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:32.180
no, this one, yeah well that'll do, that'll do, I mean, no stop doing that pathway,

02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:35.380
isn't that the waiting pathway,

02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:45.940
oh, we have to go up, oh man we gotta go bold,

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:51.140
wait go back one, yeah do that, wait hold on, go and then go up,

02:00:53.620 --> 02:01:00.020
yeah no you're supposed to connect to the pathway, oh man, oh man,

02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:10.820
go that, right, I mean is it still like that, hold on, let me, let me just, let me just,

02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:14.740
why is this, right click to remove, no,

02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:24.900
yes, okay, but don't give me that path, give me this path and then go up and then go flat,

02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:31.620
oh my god, right okay, okay but hold on, hold on, let me get up, let me get up,

02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:37.140
I just need to fix this one over here because that's wrong and then,

02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:48.420
okay, okay, okay, okay that, we did it, we did it, we have a new ride, we have a new ride,

02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:52.180
it just took us a hot second but we did it, that's the main thing right, let's hike the price up as

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:58.260
we always do and then open it, no we don't need to test it, I have full faith that everything

02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:04.580
will go fine, smile and then play and then hopefully that spreads out more guests

02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:11.300
and then things won't be so overwhelming for like the other rides as well,

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:21.140
let's just put the trash can here, let's put loads of benches because we're starting to expand

02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:30.580
that thing, what is the ride, I need to call it strong, where do I lean in at, oh it's all green as well

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:36.260
hey there we go, you guys ready to ride this one,

02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:49.140
oh my god it actually changes the thing here, you can raid me, we did it after two hours,

02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:59.700
you can raid me, we did it, we did it, it only took me two hours, that was a lot of work to

02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:14.100
get there but we did it, where's the lane, new attraction, a burger bar, so now we offer burger

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:27.460
yeah just put on top of the ride that thing, is the game trolling right now,

02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:32.500
I thought it was like all adjusted to the pathway but I guess not, sure why not shove a burger joint

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:41.300
like right there, we'll take up the craze as always do, okay we have 500 guests, what is our

02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:50.740
timeline, I think we're almost there, guests in park 500 right and it keeps going off every month

02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:55.460
so we're doing fine, I just don't know about the free attraction, that's okay,

02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:01.220
have at least 750 by October year two, we're not even in year two, wait are we going to be

02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:09.700
hanging about waiting for this map to finish, that's right make me money, why yes of course

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:17.460
everyone makes me money, look at all those green things, I've become the big differ broke down,

02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:26.660
I hope I have an account, I do, okay he's been called in, okay September, we're in September right

02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:32.740
we're definitely gonna be moving faster, I don't even know if we have him, we rode you in the last

02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:43.540
audio, don't get greedy real, I do too, the big differ's still broken after years, wait where is

02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:50.420
he, what are you doing, what is the big differ anyway, that's the caterpillar,

02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:57.620
oh that's the big differ, where is he, is he just like not in the park, go to your fucking door

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:06.100
he was glitched out that time, is that what this is, if they're not like on the ground

02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:14.100
okay the park's definitely losing the cleanliness awardee, joking with all the vomit

02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:27.860
but we still don't have all the guests though, okay hold on, what's the cheapest raid we have,

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:34.100
probably what the big differ, sure let's just do everything,

02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:43.380
advertise campaign of the park, go for it, just send them all in okay, for a particular raid,

02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:51.140
do the scrawny, advertise scrawny, go go go go, let's get like 750 guests in here, okay and then

02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:59.300
we're gonna zoom, we're zooming, we're zooming, security guard is walking, he's walking, I think

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:06.580
we're gonna have to buy more janners, so the guests are at 300 though, hey sorry 650 guests,

02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:12.580
he's going up, I believe in you, Mary go around can never go wrong, oh we've unlocked dojooms, okay

02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:21.300
dojooms, what are dojooms, are they a wee raid, gentle raid, no dojooms you're getting bashed

02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:28.820
about, it can't be a gentle raid, which perhaps this is, perhaps the dojooms are the ones we made

02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:39.540
along the way, D for dojooms, oh found them, what, oh my god yes, um where do we fit it,

02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:43.780
oh we can fit it over here really easily, let's do that, there's Rick

02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:55.140
where is the entrance, I really, okay that my only thing was be, I wish you could pause to like

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:59.860
catch off a little bit, yeah entrance, you made the entrance, okay there we go

02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:09.860
and then exit here and then guests are complaining about the disgusting state of your park,

02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:16.020
check where your handyman are, okay well give me a second I'm trying to expand, I can't do this

02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:24.900
all at once, stop this madden, yeah do it like that so we actually have some time in case it gets

02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:36.420
really popular please, do that and then we can open dojooms but first we must take the price up,

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:47.060
open, okay okay we did it right, disgusting state of park, okay let's get a few more of you around,

02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:55.140
uh who's disgusting, who's causing the disgust, is it this right over here, be honest,

02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:05.780
where's the puke, this is just puke finder simulator, where are you guys puking over here be honest,

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:12.980
no, oh there's a janitor that's maybe just, oh my game just crashed there, oh here it is, okay how

02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:24.020
about you go I don't know and no do not do gardening I will cry, handyman, okay cleaning up,

02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:30.180
cleaning up, why are we puking over here, what's going on, why is there litter, I have, I have

02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:40.020
fine well hire another one, hey you guys are, you suck, I do so much for you, this is why the

02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:46.260
shareholders are so fucked, we worked so hard, right bins, clearly we need more bins, I don't know

02:08:46.260 --> 02:09:02.820
how but sure more bins, more benches, your marketing campaign has ended, disgusting litter bugs everywhere,

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:09.700
there's literally a bin there, where inspector create, he passed away unfortunately, I think I

02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:19.060
might buy the lord, your advertising campaign for scrawny has finished, whoa this is bad, I've

02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:24.180
been queuing for scrawny for ages, right well she's trying her best, damn she can't fucking serve

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:30.180
everyone at once, it's a single, it's a single use rate for a reason, single one at a time rate for

02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:36.820
a reason, not single use, that's not how any of that works, one at a time for a reason, be nice,

02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:44.820
right I think what we'll do is we'll invest in the lower excitement things because I think

02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:54.580
they'll increase the overall like people in the park, unless I'm just making that up but I feel like

02:09:54.740 --> 02:10:05.540
I don't think I can fit a water, I don't think I could fit though,

02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:13.220
no there's no way I can fit it, that's okay though, I tried,

02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:20.740
and I'm not demolishing that roller coaster, keep investing on scrawny, real true,

02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:26.500
I'll know if you keep investing in everyone else and deal with you,

02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:34.900
alright I can't, I can only really do the wee rides now,

02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:42.340
right we'll put down the wee rides because I think it will increase overall park attendees,

02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:47.060
you know, and it's just like a small thing that doesn't really,

02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:54.340
it doesn't exactly cost like a lot to have or anything like that so I'm quite,

02:10:54.900 --> 02:11:02.340
because I just hear someone hear, I might have, it's very possible, right build a wee thing,

02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:07.700
okay and then turn it on,

02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:14.420
but first take the price off, I did it the wrong way but fine, just take it off a little bit,

02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:22.580
get new attraction open, go go go, thank you Broly legend for the super jet,

02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:25.780
crazy glitches, you sound to me, time to make a custom coaster,

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:32.740
I can't bring myself to do it, I can't, I'm too scared, stop this madness please,

02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:41.300
what do you want from me, what is another born ride, a gentle ride, a merry go round,

02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:48.820
do they have one, dodgums, strawnee, whatever that was, a little spinny thing,

02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:55.060
god that one is making some fat, like I can see all them little pixels moving, I don't remember you

02:11:55.060 --> 02:12:03.700
but we've got a ferris wheel round, a merry go round, okay I've got a merry go round and a ferris,

02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:10.260
I've got a ferris wheel, not a merry go round, oh my gosh, a huge respect for your most recent

02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:16.900
twitter short, did you enjoy it, I like showing the behind the scenes, I don't mind it, I've got a

02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:21.140
few questions I'm probably gonna develop, someone was like how much is that in like youtube premium

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:26.980
and I was like well because I do ASMR my youtube premium is a bit not this, can you move over a

02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:37.060
bit, my youtube premium will be different from others because I do ASMR specifically and yeah,

02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:41.540
I don't talk about the behind the scenes but I don't know if people are like you're fucking

02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:46.180
I don't really want to put anything like

02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:55.940
just like put onto, that is ridiculous, can I just do that, that's silly, don't be so silly,

02:12:55.940 --> 02:13:05.060
you're making me giggle, you're making me have a giggle, the silliness, twisters broken down

02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:16.900
that's it, let's put that off a wee bit, it's just a nice calm gentle raid and then overall

02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:25.540
hopefully it'll help have more people at least give me a bit of a chance to open it up please

02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:31.300
before you all start paling in, right so that's two relaxing raids across from each other

02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:37.540
and literally it's up to people, whoever what they want to go on that's fine, doesn't stop me,

02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:43.540
doesn't stop them, thank you all for your voice because it's super chat but I'm

02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:47.620
glad you like it, the park is designed to test your space management, well it's

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:52.420
bloody working, I'm already ran out of space, I probably should have shoved this like way in

02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:57.300
the back corner possibly, I don't know maybe we can get like some sort of skinny roller coaster

02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:04.820
next, I don't know what the game is investing in, it's just investing in everything

02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:18.500
right, scenery and theming, no, shops and stalls, no, water rides, transport rides,

02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:31.380
I enjoyed it very much, was a very brave piece of content, your transparency and business savvy

02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:40.100
is inspiring, um people were surprised and I'm like she you thought I wasn't going to be a success

02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:47.780
that sounds so arrogant please please I'm actually cringing at that, what I meant to say was

02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:55.860
I didn't have doubts, I wouldn't have invested if I had any doubt about like anything I wouldn't

02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:04.340
have invested, simple as like there was failure is not an option, it literally, it cannot happen

02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:11.700
and I mean it didn't so, thank you again for the uh super chat of the voice, I call you

02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:18.180
Otter voice a second ago, I think I did sorry for the tea, dim posters crushed, is there no ride

02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:31.220
improvement research, um I guess not, I never saw anything like that, um it just says, who goes

02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:42.660
transport, gentle roller and thrill, I'm how much, research has taken 200, marketing is 200,

02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:49.060
staff wages 1.3, food and drink, I'm not making a profit on food and drink,

02:15:49.620 --> 02:16:03.060
oh to stock it, but sales are top, ticket rides are off, landscaping,

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:10.900
no, no worries people are always under, it's not happy, eight of time belch, your dedication is

02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:17.460
abnormal, oh thank you, you're not, it's not the arrogant, you're confident, it's a good thing,

02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:23.380
then but also I'm making strongly the best, a failure isn't an option, how am I here, you're

02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:29.700
not a failure, don't talk about yourself like that you silly goober, if you say stuff like I'm

02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:33.700
right hold on a minute, hold on I'm gonna put my tin foil hat on because it's not even a tin foil

02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:38.980
foil hat, if you talk to yourself like that you will start believing in your, you'll start to

02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:45.540
believe it okay, so you know how it's like fake it until you make it, if you're nasty to yourself

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:49.620
you're not gonna have a good time, you need to be nice to yourself, I'm actually being serious as

02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:55.940
well, like you have to say to yourself like I can like it's called positive affirmation, please

02:16:55.940 --> 02:17:00.980
do not puke, sit down, oh my god sit down, don't puke, I know it's called positive affirmations,

02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:04.500
either you believe it or you don't, but I'm not being funny, if you're poisoning yourself with

02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:10.900
the same poison every single day, you're gonna be poisoned you know, but if you

02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:18.180
do meme about and you know, say like oh you know what actually I'm a bit of a decent person or

02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:22.740
like I do try my best, just because like you've done bad shit in the past, it doesn't mean you're

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:26.820
unredeemable or some shit, like what the fuck, literally every, think of every video game you've

02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:31.140
ever, right get that price of the umbrellas up right now, hold on a minute, hold on a minute,

02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:35.300
and wait why do I have two kiosks right next to each other, same price, same price, get them

02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:42.340
umbrellas up, 350s, unethical, but true, you were most likely taught to hate yourself along the

02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:47.540
way, literally think of high school, there's this thing called like, I think it's like the

02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:54.340
blooming flower theory or something like that, and it's like if you dare to be slightly different

02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:58.420
then the status quo, you get picked on, you get bullied, you get this, you get that,

02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:06.180
no more, no more, literally no more, like I get to be my weird self, you guys accept me,

02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:14.020
and I hope I extend that love and that belonging towards you, of like yeah you've got brain worms,

02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:18.980
okay, I'm not gonna hate you for it, that's just how it is, so let's see what we can do,

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:24.900
let's have fun, you know, let's give each other purpose if we can, or a sense of community,

02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:29.860
a sense of belonging, because like, you know, you're really harsh to yourself, I wish you weren't

02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:36.500
as harsh to yourself, and maybe over time I can teach you, you know, to be nicer, kinder to

02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:41.380
yourself, I really like the neon color difference in the puke, that's really nice, I like the neon

02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:48.260
shade too, preach it strongly, took me years to learn, is that my eyeball, oh it is my eyeball,

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:54.740
it's not my eyeball, you take my eye, honestly I go through the phrase, don't be sorry, be better,

02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:00.900
don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness, real, real, me when I come online and I'm like,

02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:11.380
the girls said what, how do you know about my brain worms, who told you, everyone has brain

02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:17.620
worms, hell even I have brain worms, but I don't know, because I've just been allowed to do my thing

02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:23.700
and be myself and just meme about, I don't really get, I'm like, I don't, I've said this before,

02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:28.740
I don't experience like, imposter syndrome, I don't really have any of that, I don't know,

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:39.380
it's kind of hard to, I don't mean to, what's the word, sympathize and empathize, sympathize is

02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:43.620
when you haven't had it yourself, it's not that it's hard to sympathize, because I just, I'm just like,

02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:49.460
so obviously I've just kind of preached about being nice to yourself, but because I know my

02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:53.940
limitations when it comes to content, I will never produce anything that's 100 out of 100,

02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:57.460
you know what I mean, like I'll never get a score like that, so what's the point of like holding

02:19:57.460 --> 02:20:03.620
myself up to that, like I mean, fuck, I'm literally on a game that is what, two decades old, I couldn't

02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:09.700
even learn how to do the paths at the start, am I gonna say it myself, oh, oh, I should have done

02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:14.740
this, I should have done that, no, I'm gonna giggle at myself and be like, haha, I didn't even know

02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:21.940
how to do paths at the start of this game, like, you know, you will judge yourself more harshly

02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:29.060
than anyone could ever look upon you, okay, and keep that in your mind, because it will, it could

02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:34.820
swoop in and save you from just spiraling, you will only judge yourself as harsh, I mean, what's

02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:40.180
that Emmy mean, where it's literally like, you're too afraid to be perceived that you cannot enjoy

02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:45.300
life, like, or something, yeah, you're too afraid to be perceived by others, that you can't enjoy

02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:50.500
your life, and it's like, come on, you only have one chance, oh my god, they're all puking into the

02:20:50.500 --> 02:21:02.980
bucket, it's working, like, enjoy what you enjoy, sorry, but everyone puking into the bucket,

02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:07.140
buckets for everyone, everyone puked, I didn't realize they actually picked up the bin and puked

02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:12.100
in it, I love it here, stream can't be lower than 10 of the person's streamers attempt, how dare you,

02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:20.660
and get kissed, get loved on, how dare you, sympathizing is feeling bad for someone else,

02:21:20.660 --> 02:21:25.220
is mis- empathizing, put yourself in, I thought you could only do empathy if you had gone through

02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:31.380
it yourself, oops, what's that, my English, my terrible English is coming back to haunt me,

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:37.140
and also, hey, I was lurking but broke it because you've got points, still suffering from

02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:40.420
in real life responsibilities, so honestly, it's really good to see you in front of your hand,

02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:49.540
you'll be a busy bee, yeah, a busy bee, yeah, let it be nicer to yourself, and you can only,

02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:54.340
only you can practice it, now you may be listening, you're like, yeah, yeah, strong, you're, you're,

02:21:54.340 --> 02:22:00.100
you're, you're a strong slash, and that's true, just maybe be a bit nicer and just be like, oh,

02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:04.580
you know what, maybe I will have a good day, smile, maybe I will enjoy myself today,

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:10.660
smile, where are you, what are you doing, oh, he's got a drink in his hand, you better not let her,

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:18.900
later bug, oh no, that's not what this song, it just occurred to me that the song that goes,

02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:23.780
wait, is this song, let her bug, no, it can't be, let her bug,

02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:31.940
you gotta go, boom, boom, into my heart, I do want you, guys be nice,

02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:36.660
Englishes are setting language, Scots are the first, real and true, thank you British government for

02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:42.020
recognizing that Scottish slang is a different lingo, I will read you guys a book, that's actually

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:45.140
Scottish slang, you know, love it, you guys will be like, what did I just read, and I'll be like,

02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:51.620
hehehe, you're going to educate me, believe in yourself, and don't deny happiness to yourself,

02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:55.620
find happiness wherever you can, love and happiness can be found in the smallest of places,

02:22:57.140 --> 02:23:00.660
hold on a minute, I'm pulling up the quote, I'm pulling up the quote,

02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:06.580
I'm pulling up the quote, I'm pulling it up, I can't remember off the top of my head,

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.740
okay, you ready for this, okay, the quote is coming,

02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:18.900
and check her bug, you put the boom, boom, into my heart, wake me up,

02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:24.580
instead of great positivity or great negativity, I have great and different, hey look,

02:23:24.580 --> 02:23:29.780
sometimes it's better to just be like, yep, this is life, than to be like, oh shoot, this is life,

02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:38.740
you know, you know what I'm saying, right, time for the quote, some believe it is only great power

02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:46.180
that can hold evil and check, but that, hold on a minute, it's on the wrong screen,

02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:53.220
but that is not what I have found, it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that

02:23:53.220 --> 02:24:01.460
keep the darkness at bay, small acts of kindness and life, that's the quote, I want you to remember

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:07.460
that, and no, I know Saruman isn't coming to killers or something like evil like that, I know,

02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:13.300
but I think there's a lot of truth to it, it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk,

02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:19.140
like me and you little reefling, okay, have you killed anyone yet, no, I'm trying to be wholesome

02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:31.860
right now, are you serious, yeah, what Anonymous, what are you saying to us, Saruman, the stinky,

02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:35.780
please, I love that meme so much, Anonymous, what are you saying to us, you say, hi strongy,

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:44.740
I'm honestly kind of jealous of you and the rest of you, I've always wanted to entertain others

02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:48.740
and you six have found the courage to step up and do what I've wanted to do since I was a kid,

02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:53.700
maybe I'll shake off the rust and get back to my roots, I heavily encourage you to do so,

02:24:53.700 --> 02:25:00.740
when I say the term, you only live once, what I don't want, why the fuck is there a banana on

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:08.020
the top of the chip shop, oh it's a chip, sorry, bit distracted, when I say you only live once,

02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:13.700
what I don't mean behind that sentence is, oh my god, you must achieve absolutely everything

02:25:13.700 --> 02:25:21.860
you possibly could have ever wanted to do in this lifetime, no, what I mean by you only live once is

02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:28.740
give it a shot, give it a shot, I don't know if you've heard the theory that 80% of the work

02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:38.260
is done by showing up and doing it and going for it, but that is very true and very real,

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:45.220
I say go for it because what's the harm, oh no, right so what's the downside of giving

02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:52.180
giving it a shot, oh I might not find success, okay but what's the good things, you got to

02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:58.340
explore a hobby that you're passionate about, you got to expand upon your creativity of you

02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:07.060
yourself that I've done, another benefit, you might find success, so if you're trying

02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:12.020
to sell me on the down points of not pursuing your hobby, you're preaching to the wrong choir

02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:17.860
because this choir over here is singing like something else, I don't know what song we're singing,

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:23.540
okay I'm just a memer, that's what song we're singing and I'm just a memer,

02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:31.540
you know, it operates on the same logic, if you write down your problem, you're halfway through

02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:39.620
solving them, yeah that kind of stuff, okay, you only get one shot, shoot, shoot the whoop, oh yeah,

02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:45.780
yeah, banana, it's a banana, please tell me that looks like a banana, not a chip,

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:57.060
you miss every shot you don't take, my friend who misses archery, 50% of it, for real, if you're

02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:01.540
so worried just to dress up, makes you think it'll fall off and then go for it, literally send it,

02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:10.100
send it, send it, people wearing it, reflins are wearing it, like you spent 60,000 US dollars

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:16.500
to starve an agency, do you think I was sitting like stressed and over, send it,

02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:27.140
send it, just go for it, don't hold yourself back, don't be the reason you hold yourself back,

02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:35.540
darling, go for it, well to be fair you were very stressed out, oh well now I'm not stressed

02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:41.380
out anymore because the girls are doing their thing, right, we're gonna zoom ahead because I

02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:46.980
would've achieved what we need to achieve, oh my god, look at all that sea of green, oh, a wooden

02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:51.460
wail-the-mouse, get me on that, what is it, new raid attraction, wooden wail-the-mouse,

02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:59.300
a wooden wail-so you're saying I have a shop in my-clam, yeah,

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:08.020
you didn't hear that, you didn't, for a legal reason, what, excitement right into the castello

02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:17.460
is insane, hello, oh my god we can fit it, oh my god we feel like you're gonna fit,

02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:23.380
no, you're gonna slot right in right there, yeah, you're gonna slot right in for me,

02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:27.860
why is it not,

02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:41.700
oh, that's the entrance there,

02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:50.580
oh, let's do the path here, oh I didn't need to do that, but we did it,

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:56.820
okay, and then then we need to open the raid, but first take the price up,

02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:03.940
who goes there, five dollars, I know it's a lot but the excitement is like insane on this ride,

02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:11.300
I'm not even kidding, I can't text, all I hear is strawberries just screaming,

02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:18.580
the house is right behind, well hey you will look fun, oh my, I never even thought about that to be

02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:25.700
considerate, could you imagine every day all you hear is,

02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:37.060
do not invade anyone, did you hear the big Scottish drama, I'm about to clue you in the

02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:45.140
Scotland drama, so you know how there's Nessie, the Loch Ness monster, right, so she is like moaning

02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:56.580
or screaming at me, so Loch Lomond is where Nessie lives, right, the aquatic, whatever you want to

02:29:56.580 --> 02:30:05.140
call her, and basically why are none of you going on the ride, okay, I've spent how much on that ride

02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:13.780
and none of you are going for it, and the drama is someone is trying to purchase Loch Lomond to

02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:22.660
open up a theme park on it, and everyone's like, it's literally a conservation area for, not reservation,

02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:28.020
sorry, a conservation for nature area thing, you know what I mean, that's what you're gonna,

02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:33.620
that's what your neighbours are gonna hear, no that's what the convention staff are gonna hear, amen,

02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:38.660
can I get an amen, stop, stop, right Broly legend, thank you for this super chat,

02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:46.420
um so since you're a cutlery, so you get along with Nessie, obviously we're both aquatic and we

02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:54.580
love you, basically it was Johnny with her legs at the war, oh my god you've got me, you've got me, amen,

02:30:56.980 --> 02:31:01.700
what is, um okay can I tell you one of the dumbest streams I wanted to do,

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:11.700
but I don't think I can, so I have been watching black churches on TV right, and it's so fun and

02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:17.700
energetic and I love it, and they all have a keyboard in the background, okay, so I wanted to do a

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:25.220
confession stream, but it was like we were singing Jesus songs as well, that was going to be the

02:31:25.220 --> 02:31:29.940
stream idea, but I don't know if that's really dumb and I shouldn't speak ever again, god everyone

02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:37.300
is lining up for this new, where are you all, you're all hiding like moments ago, I'm probably

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:44.100
gonna need to add more toilets now I think, I would definitely add a shitter, okay there we go,

02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:52.660
we've got a shitter, open it up, a wreath stream, a wreath slay, that and oh and oh and oh, wait

02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:59.540
what's the name, August, confession stream sex on unspronied, do it you only live one, well

02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:03.620
literally like I was gonna get you guys to confess and then we'd all have a giggle over it, a little

02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:12.180
giggle, and then I was gonna like sing a song in between it, like I know that sounds so silly,

02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:15.860
but like I thought that was the best idea ever and I was like wait a minute, someone gonna be

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:25.460
weird and be like oh you're making fun of this and I'm like no motherfucker, you're order, right

02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:35.540
that's a drink, so now we'll do an ice cream, ice cream for ice cream, an ice cream for your...

02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:44.820
I'm gonna be honest, if you heard me verbally smack my mouth, it's because I'm not paying attention

02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:52.100
to what I'm saying and it just comes out, okay it just comes out, it just comes out,

02:32:52.820 --> 02:33:00.740
I literally, I'm just bichining, and my brain just goes for it, she's putting the ice cream

02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:05.780
next to the toilet, oh my god do you guys remember two girls one cup,

02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:12.340
and then the big debate was like it's ice cream,

02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:23.460
I remember the debate was like ice cream, why must you remind me, no, wasn't that, wait were you

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:29.140
guys not like the debate of it, it was literally like okay I'm gonna have to hire another mechanic,

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:37.700
okay answering a radio call, okay I think we maybe need a second mechanic, I don't know how to

02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:44.260
see it but wait what broke down, who or what isn't moving, we're not, I don't know,

02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:50.980
and I'll just let him do the rounds, ice cream argument was just copied on, oh was it,

02:33:51.460 --> 02:34:02.500
what debate, it was ice cream, the company that made it admitted to it, oh

02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:07.860
I've never seen the argument and now that I'm picturing it I don't want to, I'm sorry,

02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:12.660
I don't remember the debate but I remember that, cease okay right I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop,

02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:20.580
right we've almost finished the park, I am gonna update Azura and mine Patreon when I get off,

02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:25.140
I know I said I was gonna do it yesterday, I'm so sorry, I'm behind everywhere but the girls

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:27.860
are being so patient and fantastic with me so please don't worry,

02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:40.340
I just read that comment in chat, I shouldn't have started, anyway, oh look how many reeflings

02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:48.660
want to ride strong, let's go, 86 of you are lining, 87 are lining up right now to raid me

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:57.380
and you're paying me, can I add more cars, if I add more cars, is someone, oh there's only five

02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:07.700
talk about exclusivity, that's that big train, guys she's behind me,

02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:16.020
but why is everyone digging this ferris wheel, is it because it has a view, what's the music for

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:32.740
the ferris wheel, modern, I can hear hints of something, one coaster for each girl when,

02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:44.020
honestly my mind is here, really squeaky, reliability down time 6%, that's fine,

02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:55.940
minimum wait time so far, rock, no rock doesn't make sense for such a gentle thing,

02:35:55.940 --> 02:35:59.860
let's not do that, what are you thinking, recent thoughts, no thoughts, real, true,

02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:10.900
queuing for strone, right, how do I read action thoughts, I feel sick, I'm running out of cash,

02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:17.940
I'm not hungry, I feel sick, I've been queuing for strone, this path is disgusting,

02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:24.180
this park is really clean and tidy, so we've got a few contradicting things, that's like a stop us,

02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:32.660
can't stop us with our order, okay you guys are actually using the bin, a Christmas miracle,

02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:40.100
truly a Christmas miracle, right I think we're gonna need a lot more seats for how many people

02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:45.940
we have, maybe a few more in the pathway and stuff, I don't want people to be like exhausted,

02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:53.700
are you squinting me right now, what, in the vomit park, straight up rioting it,

02:36:53.700 --> 02:37:01.060
and by it, haha well, let's just say, strone, thank you for the tip and honest, actually that

02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:06.820
just reminded me, in my most recent short, Arisa has like full control of the shorts that she makes

02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:13.540
for me, if you pause my most recent short, it literally, she put that copy pasta in it,

02:37:13.540 --> 02:37:21.700
because she's heard me say it, and I'm like Arisa, but it was so funny, it's just that and by it,

02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:27.860
I mean my pimpus, like Arisa, I wasn't gonna see that for the first time and be like what, wild,

02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:35.780
okay I think it's safe to say that we have, actually we could probably pay a bit of our debt,

02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:43.540
go, yeah okay, and then we just skip ahead, because we're done, oh look at that sea of green,

02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:49.860
oh aren't you getting that serotonin, oh wait there's a ghost train attraction, hold on pause, pause,

02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:56.660
ghost train, oh we've got a pirate ship, I didn't even know we had that,

02:37:56.980 --> 02:38:06.900
what's a pirate, a what, power monster shaped cars travel 3000,

02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:10.980
hold on give me the loan back, give me a bag, give me a bag, give me a bag, give me my money,

02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:18.580
ghost train surely it's not going to be too big that it won't fit, surely,

02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:33.860
I'll take it, I'll take it, I can't see, I can't see how skinny the path is, well I'll take it,

02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:42.420
right okay first, open, next, hike up the price, buy a lot because the prices are starting to match

02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:52.260
each other, and then the path, let's, let's add it, I can't see anything right now, I think I did it,

02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:57.620
okay, now this ride is getting completely ignored because of its unfortunate location,

02:38:57.620 --> 02:39:02.180
like I literally cannot see it, but we'll just do the classic bins and benches outside,

02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:12.260
and then we're gonna rotate again, okay one person's gone up that path, oh there's a big

02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:29.380
scary boy on top, you're queuing for it, why, the thing should be on, are they actually doing

02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:36.340
a test run, I can't believe it, that's Mr Bone, the ride never ends, is it actually Mr Bone,

02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:43.220
make a bank, yes I trained that ends with the wall, the ghost is after, is you after the ride,

02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:51.460
this is a reference, like clearly do not know, right okay now we can speed it up because we've

02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:58.580
done what the game asks, it said 750 guests and we're at 875, so I think we're okay,

02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:06.500
Park rate in 945, not bad, it must be the vomit that's doing it, I can't believe it,

02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:13.300
the vomit's letting us down, shocking, if everyone could kindly stop, you're a king,

02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:22.340
I've just noticed the people that are sitting don't come out of the animation,

02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:29.460
0 out of 10 game, unplayable, unplayable, absolutely shocking,

02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:35.140
slide is broken down, well I have two mechanics so surely one of them's getting on it,

02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:42.580
surely, big dipper is broken down, can everything relax please, please everything

02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:52.420

02:41:03.860 --> 02:41:11.860
Cheshire you're too big, I can't have them,

02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:20.420
we're all mad here Alice, I can't have them, he's too big, smell,

02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:26.180

02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:40.260
wait what did I say, what did I say, her once, I wouldn't, attention, hey,

02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:48.100
everything's breaking, oh no it's because we're doing months apart right, September, October,

02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:53.540
so we're about to get the screen that says congrats you won surely, I've probably done something wrong

02:41:53.540 --> 02:42:01.460
but yay, they did re-publish this game, still hasn't been fixed,

02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:12.260
well they better hurry up, where are you going, responding to crazy cat pillar,

02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:21.700
where are you, he's on it right, it's fine he's on it, he's on it like a car bonnet, right let's pay our

02:42:21.700 --> 02:42:30.100
debts and then I guess we'll just go, twister is broken down, oh no I might actually need another

02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:36.340
mechanic, I can't believe it, have you tried open rcp too, I haven't, I have no idea what that is,

02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:40.580
you did it, I didn't know you could win at this game, oh you get like a mission objective,

02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:44.180
just got here, I'm listening at work right now, sorry if I don't interact, no don't worry don't

02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:48.180
how is it not being fixed, is he glitching out or something,

02:42:52.580 --> 02:43:01.220
are Virginia real, are Virginia real, we're just going to have another mechanic down because I

02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:07.220
don't know what is going on, all of a sudden everything's breaking down, right what is that,

02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:15.540
look everything's breaking down, I think maybe when I speed up they're not, breakdown breakdown

02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:23.700
breakdown, whole park's bloody shot, right what's that Virginia wheel,

02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:32.340
what's wrong with me, a Virginia wheel sorry, the whole park is breaking down by not giving

02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:39.780
me, don't believe her lies, Virginia is a silo, what it's not real state,

02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:50.980
a Texas tube, oh well I like it, can I get away with it here, why not,

02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:58.740
crazy caterpillars in the way, how big are you, seriously you're so, oh it is in the way,

02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:04.260
I can shove it all the way in the corner,

02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:14.580
oh I don't have the money, give me the money, we're going to shove it all the way in the corner,

02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:19.620
okay then we need to do the thing where I need to figure out the path, oh I just clicked off the

02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:27.460
door, it's a very buggy but a good kind of buggy, right okay bridge, click,

02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:35.940
hold on are you doing what I think you're doing, I don't think you're okay, built,

02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:42.660
wait what do you mean it's in the way,

02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:54.500
fuck you,

02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:00.340
fucking caterpillar in the way, I just spent all that money on nothing,

02:45:03.060 --> 02:45:08.340
and it left the freaking construction behind, you stink, don't ever do that again,

02:45:10.740 --> 02:45:15.140
well what do you think about Virginia, not just the US state asking for a reform,

02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:19.780
speak up, you mean you're willing to give me your chair,

02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:31.460
what happened to chat, it's peaceful, it's a little menace, okay develop bumbly beaches, small

02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:37.060
amusement park and a thriving theme park, your objective to have at least 750 guests, oh yeah,

02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:43.780
oh yeah Mr. Krabs and the theme park is not worth, well it's not worth millions, maybe another time,

02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:53.380
oh we did it, post, post game yapping begins, no, still hasn't been fixed, I don't know what's

02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:59.860
going on with the mechanic, but they're not my problem anymore, save, save, and then we're going

02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:09.140
to do post game yapping, oh yeah Mr. Krabs, right I'll mute that and then I'll put my background

02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:14.980
music on, but I'll still have it in the background, and then I'll go big to symbolize this post game

02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:28.020
yapping time, that's right, we're like post game plapping time, oh you like that one, yeah you like

02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:39.940
the other big sweat, but yes tonight I'm recording pregnant with you ASMR, well strongy you can't

02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:48.740
do that, why not, what's stopping me, you, you're gonna stop me, less likely than you think,

02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:57.140
no strongy you can't just post me ASMR, watch me, watch me,

02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:05.460
grain some old school rinse cake, I am doing it at the end of this week, if you want to play,

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:13.380
and by play with me I mean jerk my pintus, nobody can stop, stop being strongy,

02:47:14.100 --> 02:47:21.540
actually I need to get giantess artwork of Azura, I'm going to, I should get a comic

02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:26.020
where everyone's like comparing our heights, so like people can learn the lore of our heights,

02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:29.700
and then the last panels Azura being as tall as a skyscraper and all of us are like

02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:36.100
we didn't know you could do that, but we do know she can do that, but it just helps kind of solidify

02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:46.740
the lore of the girl, um, hi strongy, Nessie's in Loch Ness, that's why she's called Loch Ness

02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:56.660
once though, isn't she in Loch Lomond, am I making up, am I going mental, isn't Loch Lomond

02:47:56.660 --> 02:48:04.740
actually where, and it's like a misnomer, oh when is Azur's Donathon, Azur's Donathon is on Saturday

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:11.780
the 24th of August for 12 hours, it is a limited time Donathon, please do show up, I think all

02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:19.060
of us are going to show up on our stream at one point, um, I think also a few VTubers who have

02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:22.740
been very kind to her are also going to show up, but I'm going to help her out plan at all,

02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:28.660
but please if you're able to show any support, even showing up, not monetary support, please

02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:35.220
don't think you have to, monetary support, um, it's all going to be a hoot and a holler, I'm not

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:41.140
going to be streaming while she streams, so I'm having a short stream that day and then I'm going

02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:47.620
to redirect into her, and then I'm going to show up in her stream most likely, so it's the Saturday

02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:53.140
the 24th of August, her actual birthday is national goat day which is the 21st of August,

02:48:53.780 --> 02:49:00.020
but the Saturday is the better choice, but we will start doing announcements

02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:06.100
when it gets a bit closer to the time, and the Donathon needs to actually be solidified,

02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:11.780
she gave me a list of what the bleeding hearts came up with, so I'm going to work with it and

02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:21.380
then we're going to see what the response will be to the mock sheet, but at the end of her Donathon

02:49:21.380 --> 02:49:27.620
she very most likely can move out, so I'm very excited for her to kind of level up as a content

02:49:27.620 --> 02:49:32.180
creator, because at the moment I think it's fair to say she's a bit limited at the moment, I don't

02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:38.660
think she would disagree with me on the assessment, she's a bit limited, but with the capabilities of

02:49:38.660 --> 02:49:47.620
moving out, then I think Azura is going to step up her game, no that it's not stepped up, she's

02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:54.100
doing what she can in the situation she's in, yeah, Azura is big enough to carry us all, for real,

02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:58.580
literally you guys were like why'd you call her fondula bosom, like I already planned the giant

02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:06.180
test boob artwork, okay, that was planned long ago, hello mommy, hi refling, I know you said you

02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:10.580
don't try games that you might not be good at, but have you ever tried playing a fighting game,

02:50:10.580 --> 02:50:15.700
I have never played one, but apparently you guys can stream snip and tech in or something like that,

02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:24.660
tech in, I would 100% get absolutely walloped in a game like that with you, I wouldn't mind at all,

02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:31.460
what, I can't stop thinking about how stinky you are and how I want to lick you clean so bad,

02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:39.460
I'm the robin, what, no shivers for a week young lady, you have to be nice and right

02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:45.940
for your owners, please make more sent play audios, I mean,

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:54.580
you feeling the sent play, you like it, okay,

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:04.580
whoa, wait, this is the same person, they sent three, that's my good girl, I say they slam your

02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:08.100
survey, I can't read this, I can't read this,

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:21.780
I can't, the message ends with you're gonna be a good mom,

02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:32.900
refling, refling, you're pent up, you need help, come to the convention like right now,

02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:38.180
you need clarity, you need the mental clarity that that release will give you,

02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:46.820
astronomy advises for us to send it and that's a challenge, you need help to send tomorrow,

02:51:46.820 --> 02:51:53.860
question mark, oh wait, I actually have a question mark, hold on, I paid good money for this, tomorrow,

02:51:53.860 --> 02:52:05.540
tomorrow, yeah, tomorrow, maybe, I just need to record the missing ASMRs that I couldn't record

02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:19.460
and then tomorrow, you're doing cons, I don't know yet, I have the 12, I have the 12 anxiety

02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:25.380
which makes things hard, I actually, I told the girls about my situation and they all said

02:52:25.380 --> 02:52:30.660
they'd come and fly out to see me and I was like, I'm gonna cry, I love my daughters, they're too nice

02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:37.460
to be, I explain to them like the reason why I get like severely motion sick and ill and all that

02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:44.340
is because I have spawn, a bomb, I have to be at spawn at all times or I freak out and I can't handle

02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:48.900
it, I can't handle it, but the girls were really nice, they were like, oh we'll come and see you,

02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:55.220
don't forget to thank the paper, no, no, no, that was outrageous, that was an absolutely outrageous

02:52:55.220 --> 02:53:01.140
remark, can you believe it, that was bizarre, that was like randomly attacks you, walks off

02:53:01.140 --> 02:53:06.580
and blocks you before, you can respond, I mean I wouldn't respond, I don't respond to anything,

02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:11.460
but it was just like, I posted it because like me and the girls like obviously we post stuff and

02:53:11.460 --> 02:53:17.220
we're like eh, giggle, giggle and I was like damn, someone was unhappy with that, that short,

02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:27.620
I posted emerses like I'm recognizer and I'm like oh, oh, there's a con in person, no, it would have

02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:37.540
to be Melbourne, if we actually do a convention it would have to be Melbourne, I'm sorry, I can

02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:46.580
hardly go anywhere, I already got so violently ill going to the airport for my dad, was she a

02:53:46.660 --> 02:53:54.260
potential collaborator, no, not as far as I'm aware, not for me anyway, maybe they don't have

02:53:54.260 --> 02:53:59.220
paypegs in urgent, you guys aren't paypeg, I really do not want you guys to start referring,

02:53:59.220 --> 02:54:04.180
like I don't mind it as a meme, but seriously, oh that terminology annoys me, because it's like

02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:10.500
that simp terminology as well, it's like can guys not fucking enjoy anything without being

02:54:10.580 --> 02:54:18.260
like fucking criticised or like made fun of for doing it, like oh my god, oh my god, anyway,

02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:22.740
so that's me, I don't know about you and your thoughts about the situation as a whole, but

02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:27.860
oh my god, can guys not be allowed to enjoy one single thing without being like made fun of,

02:54:27.860 --> 02:54:32.340
oh my god, they can't even fucking breathe, anyway, but that's just me,

02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:39.380
okay, thought I'd send a joke to tear you up,

02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:46.420
my beloved, oh he said the coconut from Elden Ring, what do you call a brand compromise,

02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:53.860
what do you call a band compromise of overweight men, picnic at the disco, slim knot,

02:54:54.580 --> 02:55:02.020
nine inch necks, rage against the vending machine, diabetals, fed zeppelin,

02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:13.060
OB slash CD, obesity, instead obesity, instead of ACDC, nine inch neck as well,

02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:18.500
mommy I'm at work, but the thought of you calling me a loser for letting you win in a video game

02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:23.700
is making me a squirm and mess, I love you, I love breaking you, ravelling more and more,

02:55:23.700 --> 02:55:28.900
tell me more about you being at work and doing things you shouldn't be, but I don't encourage it

02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:38.420
though, for legal reasons, I do not encourage it, if HR gets involved, it wasn't me,

02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:48.420
what are you saying, what are you saying, squibblings, my little squibbling,

02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:52.580
imagine if I was a squid, you guys would be called squibblings, any squibblers,

02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:58.660
I'm squibbling my squabble right now, what does sound do reeflings make, it's not oink oink,

02:55:58.660 --> 02:56:03.540
definitely grunts and whimpers, yes, not oink oink, but yes on the whimpers,

02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:15.380
that kind of, that's what, delicious, nutritious, not really, delicious, oh yeah,

02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:24.500
don't call HR unstrongy, she is the HR, when one of the girls complains that I'm being too overly

02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:30.180
bick, she will towards them, can't relate, sorry, no HR here, bye, sorry, your design's just so

02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:49.780
I am the one who knows, wish I had strong as HR, mine screwed me over, oh I just threw up, screw you,

02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:56.340
you can't make HR to report like harassment, me, alright, let's get to work,

02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:10.500

hello guys, hi, weeping, thank you for the stream, you are welcome and you do come well,

03:00:23.700 --> 03:00:29.300
I was wondering what's your take on artwork that's wholesome, that includes you featuring another

other than to eek, sorry I'm stretching again, hydration check dialing weakening,

03:00:56.180 --> 03:01:06.740
it is, okay, I actually sounded like one of those screamo people, disrespect your sorrow,

03:01:06.740 --> 03:01:12.900
dirt, ink, I don't want to know what happens if we don't let you in,

03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:20.980
in both scenarios, you're getting r-word, I just want to say thank you, I haven't been

03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:27.220
watching you for long, oh yeah, hi, but you are a really sweet and kind person and what you've

03:01:27.220 --> 03:01:31.140
achieved has been amazing, I'm really happy for you, oh thank you for your extended happiness,

03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:36.820
I'm so so kind for you to be happy for me, see that's called empathy and that's awesome to practice,

03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:41.540
so unironically good on you for practicing empathy, if you can find happiness for others as well,

03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:48.740
that's fantastic, I will do that in my education stream about being able to feel emotions through

03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:53.860
other people as well, because it's important to surround yourself in an environment that you'll

03:01:53.860 --> 03:02:02.980
thrive in, and surprise, surprise, I'm surrounded by my beautiful reeflings and I'm absolutely

03:02:02.980 --> 03:02:10.660
thriving, I wonder if there's a correlation, it's almost like we're as addicted to each other,

03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:20.260
um yeah, we're proud of you for sending it and gifting us wonderful veal, I remember,

03:02:20.260 --> 03:02:25.940
I fucking love getting marshmallows and they're and it's like momay thank you so much for like

03:02:25.940 --> 03:02:32.900
giving me mercy Azura, because you guys are like loving them and adoring them and please

03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:38.100
enjoy them to your heart's content, don't ever feel like you're like abandoning me or anything

03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:43.540
like that, I want you to be happy, I want you to consume people that make you happy, that's a

03:02:43.540 --> 03:02:50.340
veal or girl or otherwise, I ain't a jealous, that's not for me, that's not my thing, I want

03:02:50.340 --> 03:02:54.820
you happy, I want you to be able to de-stress, I want you to have some background noise that gives

03:02:54.820 --> 03:02:59.700
you a little giggle, maybe makes you breathe air through your nose a bit faster, that's what I want,

03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:04.900
okay, you want us to eat your daughters, now eat your mom, me shee,

03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:12.500
strongy, how did you discover vealer, I am vealer, I'm all of you, I'm all the girls at once,

03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:21.300
don't, I'm ac and Amy and Azura and Mercy and Sheebie, you didn't smell,

03:03:21.460 --> 03:03:24.500
oh fuck, I was a terrible Azura, right, hold on, do ac, do ac,

03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:35.540
that bites me, fuck, I am the Senate, I am all of vealer, do the voices, shit,

03:03:36.100 --> 03:03:45.700
shit, hold on to the voices, um, did you miss me bleeding heart, are you excited for my

03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:53.060
donut on the moon, I can't wait to move out so I can make all the contents in the world for you,

03:03:54.100 --> 03:04:02.180
can you imagine it now, my little Ripley, oh, uh, bleeding heart, fuck, I'm losing it,

03:04:02.180 --> 03:04:08.020
I'm losing it, not yet, so it's treason then, Shawnee is a big woman, dude, I'm gonna cry

03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:12.660
ashamed here, like, I'll step in, whenever the girls are offline for the day, I'll step in and

03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:19.300
do a little segment of pretending to be them, how about that, Azura on stream, real, she dropped

03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:25.300
at the end, refling heart, damn, you do a fine Azura, I mean, if I whisper I can hate it enough

03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:34.500
that it's not Azura, the vealer house is real, yeah, she's in my house right now, Azura, why are

03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:45.540
you so tall, Jay, Azura, like, I'd be looking up like this, hi, she's so tall, yeah, hi cuddles,

03:04:47.700 --> 03:04:52.500
I just want to let you know that I can't incomlicit your voice, oh, what the fuck,

03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:56.500
why did that sound like I have a kazoo on the end of my throat, what was that, did you hear that,

03:04:56.500 --> 03:05:01.540
that sounded like a broken door or something on its hinges, that was my voice, I'm gonna take a

03:05:01.540 --> 03:05:10.660
hydration check, what the heck, hydration, hydration, you turned into the chicken toy again, no,

03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:19.860
oh, I've forgotten how I did it though, they're doing, would love an Australian Emmy,

03:05:21.780 --> 03:05:27.940
how would I do that, what's wrong, big brother, it doesn't sound like that,

03:05:28.580 --> 03:05:33.220
what are you done, you're out, she's not that high pitched, but for some reason, I think in my head

03:05:33.220 --> 03:05:38.900
my voice is deeper than what it is, so when I try and mimic someone, I go overboard trying to mimic,

03:05:38.900 --> 03:05:44.660
if the vealer house was real, they would need a HR department and they would be begging me to shut

03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:50.980
up, because I like scurreme, I mean, you guys hear, I scurreme, my dad actually complained on the

03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:55.540
Mario Kart stream, I woke him up while I was playing Mario Kart and I was being like, you're

03:05:55.620 --> 03:06:02.260
supposed to let me win, he was like, you're so, I'm like, I'm sorry, I don't fucking have any idea

03:06:02.260 --> 03:06:11.860
what the neighbor's like, what S stream, honestly, HR stands for huge arse department, I like that

03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:19.460
one, I like that one, I like that one, I like that one, I've keeping that one, that one's mine,

03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:23.780
thank you, getting reported to the huge arse department ASMR win, and it's just me sitting on

03:06:23.780 --> 03:06:27.380
the mic, well, I've actually already made that, changing the title right now,

03:06:30.420 --> 03:06:34.340
I just want to let you know, you haven't done much hypno content yet, and I'm already

03:06:35.380 --> 03:06:42.260
pinches broken, please break me more and mold my brain, my pinches and behind, into your tie,

03:06:42.260 --> 03:06:46.180
oh it's fucking over for you if you're already, but I like it that way,

03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:54.020
I can't wait to hear the jingle of the caller while you bounce on it,

03:06:57.700 --> 03:07:05.540
I can't read that, I can't read it, do you understand me, hi Stroni, hi reading,

03:07:07.060 --> 03:07:11.940
this is about the other question about commissioning artwork, oh yeah, I meant wholesome art featuring

03:07:11.940 --> 03:07:18.740
you in a female literature that's not in the alert, yeah, yeah, I mean if we interacted with them,

03:07:18.740 --> 03:07:23.140
then that means I'm cool with them, and they're cool with me, because if they aren't cool with me,

03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:26.660
you publicly wouldn't know I've interacted with them, are you squinting me right now,

03:07:27.780 --> 03:07:32.420
did your dad hear you yelling about how you were gonna, our word the reeflings for beating you,

03:07:32.420 --> 03:07:36.020
and how you were gonna run a train on them after breaking into our houses,

03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:41.300
technically yes, I woke him up

03:07:43.140 --> 03:07:49.140
and he was awake and like watching youtube videos waiting for me to finish my streams,

03:07:50.980 --> 03:07:58.820
so the answer is yes, he heard the ring fit as well, and I was like okay, rather cringe,

03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:08.900
thank you tiny spiny for the hit, but yeah, yo, I wasn't here for the Mario Kart stream, what happened,

03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:18.500
when I get angry, I sometimes make threats against the reeflings, and I'm a bad person for it,

03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:24.500
and I should be ashamed, but I can't stop, because I get really angry and they're just so cute and

03:08:24.580 --> 03:08:32.740
adorable, and they need to let me win, and I start screaming in it anyway,

03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:43.380
I can't read any of these, someone is, someone needs to release right now, because you're doing it,

03:08:43.380 --> 03:08:47.780
and marshmallows, I can't read them out, hey story, listening to you at a restaurant with a

03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:52.660
fam, truly a hard challenge, just struggling not to squirt with your voice, also clam slam me please,

03:08:53.140 --> 03:08:59.540
you want clam slam and elton ring blessings again, okay, you get clam slam at restaurant,

03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:28.580
I got red lobster, are you squidding me right now, red lobster, did you just make brian

03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:38.500
beatbox, did you just make brian beatbox, wrap to it, are we supposed to wrap to that, oh my god,

03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:44.500
right, okay, we'll try again, we'll try again, hold on, are you squidding me right now, we're to

03:09:44.500 --> 03:09:55.460
wrap to this, I'm a reefling, streamer like this, this is so distracting, this is crazy,

03:09:59.540 --> 03:10:09.060
thank you eyeperror, brian, why is he saying beach mouse, is that supposed to be

03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:19.140
mud on your face, your big disgrace, something else my arse on your face, we will, we will

03:10:19.860 --> 03:10:29.620
face it, okay, I had a dream where we were kissing and I was so pent up, I woke up and

03:10:30.260 --> 03:10:36.100
I woke up you, tasted and felt so good, I love you, I love you reefling, are you dreaming of me,

03:10:37.860 --> 03:10:45.300
do I look like, how do I look like here in your dream, I don't, my dreams never work out to

03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:52.500
anything, all my dreams are nightmares from high school, all my dreams are like nightmares, I have

03:10:52.500 --> 03:11:00.340
a lot of kittens getting heart dreams as well, I had a cat dream, oh my god, I had a freaking cat

03:11:00.340 --> 03:11:08.580
dream last night, I had a kitten, no I had a cat that I adopted and it had kittens before I could

03:11:08.580 --> 03:11:14.820
get it neutered and I was so worried about it because obviously it's very dangerous for cats to have

03:11:15.380 --> 03:11:19.220
well it's dangerous for anything to give birth because you know giving birth is dangerous

03:11:19.220 --> 03:11:24.980
and I felt so bad and rotten because I put her in so much pain, yeah, so this is, I have nightmares

03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:30.260
about like cats getting hurt and stuff, I don't like it, I love my poodles, I love all poodles,

03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:35.060
I've never been so jealous of a cat dream, no I hate the dreams, yeah,

03:11:36.340 --> 03:11:42.340
stronti, stronti is a true goth only nightmares, I never remember good dreams, they say you dream

03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:47.300
every night but I only seem to ever remember the negative stuff which is always like cats getting

03:11:47.300 --> 03:11:52.660
hurt and stuff and I hate it, like I'll wake up and I'll know it's not real but I hate it, I hate it,

03:11:56.900 --> 03:12:01.060
I just got here, why do I look so cute as a reef on a screen, that's you in the bathtub

03:12:01.060 --> 03:12:05.620
getting ready to sponge me down for the 10k is more screen, I don't really have dreams,

03:12:05.620 --> 03:12:14.580
someone pointed out it's a sign of psychopathy, what, psychopathy, I'm sure you're right,

03:12:16.340 --> 03:12:20.180
I rarely dream but when I do it it's getting rather weird, I only remember nightmares and

03:12:20.180 --> 03:12:29.540
dirty dreams, I think I'm too stressed to have dirty dreams, you're my dream, literally you're

03:12:29.540 --> 03:12:37.860
my dream, I wake up, wake up, it's the first of the month, no, but like we send each other,

03:12:38.820 --> 03:12:44.980
well I say we send each other, I'm gonna start using my alt twitter more, okay, I promise you just

03:12:44.980 --> 03:12:49.060
need to let me cook because I'm a bit behind, I didn't actually expect to be so behind on work

03:12:49.060 --> 03:13:04.260
when my dad visited but, ah, hi strongy, how we playing, alt time, I saw Mercy posted this thing

03:13:04.260 --> 03:13:10.100
on her alt and I'm like I'm so ready to absolutely annihilate everyone by writing stuff like that,

03:13:10.100 --> 03:13:19.220
like doing like small creative things like that, I cannot wait to do it and it's over for your

03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:25.140
pentas, hi strongy, hi meeting, thank you for making Hypno themed ASMR this week, I hope you're

03:13:25.140 --> 03:13:29.380
looking forward to it, I have to script it and I'm not looking forward to scripting it because I

03:13:29.380 --> 03:13:33.460
get worried I'm going to mess up and then someone's going to be like eh you're not really in a hypno

03:13:33.460 --> 03:13:44.100
you're just doing it for the gag and it's like no I like it, I'm going to the UK, any recommendations

03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:51.460
for what to do in Scotland as much as it pains me, I was like last week and Edinburgh has better

03:13:51.460 --> 03:14:00.580
tourist attractions, there's the National Museum in Edinburgh and then there's also an art gallery,

03:14:01.540 --> 03:14:07.380
it will probably take like three hours to do them both, like together, if you kind of want to

03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:13.060
blitz through it, the National Museum is a lot better than the art gallery, if you're not really

03:14:13.060 --> 03:14:22.260
into art but I like physical art, like the old physical art, does that make sense, what's the

03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:33.300
most down bad thing you've ever done, before debut someone wrote a green text post, I said I'm a way

03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:44.980
to work, I shlicked and I posted the evidence on my alt twitter, I literally like, I think it was

03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:53.060
it wasn't even major, it was like eight sentences and obviously because of the stress of like

03:14:53.060 --> 03:15:02.020
organising violour, I had not done anything for ages and someone made this like a really quick

03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:11.140
post and I read it and I was like well that's enough for me to get started, that's probably the

03:15:11.220 --> 03:15:16.500
most down bad because it was like eight sentences and it was just pixels on a screen you know,

03:15:17.540 --> 03:15:23.460
like it was just words on a screen, it wasn't like it was a video or an audio or anything of that

03:15:23.460 --> 03:15:30.100
nature, it was just words on a screen and it was like eight sentences, yeah I was pretty down bad,

03:15:30.100 --> 03:15:39.780
not gonna lie that was like really down bad, dudes would see two circles and go hmm I'm only human

03:15:39.860 --> 03:15:49.700
after all, I'm only a cuttlefish after all, imagination is so so much more powerful, real

03:15:49.700 --> 03:16:01.780
true based, retweet, repost anything, true true true, I'd make you have sweet nasty dreams,

03:16:02.500 --> 03:16:09.780
if I was using my mouth on you will you sleep, no no mouth on clam, like two, don't say that to me,

03:16:09.780 --> 03:16:18.500
no mouth on clam and I'm the one who does stuff to you in your sleep, not the other way around,

03:16:24.020 --> 03:16:30.180
I want to spend a week inside of you, soft or hard, sleeping, working, playing video games,

03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:35.220
eating, going to the bathroom, picking up flirries, you want to be in my tummy or do you want to be

03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:40.900
in my womb, well if you be in my womb I can keep you in for longer, if you're in my tummy you may

03:16:40.900 --> 03:16:53.700
get digested, I'm not gonna lie, we need to think of the logistics of this, oh thank you

03:16:53.700 --> 03:17:00.100
Rilke Cadmus, I appreciate that, I'm just worried like because I've never had a big massive wallop

03:17:00.100 --> 03:17:05.300
at it like I've enjoyed it in passing and all of that but like to actually make it it makes me so

03:17:06.340 --> 03:17:17.380
nervous, oh that's something I have insecurity about, the quality of my hypno content, oh there's

03:17:18.260 --> 03:17:24.740
my weakness, there you go, we were kind of talking about how like I don't have imposter syndrome or

03:17:24.740 --> 03:17:28.660
anything like I'm not gonna get out with that but I don't normally have weaknesses when it comes to

03:17:28.660 --> 03:17:32.100
content creation because you're gonna get what you get, I'm never going to be a 10 out of 10

03:17:32.660 --> 03:17:36.980
but hypno content I'm actually a bit insecure about so there you go there's a little insecurity

03:17:36.980 --> 03:17:43.620
that you can poke and prod me with if you really want, how much rent you asking for the worm,

03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:54.500
oh for the whim, no rent for free, whim, a whole week no pillow, real, only wiefling arm, I do it

03:17:54.500 --> 03:17:59.860
to you but you can't do it to me, you get a dorm loss, dorm loss is fine, I'm fine with dorm loss

03:17:59.860 --> 03:18:03.060
that doesn't bother me at all, if anything I encourage dorm loss, yes yes yes yes yes

03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:12.980
and it's your lore unfortunate by like hypno stuff, yeah I I wanted to try it that's what it's all

03:18:12.980 --> 03:18:21.060
that's what strongy's all about, see I promise I'll I paid a lot of money for these I promise

03:18:21.060 --> 03:18:26.580
I'll use the toggles okay I promise I'm gonna use them on the hypno stream okay so you know

03:18:27.460 --> 03:18:32.020
and then if you need something a bit bigger to focus on then I can leave this in the background

03:18:32.020 --> 03:18:39.620
whilst the spiral still goes you know okay okay back to back to being a cut of the stone

03:18:39.700 --> 03:18:44.020
but it'll be fine, just send that hypno as much as it can

03:18:44.900 --> 03:18:48.340
I'm only okay I will send it but I need to make the script that's the only thing

03:18:50.260 --> 03:18:53.460
okay you're allowed to my whim for a week okay there's no rent

03:18:54.020 --> 03:18:59.780
but you do need to hit the magic switch and say it because if you didn't know there's a g-spot inside

03:19:00.180 --> 03:19:03.060
and you would be right at it

03:22:59.380 --> 03:23:05.060
the reeflings you control when they ink but in the stream you tell them they have to save it and have

03:23:05.060 --> 03:23:11.780

03:40:04.900 --> 03:40:08.660
because like obviously we got a lot of flak on first booted up like folk were like oh my god the

03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:13.220
infighting's gonna go wild mean where we're like literally in each other's dms like here's a picture

03:40:13.220 --> 03:40:20.820
of my ass um and they're like oh there's infighting and all that the company's gonna implode or

03:40:20.820 --> 03:40:27.860
whatever and it's like obviously because your first interaction could visibly visibly a velour

03:40:27.860 --> 03:40:32.980
could have been like a negative opinion you can maintain that negative opinion without ever having

03:40:32.980 --> 03:40:39.140
consumed any of us genuinely that's like a thing that happens like um I've kind of seen it on

03:40:39.140 --> 03:40:44.820
amaranth if you didn't know amaranth gets like a hell a lot of flak and people will go watch her

03:40:44.820 --> 03:40:51.780
for the first time and be like oh she actually like isn't that bad at all type thing and then

03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:56.740
it's kind of like a repeating pattern it happens like public's opinion that i've never consumed that

03:40:56.740 --> 03:41:02.660
creator can overshadow the actual creator and what they do and it isn't until you go out of your

03:41:02.660 --> 03:41:07.300
comfort zone and consume a new content creator that you can kind of like challenge those like

03:41:07.300 --> 03:41:12.820
impressions or um those thoughts that or things that you might have thought were true but then

03:41:12.820 --> 03:41:18.500
like you're hopping stream and it's like oh shit let's play sonic heroes um and uh even
