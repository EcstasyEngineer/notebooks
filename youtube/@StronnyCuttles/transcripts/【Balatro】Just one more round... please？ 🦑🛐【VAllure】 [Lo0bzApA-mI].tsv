1284280	1287480	celestial pack
1288680	1293320	actually here we're it doesn't matter if we spend the four we're only getting
1293320	1297880	two dollars interest anyway we're getting we're only getting two dollars
1297880	1306240	DJ and doker and Uranus a straight and a high high card as straight I feel like
1306240	1311680	might actually come up more than well two pairs is kind of a Hail Mary for us so
1311680	1320080	I'll go Uranus he's a troublemaker right next round all diamond cards are
1320080	1325600	debuff that's fine I don't really think that's a problem right we did just
1325600	1333880	double up pairs a upgrade pair so we're gonna send it and we unlock to Joker
1333880	1339520	don't mind me don't mind me at all okay and we got our interest that's

1434760	1440560	for every discard this one shit that was a really good one then I apologize I did
1440560	1445680	not read that properly but look this is why we learning on screen I was wondering
1445680	1449920	if I should record solo runs of me playing this and upload it as actual
1449920	1454760	like video content like oh this is the best one I've had but I don't know if
1454760	1462000	that's weird you can triple to occur so you play so you play five hands with
1462000	1466480	one times and one oh no okay that's not for me
1467440	1477680	spectral card spectral card I have no idea what's a spectral card is that the
1477680	1482960	one where it turns the card gold in that and no that would actually can kill
1482960	1487920	fee free to make some videos yes some people try it you know what try I will
1487920	1495720	try it what's going on here creates the planet card for final player poker hand
1495720	1502600	it's been held okay that's what we'll see create a tarot card if discarded I will
1502600	1507280	shove a discard because it's easier to discard than have it sitting on your hand

1724640	1729840	the boys with a booming system top-down AC with a cooling system when they come
1729840	1734080	up in the club I'd be blazing up they got stacks on stacks on decks like they
1734080	1738520	save it up is that what you wanted to hear to be honest
1741400	1745360	okay I finished my tea I actually finished my tea and I'm hydrated think
1745360	1750360	of the economy I know it's in shambles because people are paying off their debts
1750360	1756360	in society is built for you to be indebted and sleep planet cards appear more
1756360	1763840	frequently played face cards have a chance to give me money
1763840	1775480	I'll take it you have to tell me twice I'm wondering oh right if I do this I get
1775480	1782800	$3 if I do this I get $1 in interest which is really greedy but I kind of
1782800	1790920	want planets or what saved the run I'm sorry but mummy's gambling after
1790920	1798760	defeating the boss gain 25 extra hmm next-based addition there's a free thing
1798760	1812160	a extra large blind soon made the strongy man come to bring us reef flings soon

1838320	1842240	that's why I'm trying to invest in planets because the bonus that planets
1842240	1847280	give is just insane I only have full house and three of a kind levelled up
1847280	1854720	I'm needing to invest in planets oh I'm needing to invest in planets

1898720	1905960	it went okay because of that factor oh we're actually went off from a flush you
1905960	1914200	know that I really don't want to throw these away but I want to play face
1914200	1927040	card okay okay okay pop again do it oh we go six doll hairs because so much
1927120	1931080	bonus wait and the bonus counted because we've reached the bonus so we're
1931080	1939760	gonna when blind is like to destroy Joker to the right and permanently add
1939760	1948160	double it's that's a member getting paid please straw me moan quietly I have you
1948160	1953640	on speakers oh there we go nice and quiet the gulping in the burps made me
1953640	1958000	think of Emmys Pandario I listened to that for the first time yesterday I was
1958000	1961400	actually too scared to listen to it and I listened to it and I was like oh wow
1961400	1969720	I actually don't mind we're losing her to the gambon yeah move the polychrome
1969720	1975960	Joker to the far right it will give you most mullies in that position see I
1975960	1980880	don't know how you guys know that but it's so good you guys are so smart right
1980920	1986480	this is useless we're gonna keep economy keep economy choose one of three
1986480	1995200	playing cards to add to the deck oh wait hold on what a waste of fucking money
1995200	2006480	were you next base it becomes a polychrome 1.5 multi what the sigma first
2006520	2013640	played face card gives to multi I might skip in order to get this 1.5 multi one
2013640	2018280	because you're starting to you're starting to grind my gears and you're
2018280	2025240	not really doing too much I can't reroll the boss if I decide to 20k wall is a
2025240	2032600	risk are you sure I feel like I make so much money I'm like doing this in one
2032600	2040280	round I have four hands personally played up to purple steak with a few
2040280	2047200	deck oh do we do it jokers activate left to right yeah if you wanted the audio
2047200	2051560	it'd be more realistic there'd be a kiss if you need gulp and burping
2051560	2058800	photograph but can't photograph is kind of weak yeah if you skip you go straight
2058840	2063360	to the boss though purple steak is doable if you've got the good jokers
2063360	2070480	you will have to fish for the full house to save the wall shit okay what does it

6660840	6666520	I want to get 50 economy I'm not I'm I don't feel very confident about our run I'm being honest
6668040	6677640	unless unless unless unless the tarot cards I can start swapping deck to like one deck color
6678520	6683560	shit you only get five interest right now anyway
6696680	6699960	I guess it's wheel of fortune who do I want to on though like
6700520	6701020	me
6705320	6709480	please the last tire or planet card use none so it's not gonna do anything
6710840	6715480	either stencil or bluish the hanged man destroy
6716680	6723880	fuck it the wheel fuck it I love a good gamble oh oh I'm gonna get rid of that if I'm in trouble
6724680	6734040	oh well I tried okay let's see what's going on here create two random tarot cards sure
6734840	6743720	what we got two planet doubles money sure don't mind if I do create up to two random
6743720	6752360	planet cards okay I'm going for a flush I tried doesn't mean I got it but I'll upgrade these just
6752360	6759000	in case I find myself in a rough spot when blind is selected destroy joker to the right and
6759000	6765160	permanently I double itself out I don't get that at first hand of round has only one card no
6766200	6770680	okay knife will get stronger both destroying jokers and will enhance stencil
6770760	6771260	so
6775560	6777880	they won't paramount enhance stencil
6780600	6783560	I'm gonna end up leaving stencil behind
6786920	6793320	and wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on let me think let me think let me think
6794280	6802600	if I actually sell these two no they have temples multi oh I can't do math
6804120	6811080	oh my head is spinning stencil needs sell yes that's what I'm thinking get rid of stencil
6811080	6816360	for better stuff that comes in okay we're getting rid of stencil I'm sorry I'm sorry if it's the wrong
6816360	6821720	choice but I want rid of stencil right if it's all the same color flush it down what we got
6821720	6826840	we've got three hearts and we've got three jacks
6829320	6831560	and the deck is equal as it can be
6837240	6841800	oh I need to commit to one color what do you want heart
6842600	6852440	think hard think hard me think hard are you joking I'm a dumber okay we got another heart
6855720	6857240	okay we got no heart
6859880	6863320	finally one two three four five go
6864280	6874680	okay that's good that's good we are ahead but we're gonna need to get some juicy upgrades
6874680	6881160	what do you do 10 multiplier if you click no uh face face cards give a
6883640	6886120	they are not making this one easy really crap
6886200	6894120	select two to convert the ray creates a random joker must have room what we do random joker
6895080	6896200	our emperor again
6899000	6903080	I don't know I like doing the wheel just for the hell of it if this flush could grab the wheel
6903080	6912680	that'd be great wheel move wrestler in front yes sorry sorry sell stencil fuck you bitch
6913240	6915800	that's right I'm good at listening
6916680	6921400	so stencil can't pick up the wheel okay so I want to sell locador
6923000	6929560	I'm leaving him to win because if he picks up the wheel again I'm gonna be pissed
6930840	6934520	okay no one got the wheel that's fine um
6935400	6935900	um
6937800	6942040	I honestly I'm needing something to help with these fluffy
6944280	6950120	nothing's kind of helping me have pick up smells sure
6952840	6956360	wow nothing's really helping me though we're not really getting shaped
6958680	6961080	I don't give a fuck oh wait shit I do
6965320	6972600	I'm sure I'll hit something fuck that was awful
6974920	6980120	fuck it ah right what color diamonds I've got three
6985640	6991720	okay did I just lose like so many diamonds in that pack am I going crazy
6995480	7001880	so there's hardly any diamonds in the pack that three are on the board that's why and I used to
7003880	7011320	oh you know what all these and then go for clubs clubs have a higher chance
7014920	7018920	and not clubs the other one no one two three four
7019560	7027240	right so I just need one more then oh my god I'm so sorry I'm just joking right it's hard
7030360	7033480	couldn't actually you know what we're never doing flush again because we
7034600	7042840	right about time go I swear this game loves trolling like it genuinely loves trolling
7043400	7048360	okay we got 12 that's good
7050280	7055160	played cards with suit gives a fucking three plus no one consumable slot
7055160	7061160	this is specific I'll show you my consumable slot I'll have you know adds double the rank
7062120	7068040	uh pick that up and go for spade flush spade flush okay
7068040	7074840	okay whatever we can say because I'm too dumb to figure out how the freaking flushes work
7075480	7079480	the only thing I'll be flushing is myself down the toilet because I remember what I'm playing
7083000	7087640	uh actually good hello actually good hello hello hello hello
7089720	7093880	hello actually good okay then what are you
7094840	7100280	all right as much as you want to find the arena packs and convert the space as much as possible
7100280	7105960	literally wow are you oh a tarot card when destroyed
7108680	7109480	I'm tempted
7112520	7118120	I'm tempted I think the tarot gamble use that and convert it to a spade
7118360	7124920	yeah I know exactly one consumable slot this thing up here
7127400	7130760	I mean do I need it not really
7133960	7141880	maybe if I accidentally redeem the um not the hyrule fan the one that gives to right spade
7142200	7148120	and a spade looks like this yeah goodbye everything
7150120	7156120	goodbye everything goodbye everything goodbye everything I want a spade card
7156920	7164120	spade and spade yeah goodbye okay one two three four five let's go

7176840	7181560	wait wait wait wait I had this splash card in another run is this not op is anything
7184120	7188680	is this not op is anything splash isn't great on flush though
7189640	7198600	oh no say it's not true hold on hold on say it's not true not good with a flush build
7198600	7203080	no how fucking how many times have you guys played this game how do you move so well
7204200	7212360	um right okay spade a face card a flush and then I can sell that when I panic
7212920	7219000	actually what's ahead of me playing cards played against with that air debuff that's fine
7219560	7223560	I I'm gonna be honest I don't think this is a winning run I've maxed out a deck in this game
7223560	7229080	and all difficult okay now far too much never played it I have like 60 plus hours that's decent
7230120	7237080	you gotta start putting face uh face cards yes that will be very nice
7237800	7245320	right my lovely spade you're not spade you're not spade you're spade you're not you're not you are
7246360	7246840	goodbye
7253960	7255640	can I just do that though
7258920	7263880	I know it's not a face card but I think it gives me enough
7264840	7267080	hold on let's test it how much does it give me
7269240	7273880	oh no oh no that's actually not good
7278760	7284680	sorry buy suit yes sorry I said I was gonna do that and then I'm not doing that okay so
7286680	7289000	I guess we're better going for clubs now
7289640	7297400	I said we're better going for cut loves now thank you
7299880	7303320	okay uh I will be admit I don't think I'm that confident
7306360	7312120	we have such high economy but we have nothing decent to spend it on right what are you
7313160	7318680	15 plus multi not times plus because there's a difference if you didn't know like don't
7318680	7323800	worry if you're new to the game don't be embarrassed if you're learning but you know some
7323800	7330440	some classic noobs don't know the difference between plus 15 and times multipliers there's
7330440	7338360	such goofy cubers you know right what are you a flat four multiplier you're just plus four you're
7338440	7339560	not times four though
7345080	7346440	I don't think we've won this run
7348760	7354120	so goofy I know it's okay you don't need to be embarrassed though like it happens
7354120	7357640	create a copy of a joker destroys all other jokers oh
7358440	7360440	oh
7366040	7370600	converse all cards in hand to a single random suit
7374360	7378200	there's too many clubs here to sacrifice into something else
7379320	7381560	gamble or do you want me to gamble it
7382200	7385000	fuck it
7388360	7391640	wait is that the right one was that the right one I didn't see it
7394520	7398360	oh my god it was the right one
7400600	7407640	wait it wasn't wait oh it wasn't it was club sorry they're both the same color so I can hardly see
7407720	7413720	the difference oh sorry I get confused between these symbols I feel like they're so similar
7413720	7418360	because they both have three points on them like do you know what I mean like point point point
7418360	7424440	flat point point point flat like they're the same thing I don't know if that sounds silly but
7424440	7429000	they're the same they're different but the same turn on high contrast mode you don't have to tell
7429000	7440600	me twice setting and before this is gonna be like so obvious now someone tears okay basically just
7440600	7449640	run in black suit flush now okay I mean I might as well just add a random freaking thing yeah
7449640	7452600	sure it's not gonna over discard it yeah
7456920	7463800	I'm needing I'm needing something better than what we've got I don't I do not believe I'm sorry I don't
7463800	7472840	believe I'm so oh it's blue abadi abadi right we have more blues than oh wait so yeah no already
7473560	7481000	I don't actually want to discard these too much though ah I don't like this run
7484920	7486440	I don't like this run at all
7491240	7496200	okay that was incredibly lucky because now we're gonna try and get spades one
7496200	7502760	which we are very close to getting a spade flush oh but I don't like this
7504520	7510120	discard creates a turret when discarded that's what I want that's what I want to see baby what
7510120	7516680	do you do two planet cards fuck it give me it yeah give me a street flush what do you do yeah
7516680	7520120	give me a flush that's actually what we needed okay one two three four five
7520360	7523400	why do you
7533080	7539640	fine then geez why is that so it's so pernicki it doesn't like me oh for gonna see great
7541720	7545320	creates a turret card when discarded well you're out what we looking at
7545640	7548360	there's actually quite a lot clubs right let's just
7550680	7555560	let's just throw everything into the wind what are you enhances multi-card
7556760	7559240	unbelievably we actually did it
7561320	7564600	and oh wow it removed their debuff as well how interesting
7566840	7573800	well that was considerable that Empress came in clutch I think we're gonna have to definitely
7573800	7580120	utilize turret cards a bit more re-rolls cost two bucks less well that's rubbish uh no that's rubbish
7581400	7583480	we are we are out here
7587000	7592040	we're doing what's called a flush not a straight a straight's when it's in a roll oh my god
7594200	7599320	a straight flush is the best we got like didn't even need Luke Kador I don't know
7600040	7603720	that interaction existed thanks for teaching me something what did it what did I do
7605400	7608040	you played them earlier that's why they're except okay

7664200	7664920	these are shit
7667800	7670280	I don't know if I should buy that and just burn through
7671240	7674840	I feel like if we don't do something now we're in so much trouble
7679480	7687320	no no these are awful nothing is complimenting

7983400	7989240	no flush and only log you just unlabeled flush I mean it's free
7998200	8011640	this is the worst I think we've ever had flush finally took you long enough to show up don't
8011640	8018040	be shy to show up again I'm gonna need a permanent hand if we want to even have a slim chance of
8018040	8026360	winning right who is my most I've got clubs give me more club and club club money or club
8026360	8031960	sitting in the hand if it sits in the hand it's a lot more valuable
8033640	8040360	we're just splashed it's splash it's splash terrible pick up the voucher it's basically
8040360	8046680	a lifeline yes I actually agree uh do we want oh my god sorry if I go bug bite on my leg
8046760	8048680	refling what if you just bit me

8058120	8063880	all right okay splash does nothing sorry splash is good if your hand doesn't have less than five
8063880	8069560	cards okay it was me no I thought I literally just thought bug bite that's probably the only
8069560	8074280	scary thing no fuck off I don't believe it's gonna be any good Ardua
8076920	8079320	oh my god I think I'm gonna have to double skip
8082040	8088680	I need I'm like struggling to win but if I can have three hands in a round without having to discard
8090840	8095480	oh fuck it fuck it we're we're hardly gonna win so let's just go bigger go home
8095480	8097480	um
8099000	8105880	gee willikers I wonder what that card is hmm it's a mystery well good luck I sure hope I don't mess
8105880	8110600	this one up okay I love sorting by suit okay
8113960	8114280	okay
8117080	8121640	there's so little hearts in the deck you guys are not worth having around
8122440	8131320	diamonds again you're rare but we're only one off oh I wonder what that one is
8132360	8138600	chucks the game almost got me I don't think I'm gonna make it maybe
8140680	8143480	right if I hold you in my hand I'll hold you
8152200	8156680	oh wow I actually did it holy crap that paid off I don't know how about I did
8157640	8159160	okay right what is my joker
8163960	8169480	wait hold on copies the joker ability to the right hold on hold on hold on hold on
8172840	8175320	right you're about to perish anyway
8181960	8188840	what do you do speed okay yeah blueprint but with what
8193320	8199080	I think blueprint and then joker and then get rid of photograph
8200280	8203560	and that's gonna expire naturally which is fine
8203560	8211320	so get rid of joker because he only does it once
8213480	8219560	first played face card gives the times two multi win scoring I get that it's big but
8224280	8230600	yeah just get rid of photograph okay sell you copies the ability the joker to the right so buy
8230600	8242680	you put you here and then sell spritz because it's gonna expire anyway I understand I just get rid
8242680	8252360	of straight joker um what crafty joker you want rid of him it is only 80 chips if it's a flush
8253320	8262120	yeah no I'm um what do I need to sacrifice I feel like that's gonna expire so there's no
8262120	8263320	point in keeping it around
8267480	8269320	mmm the 80 chips
8273160	8279880	I feel like you're doing nothing bro I do right so copies the ability to the right and it's compatible
8279880	8290920	so it's giving me 15 multi plus 10 multi for an extra 25 multi flush isn't worth it yeah
8292600	8300840	have blueprint next to seltzer for now okay I will agree with that and then when it perishes
8301720	8311960	we will move it in front of him rip chips stop have a mess up please give me joker oh my god this
8311960	8312760	game hates me
8319000	8323640	none of these are useful for me right now unfortunately well I'll go with planet earth
8323640	8329800	because why not right we're gonna do playing card because I want to keep adding to my clubs
8329800	8330600	basically

8424360	8431640	I know right please jipper is all I ask thank god and it is a flush all the same color
8432520	8438760	it's all the same color flush it down the toilet okay and then we're gonna add
8439400	8444680	uh another club from this pack that we're a hundred percent gonna get

9767400	9771240	you need to be at the end though so it's like active and then you
9772680	9774600	sell two pairs and buy a new joker
9774760	9781480	sell two pair and buy a new joker and now sell the first joker
9783320	9784440	Gigi should be at the end
9787960	9794760	why sell two pair yeah because my triple will get counted in a two pair if I do full house angle as well
9794920	9805320	fill house will trigger both of those yes that I re-roll to get a multi activity
9808120	9811880	I mean one re-roll can't hurt yeah he literally got it well
9813880	9817720	four of a cane no hi hi no
9818360	9824600	um yeah this is another rough looking one I'm gonna be honest
9828680	9831480	oh wait did I just fuck up did I just fuck up
9837160	9844040	I hope I didn't mess up no okay right so you're gonna activate when a double goes
9844040	9846760	you are gonna help you
9850520	9856040	I see aces so get rid of all of this oh I'm so close to a flush
9858840	9862520	honestly four of a kind apart you have to sell some jokers in New York yeah
9864840	9871160	right two pair three of a kind so I need a right I need to fill house
9872120	9876920	how am I so proud of this girl can I get a king or an ace please
9885160	9886760	I'm just gonna have to play something
9888360	9892200	two pair go for it and the ace should trigger on that at least
9892600	9903880	what do you do oh piss it's always too late increases the rank of up to two cards by one
9906760	9914600	right so I'm gonna make some nine some tens I know I suck you don't have to tell me
9915560	9924040	it's silly compare up to three selective cards to clubs sure let's make everything clubs
9924040	9929400	like it makes a difference to this point I can do a flush if I want to
9930840	9936360	uh just do two pairs again for how strong are you better than giving to me I'm getting
9936360	9942840	rolled and is this deck is like so hard for no reason hold on I want a double
9949000	9960600	there's more three four and six and eight can go three four six and eight can go and then I can get
9967320	9974040	I know for a fact I'm reading these odds correctly and being trolled out the wazoo
9978360	9984200	I know I am reading these correctly and can get a full house I am being trolled so hard
9984200	9992120	with odds right now holy holy holy holy holy holy right eight can get to fuck
9992520	9994920	six can get to fuck
9998200	10001640	I can I'm getting trolled so bad looking at the odds honestly
10005880	10010600	well where are you when your room begins add a random playing card with a random
10010600	10018920	feel to your hand well that's kind of cool four of a kind I don't really have that choose a joker
10022440	10024920	well it's gonna have to be better than anything I've got on my persons
10029400	10031320	every played card counts in scoring
10033240	10039960	gain 15 chips if it's a straight times four multi if played hand contains four of a kind
10039960	10049160	that's so rare I don't have any played it it's an uncommon the rare you want splash
10049160	10055240	is splash good with my current thing baseball jokers like having a laugh at me just sell them
10061640	10070280	no wait splash is bad oh the one in the shop is uncommon my apologies okay just skip these
10070680	10083400	I don't think I'm going to get rid of what eight chips or 12 plus
10091080	10097880	what one sell the two of a kind pair two of a kind okay I'll take your advice
10098440	10104040	and you come right so now you are giving me multiplier for that as well when round begins
10104040	10112280	add a random playing card with a random seal in your hand or or a seal in in your hand more likely
10112280	10121000	than you think okay add a playing card make it good make it a tarot or something oh right
10121080	10127400	we roll so I can boost him boom right what do you do a joker a tarot a planet and a
10127400	10134760	spectral card may appear multiple times what does that mean this joker gains three plus
10134760	10139640	chips paired discarded club card new card with a seal
10143400	10150120	two parts is in the Fibonacci sequence he's better than scholar is he I mean I'll take
10150120	10156840	him he's uncommon so he's gonna hit with him fuck you scholar and you come you
10159560	10167640	we now have 1.5345 and then six times six multiplier because of all these guys
10168840	10172680	surely that's how it works surely I'm gonna re-roll again to give him a little boost
10173640	10180440	I know I shouldn't but each played queen of diamond gives a two times malt that's a bit much
10181880	10186680	I mean you could get like multiple of the baseball jokers yeah I feel like a bit of that
10188200	10191640	that was like a dog and not a seal or or wait moose
10195720	10201640	am I good pup for you so many uncommon literally that's uncommon as well
10203560	10211160	that one's far too specific though yeah what do you mean my seal sound isn't good or
10211160	10219720	or you know you you buy upgrade high card by three levels well I'm not playing high far
10220440	10228120	first hand is drawn face down that's fine well why did you shake when discarded
10228120	10238200	I've got three discarded not discard me I don't really want to discard these either
