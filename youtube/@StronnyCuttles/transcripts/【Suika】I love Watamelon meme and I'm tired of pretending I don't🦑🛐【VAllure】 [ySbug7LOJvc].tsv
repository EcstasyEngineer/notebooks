0	10000	Oh wait, how do you fit me in life?
10000	19000	I don't know what to pop it, ah good morning, I see it, it says I'm up, I'm sorry I'm up,
19000	29000	good morning, good evening, good afternoon, we've learned, hiya, America, hiya, hiya,
29000	35000	I literally just woke up right, and then I quickly scrolled Twitter whilst I've got like
35000	39000	literally one thirty seconds to my name after like booting up the stream and everything
39000	45000	and Emmys like, wait actually you know what, I can freaking quote it and I can let you listen to
45000	51000	hold on let's find, oh my god I don't have any DMs with Emmys on Twitter, oh my god proof that there's
51000	59000	inciting at me allure, right are you ready for this, her most recent tweet that I just saw,
59000	65000	wow I'm so happy I'm not three hours into a shift at the cash register dealing with old people
65000	71000	complaining that the newspaper got ten cent more expensive, I love my job, also Emmys
71000	75000	get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant, get fucking pregnant you precious little slut, get pregnant
75000	85000	yeah, damn straight you love your job either one, we're playing Wata Melan
85000	93000	and I love the Wata Melan meme, no the meme is not overused is I had email notifications on and just got here
93000	97000	I hide them for hours playing Suika or Suika or Suikobliat
97000	107000	so yeah, I have email notifications on I'm still late, why would you have email notifications on, that's so curse
107000	115000	but I feel okay today please don't worry, I looked at Marshmallow, I'm so sorry for worrying anyone
115000	119000	I did not, I've never played this game before, no
119000	125000	I am so sorry for stressing anyone out, I'm gonna quickly read the super chats I missed yesterday
125000	131000	Sada, thank you for the extended membership and their message was face
131000	133000	like the capital D face
133000	137000	Veeler Lover, how the hell can she be a tease when she's still out of breath
137000	141000	because on my dying breath I will be a tease
141000	145000	Nero2276, thank you for the super chat, is this the bite of Vsucky?
145000	148000	is this the bite of 87?
148000	150000	good reference, anonymous
150000	154000	I've once heard that females can have miniature inking from work out, this is true
154000	160000	Stony's panting sounds like she's recording an audio, no no no
160000	168000	it is true, women can experience a floor firework if you will, a floor muscle firework
168000	174000	thank you for that tip anonymous and then anonymous said good job mami
174000	178000	good job Riflin, you did amazing, now give us
178000	184000	now give us you a nice little, oh massage all over your body, I'll take it honestly
184000	188000	I'm ironically a bit small, small, so are
188000	194000	but today we are testing if in fact it's true or not
194000	198000	if this game truly has VTubers in a chokehold
198000	202000	jesus, that's blind and first thing in the morning, can we change?
202000	212000	Aladdin, Prince of the Fabulous, he's drowning in water
212000	214000	I do not know the words
214000	218000	can we stop blinding myself, oh my god can you load faster
218000	221000	I thought this was like a tiny little indie game, honestly
221000	223000	are you squidding me right now?
223000	226000	thank you for the super chat really legend
226000	230000	so what I'm hearing is I have to look for a VOD, if you'd like to
232000	236000	okay first off cute adorable, Kawaii-nee
236000	238000	mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay
238000	241000	single player plays, well that's the only option I've got
241000	244000	apparently the DLC's behind the paywall
244000	246000	are you squidding me right now?
246000	248000	still didn't even have the fill thing, I'm not kidding
248000	252000	I've got a cup of tea to wake me up
252000	254000	oh my god reeflings
254000	258000	reeflings, I have something that I need to keep for you guys
258000	260000	only you guys are allowed to know this
260000	264000	don't leak it anywhere or I can't keep leaking stuff
264000	268000	I found artwork of someone that like drew
268000	272000	that draws feet, right?
272000	274000	okay
274000	278000	and I commissioned them to draw everyone's feet in the allure
278000	282000	okay and I was so fucking excited to get that
282000	284000	turned down the game I think a bit
284000	286000	anonymous, thank you for the tip
286000	288000	hi story, I can't believe you and Emmy are going back and forth with our no-
288000	290000	no, no, no, no, Emmy's first
290000	292000	I bet it would be fun to see pinpals versus re-
292000	294000	no, no, no, no, no, no, no
294000	296000	that's not how, personally that's not how I do it
296000	300000	I actually want the girls to be ahead of me
300000	302000	I've kind of said this before
302000	306000	I've put advertisement money behind the girls
306000	308000	but I've not done it myself
308000	310000	the only exception was the trailer
310000	314000	because all of us for debut had to generate some kind of hype
314000	318000	and unfortunately Shibi and Azura's big fat yunkers
318000	322000	stopped their ads from running on their trailer
322000	324000	which is quite upsetting
324000	328000	but I personally do not do it like that
328000	330000	I am not here to outdo my genmys
330000	332000	I actually want them all to succeed
332000	334000	and be ahead of me
334000	336000	so when Emmy went ahead
336000	338000	I was absolutely ecstatic
338000	340000	I truly was ecstatic
340000	342000	and she's still ahead
342000	344000	which I'm very happy about Shibi
344000	346000	I've given an ASMR script too
346000	348000	which she will be recording
348000	350000	soon to end
350000	352000	when she's not at her grand-pappy
352000	354000	parents house
354000	356000	I think that's where she is
358000	360000	boobs
360000	362000	I'm trying to draw, I saw you draw Emmy too
362000	364000	I'm okay
364000	366000	is your sweat toggle still on?
366000	368000	it is!
368000	370000	thank you Reefling
370000	372000	I couldn't see that
374000	376000	thank you Reefling
378000	380000	oh my god I'm such a professional streamer
382000	384000	I also managed to get my order changed
384000	386000	before it came through
386000	388000	so the dog bowl and the dog collar
388000	390000	are gonna say the right things
390000	392000	I don't know how you noticed that
392000	394000	from so far away
394000	396000	I would have played the entire game sweating
396000	398000	literally
398000	400000	I hope you liked my silly drawing
400000	402000	are you joking? I'm yonking at making ASMR
402000	404000	right, how to play Suika
404000	406000	use the
406000	408000	yes
408000	410000	or up and down to move
410000	412000	no we're not doing up and down that's terrible
412000	414000	we'll use the less stick
414000	416000	next press the A button to drop the fruit
420000	422000	uhhhh
422000	424000	okay I guess
424000	426000	I didn't read the rest of the thing
426000	428000	right
428000	430000	okay
432000	434000	hold on
434000	436000	I'm just getting used to the mechanics
436000	438000	if you will
438000	440000	okay
442000	444000	hold on let me get up let me get up
444000	446000	let me go up
446000	448000	so this is what had VTubers
448000	450000	in a choke hold for how long
450000	452000	this
452000	454000	am I addicted yet
454000	456000	the answer sadly is no
456000	458000	I'm not I'm not sure if I'm gonna get addicted
458000	460000	I'm unsure
460000	462000	I have yet to form an opinion on such a game
466000	468000	what's going on here it still has a
468000	470000	choke hold on VTubers does it actually
470000	472000	well I see
472000	474000	someone very
474000	476000	I think someone might have
476000	478000	gone on her throne and got her switch
478000	480000	I said to her
480000	482000	oh I'm playing this game
482000	484000	and I'll recommend it to you
484000	486000	ooh we got a lemon
486000	488000	I'll recommend it to you if you're
488000	490000	wanting
490000	492000	recommendations because I'm trying to help her pick a few games
492000	494000	that are more her style
494000	496000	oh fuck that one up
496000	498000	oops
498000	500000	so I need what pray that
500000	502000	they're just gonna randomly touch each other
502000	504000	okay I guess
504000	506000	oh no I can't reach the orange one
506000	508000	over the mandarin
510000	512000	oh god I think I'm like
512000	514000	really I think I'm screwing this up
514000	516000	sorry wait hold on a minute
516000	518000	I'm messing this up so badly
518000	520000	oopsies I still loving
520000	522000	what kind of games do I see
522000	524000	I see needs a casual experience

526000	528000	so do you
528000	530000	relax

534000	536000	okay or is a familiar game so I'm putting the list together
536000	538000	I didn't mean competing against
538000	540000	oh sorry anonymous I apologize
540000	542000	I did not mean to paint your
542000	544000	tip in that light my apologies that was my fault
544000	546000	I just think it would be fun
546000	548000	to make a challenge of viewer fans
548000	550000	just like Emmy did were pin pals so everyone can
550000	552000	get ahead of you
552000	554000	did she tell you the challenge she did
554000	556000	yes there's actually
556000	558000	this is inside her knowledge
558000	560000	fucking strongy stop leaking inside
560000	562000	your knowledge challenge impossible
562000	564000	I am going to do a meet and

572000	574000	but it's not the water melon
574000	576000	um
576000	578000	I'm literally impossible
578000	580000	for me not to leak in company secrets

586000	588000	um sorry that was
588000	590000	I think that's a meme of some kind
590000	592000	um
592000	594000	I am not strategically playing this game
594000	596000	I actually don't know what I'm doing

612000	614000	again VTubers I might
614000	616000	have to issue a public apology
616000	618000	I might have to
618000	620000	issue on a public apology hold on
620000	622000	a minute
622000	624000	I might have to do it
624000	626000	um right okay company secrets
626000	628000	getting leaked in 4k
628000	630000	I'm having a meeting with the girls
630000	632000	and I'm telling them like hey this method
632000	634000	seemed to really work for me so if you
634000	636000	want to offer free audios
636000	638000	on Twitter in exchange for like
638000	640000	milestones I'm happy with that
640000	642000	like I have so much ASMR
642000	644000	debt and audio debt
644000	646000	on Twitter coming up but once
646000	648000	it's finished like I might
648000	650000	do something like that and be like
650000	652000	oh for I don't even know how many
652000	654000	for 15k subscribers I'll do this
654000	656000	outrageous thing okay see now I'm
656000	658000	starting to block myself
658000	660000	I'm not really
660000	662000	sure what to do
662000	664000	I mean I'll just go for it I mean
664000	666000	it's alright it's just a fun little
666000	668000	goofy game it's actually
668000	670000	oh no oh no this can't be right

672000	674000	no
674000	676000	yes oh well I didn't
676000	678000	expect that one to move actually
678000	680000	oh we got the pitch
680000	682000	oh
682000	684000	head empty drop that motherfucking
684000	686000	boot
686000	688000	apology arc inbound already I prefer
688000	690000	the company leaks in the form of puzzles
692000	694000	okay I'll keep that in mind
696000	698000	okay I'm gonna say something
698000	700000	there may or there may not be
700000	702000	a very high quality artwork
702000	704000	I purchased for the 10th
704000	706000	10,000 subscriber milestone
706000	708000	so once all the girls hit 10,000
708000	710000	subscribers there may or may not
710000	712000	be an adorable artwork of us all
712000	714000	if I've not already leaked it I probably
714000	716000	have already
716000	718000	I prefer company leaks
718000	720000	in terms of the juices
720000	722000	I mean
722000	724000	you know I'm here
724000	726000	I leak literally everything about the
726000	728000	I can't help it I get so excited
728000	730000	but I'm so upset because we actually
730000	732000	have
732000	734000	something
734000	736000	am I gonna block myself? I think I am a
736000	738000	little bit
738000	740000	we actually have something I'm not allowed to leak
740000	742000	right now and all I'm gonna say is it is torture
742000	744000	sorry but I'm not even being dramatic
744000	746000	when I say that it is torture
746000	748000	oh it's so cute
750000	752000	what's like the average score
752000	754000	I wonder if I should like oopsies
754000	756000	I mean maybe it's better it got pushed
756000	758000	over
758000	760000	stop leaking
760000	762000	damn fine can't help it
762000	764000	yeah we have to get everyone to 10k
764000	766000	happy pineapple literally
766000	768000	what's that pineapple been so cute for
768000	770000	the average is 1,800
770000	772000	are you wearing clothes in the artwork
772000	774000	uh
774000	776000	no really not really
776000	778000	no not in the artwork
778000	780000	no average score is 2k
780000	782000	I don't know your main goal at least
782000	784000	at least get one watermelon
784000	786000	literally it's the best meme I don't know
786000	788000	why people are sick of it I don't care I get spammed
788000	790000	everywhere I love watermelon
792000	794000	okay let me finish my cup of tea
794000	796000	whilst I leak company
796000	798000	secrets as I always do
798000	800000	the clipping program
800000	802000	has been green lit for $2
802000	804000	per 1000 views
804000	806000	there is a cap
806000	808000	at 100k
808000	810000	so the maximum money you could make
810000	812000	from a clip is $200
812000	814000	however if that clip
814000	816000	for some reason like blew the fuck up
816000	818000	I need to rate it out
818000	820000	in a specific way where it's like you get more
820000	822000	money if it blows up but it has to reach a
822000	824000	milestone so like 250k
824000	826000	and then you'd get a payout for that
826000	828000	and clips are like obviously clips
828000	830000	need to have a timer on them
830000	832000	however we do have exceptions for
832000	834000	algorithm clips so clips that get
834000	836000	picked up in the algorithm mean
836000	838000	they weren't picked up at the start but maybe
838000	840000	3 months down the line it randomly got
840000	842000	we have an exception for that
844000	846000	so I am in the
846000	848000	process of
848000	850000	hold on I can play one handed
850000	852000	and drink tea and leak company secrets
852000	854000	I love this game
854000	856000	oh I missed
856000	858000	oh no
858000	860000	can I like force it to touch that one

1212000	1214000	I don't know where I went horribly wrong
1214000	1216000	I mean
1216000	1218000	no
1218000	1220000	why are you going all the way over there

1224000	1226000	do I make myself clear
1226000	1228000	don't you dare roll away
1228000	1230000	I literally went halfway
1230000	1232000	across the map
1232000	1234000	vealer's suica arc
1234000	1236000	I think emmy has a switch as well
1236000	1238000	so
1238000	1240000	she wants a cam stream
1240000	1242000	like so whenever I finish a game
1242000	1244000	always taping like a little review
1244000	1246000	in the discord and I'm like hey guys
1246000	1248000	this was a two over experience
1248000	1250000	this is what happened in the game
1250000	1252000	it was just a fun and a goof and a gaffe
1252000	1254000	basically and I'm like I'm sure
1254000	1256000	they're probably sick of it they're like
1256000	1258000	oh we get it strongy
1258000	1260000	shut off about your damn game
1260000	1262000	but like always review them and I'm like
1262000	1264000	oh if you want a chill game experience
1264000	1266000	I was picking my schedule
1266000	1268000	for when my dad goes home
1268000	1270000	and to avoid all the depression
1270000	1272000	and I picked lego lord of the rings
1272000	1274000	to cheer me up
1274000	1276000	so don't be surprised
1276000	1278000	when you see lego
1278000	1280000	rollie pollie's away literally
1280000	1282000	strongy vs emmy suica
1282000	1284000	addition yes suica
1284000	1286000	or suica
1286000	1288000	yes I'm literally between lego lord
1288000	1290000	of the ring I'm so excited
1290000	1292000	we will eventually see
1292000	1294000	strongy in a steam
1294000	1296000	game review
1296000	1298000	I wanted to do an indie game review
1298000	1300000	series where we give like
1300000	1302000	indies a shot because like
1302000	1304000	sometimes all you need is
1304000	1306000	like you know what
1306000	1308000	you know what an example is among us is an example
1308000	1310000	of like someone
1310000	1312000	picking up a game if you didn't know
1312000	1314000	among us came out and it wasn't
1314000	1316000	even that popular like at all
1316000	1318000	and
1318000	1320000	I don't know if that's a terrible idea
1320000	1322000	oh I've done it now
1322000	1324000	I've done it now that was a
1324000	1326000	terrible idea don't ever do that again
1326000	1328000	I'm sorry are you squidding me right now
1328000	1330000	touch
1330000	1332000	touch
1332000	1334000	touch
1334000	1336000	touch touch
1336000	1338000	more people need to
1338000	1340000	write reviews on streams from the
1340000	1342000	perspective of a streamer the
1342000	1344000	veiler game jam when
1344000	1346000	real or
1346000	1348000	steamer game
1348000	1350000	be sucky to be
1350000	1352000	sweet
1352000	1354000	is lego lord of the rings the same level of quality
1354000	1356000	as old star wars yes
1356000	1358000	I literally
1358000	1360000	this sounds really sad but I remember
1360000	1362000	where all the items are hidden and everything
1362000	1364000	and the maps are so what we're going to do
1364000	1366000	when we play lego lord of the rings is
1366000	1368000	I'm going to play through the entire campaign
1368000	1370000	and then we're going to go back and pick up
1370000	1372000	all the stuff because I know where everything is
1372000	1374000	why am I throwing am I throwing
1374000	1376000	why did that work out the game
1376000	1378000	just let me throw
1378000	1380000	oh my god I love when the game lets you throw
1380000	1382000	and it like bails you out randomly
1382000	1384000	pansley gameplay oh yeah
1384000	1386000	pansley's go up
1386000	1388000	august 1st the girls get access
1388000	1390000	actually on the last day
1390000	1392000	of this month
1392000	1394000	and it's up to them how much they want to do
1394000	1396000	and they keep 100% of their cut
1396000	1398000	because veiler did not specify they had to stream
1398000	1400000	on that website so we don't take anything
1400000	1402000	so if you want to support them you may support
1402000	1404000	away have you tried
1404000	1406000	shadow of mordor
1406000	1408000	I thought I did I looked at gameplay
1408000	1410000	I think I must have played a demo or something
1410000	1412000	so we're actually going to play that
1412000	1414000	for the first time yeah we got pizza already
1414000	1416000	we're going to play
1416000	1418000	it's technically for the first time but I am
1418000	1420000	familiar with the mechanics I mean we'll find out
1420000	1422000	on the day when I play honestly right let me finish
1422000	1424000	this team before it gets freaking freezing cold
1426000	1428000	well anyone be posting links
1428000	1430000	the names are already taken exactly
1430000	1432000	as found so you don't really need to dig
1432000	1434000	you'll see them and use their alternative
1434000	1436000	twers anonymous thank you for the tip
1436000	1438000	I was rewatching
1438000	1440000	the yumi plus concert reaction and the thought
1440000	1442000	came to my head I can imagine
1442000	1444000	scrawny going on a hype rock rampage
1444000	1446000	singing
1446000	1448000	songs by my chemical romance
1448000	1450000	she be caught in bumps sounds like she would
1450000	1452000	enjoy singing R&B
1452000	1454000	we were we're going to talk
1454000	1456000	about it in the meeting
1456000	1458000	I don't think it would be cute
1458000	1460000	but I did not know this
1460000	1462000	emi has insane
1462000	1464000	stage fright when it comes to singing
1464000	1466000	I didn't know
1466000	1468000	I thought she was joking
1468000	1470000	em because she like put a little
1470000	1472000	cute message because we have dm's
1472000	1474000	with yumi plus like all the girls in yumi plus
1474000	1476000	they're all sorry let me finish my tea holy crap
1476000	1478000	I can't keep rambling it's going to go freezing
1480000	1482000	what do you think of bandsley versus patreon
1482000	1484000	patreon is a staple
1484000	1486000	income source whereas bandsley is not for the girls
1486000	1488000	so I obviously
1488000	1490000	I'm biased if you want to support the girls
1490000	1492000	doing it via patreon
1492000	1494000	I've got an azeria update actually
1494000	1496000	I need permission to talk about it
1496000	1498000	if she's still with it or not hold on
1498000	1500000	are you cool with me
1500000	1502000	talking about
1508000	1510000	I actually have a collab
1510000	1512000	with azeria today so I hope you're not sick of her
1512000	1514000	because I get to play with her today
1518000	1520000	okay
1528000	1530000	I don't know a good place to put these down
1536000	1538000	I don't even did I do that
1538000	1540000	I feel like the game did that for me
1540000	1542000	I feel like the game has like a tiny little
1542000	1544000	magnet that gives you a
1544000	1546000	who goes there a few pixels of like relief
1546000	1548000	because that's insane
1548000	1550000	what's going on here
1550000	1552000	I've got
1552000	1554000	apparently azeria shorts
1554000	1556000	are about to come through tomorrow and I'm freaking
1556000	1558000	humping this screen
1558000	1560000	because azeria has like hilarious shorts
1560000	1562000	coming through
1562000	1564000	emmy oh my god right sorry
1564000	1566000	I keep mentioning emmy
1566000	1568000	she like she'll send me shorts
1568000	1570000	and it's literally emmy and denpa talking
1570000	1572000	about cheese
1572000	1574000	and I'm like emmy what do you want me to do
1574000	1576000	with this clip how am I supposed to turn it
1576000	1578000	into something that's appropriate

2364000	2366000	what
2366000	2368000	I'm sure there's like a good tactic I haven't solved it yet
2368000	2370000	I mean
2370000	2372000	it's alright I would say the game
2372000	2374000	is fun when you're winning
2374000	2376000	but when the game looks like you're not really getting
2376000	2378000	anywhere it's just kind of like
2378000	2380000	ahh
2380000	2382000	I missed oh
2382000	2384000	you cheated you made it look like
2384000	2386000	you were gonna be a thing
2386000	2388000	you think you did
2388000	2390000	anonymous what do you say I gotta be funny
2390000	2392000	if all the reeflings wrote wholesome messages to pathastronic
2392000	2394000	so he doesn't have to worry his daughter's
2394000	2396000	fans aren't treating her right no he's
2396000	2398000	fine with you guys I think he's
2398000	2400000	actually gonna write a letter for you
2400000	2402000	so that I get to read but I'm only allowed to
2402000	2404000	read it when he's away I'll probably end up crying
2404000	2406000	impressive she stayed
2406000	2408000	relatively calm you having fun
2408000	2410000	it's amy it's alright
2410000	2412000	I don't know
2412000	2414000	maybe it's just kind of one of those games
2414000	2416000	because I just remember
2416000	2418000	it came out and
2418000	2420000	everywhere you looked
2420000	2422000	it did not matter who you looked at
2422000	2424000	they were sitting on this game challenging
2424000	2426000	each although that was actually probably the fun
2426000	2428000	of it challenging each other to like
2428000	2430000	oh if you get
2430000	2432000	cherries please touch
2432000	2434000	if you get like
2434000	2436000	X amount of
2436000	2438000	you know
2438000	2440000	addiction yes basically
2442000	2444000	and the lyrics limit biscuit
2444000	2446000	Lauren unironically rames the word here
2446000	2448000	with the word here literal
2448000	2450000	lyrical crime
2450000	2452000	yeah the competitiveness
2452000	2454000	I just remember everyone was like oh this is
2454000	2456000	my score beat it and then everyone was
2456000	2458000	like today we're going to be in the score
2458000	2460000	and I think that's where
2460000	2462000	the fun of it came in
2462000	2464000	I don't know maybe I'm allowed to set it
2464000	2466000	and then I'll challenge the girls because I know
2466000	2468000	emmy's got a switch
2468000	2470000	ac just got a switch
2470000	2472000	oh that was it oh my god sorry the minute though
2472000	2474000	it's a bit satisfying hold on a minute this game
2474000	2476000	hold on hold on I was a bit hasty in my review
2476000	2478000	that was rather satisfying
2478000	2480000	um
2480000	2482000	oh I just blocked myself off
2482000	2484000	and it doesn't matter because it just
2484000	2486000	bounced halfway across the map that's fine
2486000	2488000	I didn't want that anyway
2488000	2490000	um
2490000	2492000	oh okay we've got a peach
2492000	2494000	we've got a peach

2498000	2500000	stop you guys
2500000	2502000	someone said that they said they were playing a game
2502000	2504000	alongside me and they had
2504000	2506000	beat it like three times over by the time
2506000	2508000	I won my first attempt at it I can't remember
2508000	2510000	what game it was and I was like
2510000	2512000	are you literally sniping the game
2512000	2514000	and doing like ten times better than me
2514000	2516000	um I was absolutely
2516000	2518000	he hot and at the
2518000	2520000	concept you're just doing like way better and being like
2520000	2522000	right hurry up streamer come on
2522000	2524000	strongy we're waiting for the result
2524000	2526000	um

2528000	2530000	we're gonna match you
2530000	2532000	watermelon for melon honestly
2532000	2534000	right I've got two peaches
2534000	2536000	I don't know how to make them kiss
2538000	2540000	see I don't know how to just
2540000	2542000	I keep doing that I keep going
2542000	2544000	oh there's enough room there's not enough room
2544000	2546000	strongy please please
2546000	2548000	there's not enough room
2552000	2554000	I don't know why something
2554000	2556000	oh I don't know sometimes it'll
2556000	2558000	move in the oh come on
2558000	2560000	no
2560000	2562000	say it ain't so
2562000	2564000	I will not go
2564000	2566000	turn the lights
2566000	2568000	oh they kiss
2568000	2570000	was it valid true it might have been
2570000	2572000	it might have been because I checked
2572000	2574000	my marshmallows after stream and you guys always
2574000	2576000	say such nice things I'm so sorry to worry
2576000	2578000	you guys again I had loads of marshmallows
2578000	2580000	that were like are you alive
2580000	2582000	I literally passed out after stream
2582000	2584000	I was so weak
2584000	2586000	in frail
2586000	2588000	I had this fruit juice in the fridge
2588000	2590000	so I opened that up and like
2590000	2592000	took a few sips and then passed out
2592000	2594000	and I think it was like low I hadn't
2594000	2596000	had anything to eat I'd just
2596000	2598000	woken up I didn't stretch I haven't
2598000	2600000	exercised in ages
2600000	2602000	um like all of those factors
2602000	2604000	came together at the same time
2604000	2606000	and it was like ooh shouldn't have done that
2606000	2608000	by the way
2608000	2610000	I had a really fun time on the stream though
2610000	2612000	like I enjoy Ring Fit I like
2612000	2614000	that it's different I like that I can move around
2614000	2616000	I think it would be a lot more
2616000	2618000	effective if it was a 3D stream
2618000	2620000	like a 3D model stream
2620000	2622000	things are gonna have to start
2622000	2624000	kissing or I'm gonna be in trouble
2626000	2628000	I think I'm in trouble things aren't kissing
2632000	2634000	okay but again same
2634000	2636000	problem things aren't kissing
2638000	2640000	unless we
2640000	2642000	force them to kiss
2642000	2644000	no I'm just
2644000	2646000	creating a gap and now I've created a problem
2646000	2648000	I've created a monster
2648000	2650000	nobody wants to see Marshall no more
2650000	2652000	he's top level
2652000	2654000	Ring Fit can never harm you again
2654000	2656000	well like everyone was like
2656000	2658000	oh my god your heart rate and I'm like

2670000	2672000	about my heart rate it's normal for me

3098000	3100000	are we going to do that
3100000	3102000	but how it did
3102000	3104000	I can't remember
3104000	3106000	sukyo is a drug in Japan
3106000	3108000	I wonder if it's because it's like such
3108000	3110000	a nice casual experience like you don't
3110000	3112000	have to try hard it's not like you log in
3112000	3114000	you like waste all your like progression
3114000	3116000	or whatever it's not like that
3116000	3118000	it's just like you can open it up
3118000	3120000	sit down and have a
3120000	3122000	just some casual fun honestly
3122000	3124000	so I was a bit folk or so mean about casual gamers
3124000	3126000	but
3126000	3128000	casual gamers are eating well sorry they are
3128000	3130000	like
3130000	3132000	maybe we were too hasty
3132000	3134000	maybe we shouldn't have judged
3134000	3136000	I can't tell if gimli just meowed
3136000	3138000	or there's
3138000	3140000	a note in this game that sounded like a cat meowing
3140000	3142000	in my brains like gimli
3142000	3144000	right we'll put the orange here
3144000	3146000	cause we're gonna get I know oh well
3148000	3150000	talk about hashtag predictions
3150000	3152000	okay there's an orange there
3152000	3154000	then we do that
3154000	3156000	and then we do this one
3156000	3158000	and then we do this one
3158000	3160000	and then put orange here
3160000	3162000	and then we've got yellow
3166000	3168000	it's like match three games in facebook
3168000	3170000	mums stop that
3172000	3174000	that's a little too real
3178000	3180000	remember when the statistics came out about
3180000	3182000	who's the biggest populace in gaming
3182000	3184000	and it was like
3184000	3186000	because of like games like farmville
3186000	3188000	and candy crush
3188000	3190000	women overall are like the biggest
3190000	3192000	player base
3192000	3194000	because of those statistics
3194000	3196000	I remember reading it and it was like
3196000	3198000	oh my
3198000	3200000	what happened
3200000	3202000	I don't know what happened but I'll take it
3202000	3204000	and it was like oh my god
3204000	3206000	I can't believe it
3206000	3208000	it was like women over four
3208000	3210000	are the biggest gamer
3210000	3212000	literally and I was like holy shit
3212000	3214000	we need to like level up gamers
3214000	3216000	holy crap
3218000	3220000	that's so cute
3220000	3222000	okay we already got telly
3222000	3224000	we orange
3224000	3226000	becomes other orange
3226000	3228000	then orange and orange becomes cherry
3228000	3230000	becomes lemon
3230000	3232000	let them get up
3232000	3234000	let them get up
3234000	3236000	right we're gonna put the purple here
3236000	3238000	and then we're gonna put the orange here
3238000	3240000	and then we're gonna put the grape here
3240000	3242000	you're not grape you're a strawberry
3242000	3244000	oh no I don't want to
3244000	3246000	separate them too much and then two oranges
3246000	3248000	make a telly and then an orange
3248000	3250000	okay I think I'm getting the order
3250000	3252000	things a little bit
3252000	3254000	it'd be better
3254000	3256000	but
3256000	3258000	I'm getting it maybe
3258000	3260000	I'll speak a little too soon but if you
3260000	3262000	wow
3262000	3264000	you're not a real gamer if you don't speak too
3264000	3266000	I'm strategising
3266000	3268000	only match two if you dare
3268000	3270000	my mum was really good at tetris and when she found the tetris battle royale game
3270000	3272000	she was hurt honestly
3272000	3274000	I would know my mum plays
3274000	3276000	those whenever she has downtime
3276000	3278000	and developed a worse gaming addiction
3278000	3280000	than me
3280000	3282000	I think the sims doesn't count as games
3282000	3284000	oh that is the hot take
3284000	3286000	I
3286000	3288000	kinda used to be like that
3288000	3290000	where I was like oh that's not a real game
3290000	3292000	but then I was like you know what
3292000	3294000	let people have fun
3294000	3296000	like
3296000	3298000	if people are happy playing a game I'm just happy
3298000	3300000	they kinda have like something
3300000	3302000	they have something like downtime wise
3302000	3304000	I think I don't know I just think it's sweet
3304000	3306000	I just think it's nice
3310000	3312000	okay
3312000	3314000	what did that do for me
3314000	3316000	exactly
3320000	3322000	that is exactly
3322000	3324000	why I didn't want to put that damn cherry there
3324000	3326000	it's pushing the peach up though
3326000	3328000	okay
3330000	3332000	okay some things are
3332000	3334000	moving
3336000	3338000	I don't know if I want to put it inside there
3338000	3340000	that's what she said
3340000	3342000	don't say such things
3342000	3344000	it's first thing in the morning in refland
3344000	3346000	don't say such things
3346000	3348000	okay there I think that was probably the better idea
3348000	3350000	rather than to separate
3350000	3352000	oh no
3358000	3360000	put the orange there
3362000	3364000	all according to plan
3364000	3366000	I can't believe we're literally strategizing
3366000	3368000	on a freaking fruit game
3370000	3372000	right if those two
3372000	3374000	cherries can kiss up there
3374000	3376000	that would be cute
3376000	3378000	what was if he kissed
3378000	3380000	what was if he did wiggle of kitten
3380000	3382000	the sims isn't giving every girl all 400
3382000	3384000	US dollars worth it
3384000	3386000	bruh I think his are paid for the DLC
3386000	3388000	and I was like are you joking me
3388000	3390000	just fucking message me next time a DLC comes out
3390000	3392000	oh wait she said hi to me
3392000	3394000	she said hi to me in the end
3396000	3398000	okay
3402000	3404000	one second
3408000	3410000	okay everything's fine
3410000	3412000	I thought something went
3412000	3414000	exploded no I'm just kidding
3414000	3416000	right let's try again focus up
3416000	3418000	we are gamers
3418000	3420000	we know how to game
3420000	3422000	for the most part
3422000	3424000	stop giving me the wee ones
3424000	3426000	please
3428000	3430000	if I wanted them to go there
3430000	3432000	I would have put them there
3432000	3434000	not the cherry that accidentally
3434000	3436000	fell down there blocking
3436000	3438000	the big apple
3438000	3440000	come on
3440000	3442000	I thought this game was supposed to be easy
3444000	3446000	your gamers still have leveled up
3446000	3448000	gain strategizing well I've literally just backfired
3448000	3450000	in 4k how dare you curse me
3450000	3452000	right now
3452000	3454000	literally just backfired horrifically
3454000	3456000	right you too
3456000	3458000	finally right if those peaches can kiss
3458000	3460000	please kiss

3462000	3464000	mochi balls mochi balls
3464000	3466000	mochi balls
3466000	3468000	gotta catch them all
3470000	3472000	that's not what that is
3472000	3474000	right okay
3474000	3476000	okay okay
3476000	3478000	okay let them get up let them get up let them get up
3478000	3480000	stop
3480000	3482000	giving me cherries and strawberries
3482000	3484000	sorry I'm about to become cherries in 4k
3486000	3488000	it keeps giving me the wee ones
3488000	3490000	which makes my game harder
3492000	3494000	stop
3494000	3496000	getting me the wee ends
3498000	3500000	right I'm gonna put this here
3500000	3502000	and then I'm gonna roll
3502000	3504000	oh well I literally ruled the orange thing
3504000	3506000	right
3506000	3508000	what does that mean
3512000	3514000	what does it mean
3514000	3516000	will someone please
3516000	3518000	think about what it means
3518000	3520000	okay there's things moving
3520000	3522000	you're allowed to move
3522000	3524000	I give you permission to move
3524000	3526000	just as I give you permission to breathe
3526000	3528000	right that's gonna create an apple
3528000	3530000	on the top left
3530000	3532000	if that apple kisses a lemon
3532000	3534000	it becomes a peach which kisses that peach there
3534000	3536000	so that's fine
3536000	3538000	so we're gonna put an orange here
3538000	3540000	on purpose
3540000	3542000	and then we're gonna roll
3542000	3544000	for an orange
3544000	3546000	wait
3546000	3548000	oh
3548000	3550000	why am I born like

3558000	3560000	I don't know
3560000	3562000	why I'm born like that
3562000	3564000	seriously I literally say the strategy out loud
3564000	3566000	and then my brain's like do you want to do this
3566000	3568000	and I'm like sure
3568000	3570000	no
3570000	3572000	stop

4090000	4092000	I know I was so scuffed
4092000	4094000	I was so scuffed I was the only way I could figure out
4094000	4096000	how to be able to see my stream
4096000	4098000	whilst I play the game
4098000	4100000	and capture it to you at the same time
4100000	4102000	but it's not freaking full screen anymore
4104000	4106000	I think I'm just gonna have to manually capture it

4356000	4358000	the kiss
4360000	4362000	a few of you have been
4362000	4364000	confessing in my marshmallow that you get a bone bone when I kiss
4364000	4366000	and I'm like you shouldn't have told me that
4366000	4368000	I've got too much power now
4368000	4370000	okay
4370000	4372000	you've given me too much power

4392000	4394000	to me
4394000	4396000	and leave me like questions about stuff
4396000	4398000	you want me to answer
4398000	4400000	or things you would like me to do for the girls
4400000	4402000	that kind of thing
4402000	4404000	or stuff that you would like to look out for
4404000	4406000	or look forward to
4406000	4408000	or stream suggestions as well
4408000	4410000	you can like straight up tell me what you want me to play
4410000	4412000	a lot of
4412000	4414000	reeflings may not realise that you guys
4414000	4416000	actually I can't believe I'm gonna say this
4416000	4418000	your guys' opinion
4418000	4420000	squeezed me quite strongly
4420000	4422000	I'm not gonna lie
4422000	4424000	you guys
4424000	4426000	opinionated

4428000	4430000	sorry don't jinx it
4430000	4432000	if I put a cherry here
4432000	4434000	that's fine
4438000	4440000	I'm gonna have to sacrifice
4442000	4444000	oh I need to think
4446000	4448000	I'm actually having to use my
4448000	4450000	oh no things start moving my plan goes out the window

4460000	4462000	be the sacrifice side now
4464000	4466000	unless I put the orange one there
4468000	4470000	no why would you do something
4470000	4472000	like that
4472000	4474000	why would you betray me like that
4474000	4476000	I'm strategising so hard right now
4476000	4478000	and this is how you repay me
4478000	4480000	this is how you repay me
4480000	4482000	I'm actually getting trolled in this game
4482000	4484000	we have influence
4484000	4486000	reeflings stay winning

4628000	4630000	effort and work
4630000	4632000	to get nowhere and in the end

4724000	4726000	I literally you know that little
4726000	4728000	I sounded like one of those

4730000	4732000	Star Wars please tell me
4732000	4734000	you guys heard that too the wee thing that goes
4734000	4736000	wow

4738000	4740000	called yeah clap clap kiss
4740000	4742000	oh I kill me
4742000	4744000	they're not called one for that so the hairy
4744000	4746000	tusky things that look like
4746000	4748000	um
4748000	4750000	willy mammoths but different
4750000	4752000	this is probably been said before
4752000	4754000	but the hair pattern activating when the avatar
4754000	4756000	bugs is kinda crazy oh it's my sleep toggle
4756000	4758000	are you ready
4758000	4760000	this is my sleep toggle
4760000	4762000	when I go to sleep
4762000	4764000	I hypnotize you so you don't attack me
4764000	4766000	because I'm a cuttlefish and I'm actually quite edible
4766000	4768000	if you want to get really technical
4768000	4770000	but that's my sleep
4770000	4772000	but I can put I can manually put my hair
4772000	4774000	on my hypno pattern
4776000	4778000	hi I'm
4778000	4780000	I'm a cuttlefish by the way I know
4780000	4782000	I don't know hypnosis often but I promise
4782000	4784000	I'm working on it I just need time
4784000	4786000	I'm working on my hypnosis stream
4788000	4790000	did you just leak that you're doing a stream
4790000	4792000	dedicated to hypnosis yes I did
4792000	4794000	I'm writing a script
4794000	4796000	for it so I don't mess up though
4796000	4798000	okay let's sweat
4798000	4800000	let's sweat I wanna make you sweat
4802000	4804000	I will say one thing against this game
4804000	4806000	I am gonna slander this game slightly
4806000	4808000	so if this is your favourite game please do close
4808000	4810000	your ear holes
4810000	4812000	it's only fun when things are going
4812000	4814000	your way but when things aren't going your way
4814000	4816000	it's just frustrating
4816000	4818000	oh my god
4818000	4820000	actually that just
4820000	4822000	reminded me I saw a comment on my YouTube
4822000	4824000	this morning someone went
4824000	4826000	this is the most casual Elden Ring player
4826000	4828000	I've ever seen and obviously
4828000	4830000	it was a stream where I was summoning all you guys
4830000	4832000	in to do the work and I'm like
4832000	4834000	oh well yeah that's kind of the point
4834000	4836000	I get to have fun with my reeflings
4836000	4838000	I was giggling I'm sure
4838000	4840000	they were like oh my god let's see if this VTuber
4840000	4842000	is any good at Elden Ring
4842000	4844000	maybe and like hi reeflings
4844000	4846000	can the reeflings do it
4846000	4848000	oh you can do it like halfway across the map
4848000	4850000	with my crossbow ball spraying
4850000	4852000	and missing everything
4852000	4854000	honestly I was giggling away
4854000	4856000	I was like brrr you've come to the wrong streamer
4856000	4858000	if you're looking for skills
4860000	4862000	literally making reeflings play the game for it
4862000	4864000	whilst I'm like shoving food in my face
4864000	4866000	my favourite is that a reefling
4866000	4868000	gave me that crossbow ball that sprays
4868000	4870000	and then I missed all my shots
4870000	4872000	but won
4872000	4874000	and like you guys were giving me like
4874000	4876000	runes to level up in that
4876000	4878000	I think when we go back to Elden Ring
4878000	4880000	we'll play the base game to activate Ranny
4880000	4882000	and then
4882000	4884000	we'll go and do the DLC
4884000	4886000	and enjoy it because I was kind of speedrunning through it
4886000	4888000	I didn't mean to speedrun through it
4888000	4890000	but just like
4890000	4892000	I knew we were up against the Vaude
4892000	4894000	at 12 hours so I'm like
4894000	4896000	okay what's next show me what's next
4896000	4898000	reeflings type thing
4898000	4900000	but I think we need to maybe slow it down
4900000	4902000	and enjoy ourselves
4902000	4904000	like I said we're not in a major rush
4906000	4908000	as if those are crisscross applesauce
4908000	4910000	and right now
4910000	4912000	right I've got orange
4914000	4916000	I'm wondering
4916000	4918000	I bet you if I just spammed down the middle
4918000	4920000	I'd actually get more points than
4920000	4922000	when I actually try hard in the game
4922000	4924000	I'm looking forward to more Elden Ring
4924000	4926000	I'm glad you are
4926000	4928000	yeah
4928000	4930000	I am looking forward to
4930000	4932000	doing the DLC
4932000	4934000	more of it because
4934000	4936000	I don't actually know what's up ahead
4936000	4938000	all in all in those
4938000	4940000	like the classic lines like put these
4940000	4942000	full of shambushes to rest
4942000	4944000	just popping in real quick
4944000	4946000	I'm doing shit but I'm in the game
4946000	4948000	I'm doing absolutely amazing in real life
4948000	4950000	although I'm a bit sad because
4950000	4952000	my dad's going home
4952000	4954000	soon and it feels like we've not
4954000	4956000	really done anything fun together
4956000	4958000	like we've been to cafes
4958000	4960000	we've been on a few car journeys
4960000	4962000	but like the weather's
4962000	4964000	absolute rubbish
4964000	4966000	like it is rubbish
4966000	4968000	we're capital R
4968000	4970000	and
4970000	4972000	so we haven't really been able to do anything
4972000	4974000	and it just feels
4974000	4976000	not like it's a waste because he gets
4976000	4978000	like a holiday offer working that
4978000	4980000	but yeah it's just a bit
4980000	4982000	he wants me to learn to drive
4982000	4984000	like excuse me
4984000	4986000	every time
4986000	4988000	do you not see my amazing bike out there
4988000	4990000	that bike cost me like
4990000	4992000	300 dollars and it doesn't
4992000	4994000	cost any fuel
4994000	4996000	I don't have to do maintenance I don't have to pay road tax
4996000	4998000	like I'm sorry but why would I learn to
4998000	5000000	drive when my bike gets me from A to B
5000000	5002000	so I'm actually a bike simp I don't care what anyone says
5002000	5004000	I'm here for my bike
5004000	5006000	I love my bike I love riding bikes
5006000	5008000	okay I said it
5008000	5010000	I said it I love
5010000	5012000	I freaking love my bike I do
5012000	5014000	it makes me happy
5014000	5016000	okay
5016000	5018000	so no it's those papa cuttles
5018000	5020000	but I'm legit not learning to drive
5020000	5022000	I'm reading I miss trains
5022000	5024000	she's just like me for real for real
5024000	5026000	I'm sorry I'm like so much fun on my bike
5026000	5028000	and like I get to feel the wind through my hair
5028000	5030000	and I get to like I don't know
5030000	5032000	I think I appreciate it because I'm aware that like
5032000	5034000	not everyone's in good enough health to like ride
5034000	5036000	a bike and I get to like have a fantastic
5036000	5038000	time like the wind sweeps
5038000	5040000	through my hair I get from A to B like so fast
5040000	5042000	I don't have to like
5042000	5044000	be on like I don't go on roads
5044000	5046000	because it's too dangerous for me to be on a road
5046000	5048000	so as illegit as even on the bike I would get
5048000	5050000	mowed down in like milliseconds
5050000	5052000	and because I'm just so bad
5052000	5054000	oh that was I didn't even
5054000	5056000	I'm just rambling I'm being honest
5056000	5058000	I'm not really playing right now
5058000	5060000	and
5060000	5062000	like I'd literally get hit by a car
5062000	5064000	so quickly if I was on the road so I'm not
5064000	5066000	and I go on the pavements okay I said what

5452000	5454000	okay
5458000	5460000	okay right I was gonna say
5460000	5462000	right I'm kinda glad that I threw there
5462000	5464000	I didn't mean to throw I meant to push that apple to the side
5464000	5466000	so it would come together
5466000	5468000	no way
5468000	5470000	no way
5470000	5472000	that was amazing
5476000	5478000	oh my god
5478000	5480000	I'm not gonna lie
5480000	5482000	I think that might have actually
5482000	5484000	I'm sorry
5484000	5486000	I'm so sorry
5486000	5488000	can I try that again I wanna try it again
5488000	5490000	but put it in the corner
5490000	5492000	blame RNG
5492000	5494000	honestly I wanna put it in the corner
5494000	5496000	this time
5496000	5498000	1300 points to spam
5498000	5500000	I was literally
5500000	5502000	200 off my third place
5504000	5506000	no way this is the
5506000	5508000	freaking methods
5508000	5510000	I refuse
5510000	5512000	just spam it down
5512000	5514000	and like here's me try hard
5514000	5516000	in trying to strategize and you're telling me
5516000	5518000	I can just spam and then deal with it on the other end
5518000	5520000	random chance the only thing in this world
5520000	5522000	that is fair and biased
5522000	5524000	it won't be as effective in the corner
5524000	5526000	because there's less randomness for the fruit
5526000	5528000	to sort by size
5528000	5530000	it could be a viable strategy until you get
5530000	5532000	a certain fruit then
5532000	5534000	you can be more strategic
5534000	5536000	accidental
5536000	5538000	sort and strike
5538000	5540000	literally the game's just dealing with itself right now
5540000	5542000	the game's like here let's help out
5544000	5546000	what we at
5546000	5548000	300 okay it looks like the corner doesn't work
5548000	5550000	but the middle seems to work way better
5552000	5554000	yeah the corner isn't
5554000	5556000	like I'll move over
5556000	5558000	if it's gonna
5562000	5564000	no way
5566000	5568000	I'm stunned
5568000	5570000	that's
5570000	5572000	that's outrageous
5572000	5574000	sorry that's legit outrageous
5576000	5578000	okay I'll move
5578000	5580000	to the other corner just not to throw
5580000	5582000	like ray of the end
5582000	5584000	okay
5586000	5588000	okay
5588000	5590000	well I think I'm gonna have to do it in the middle then
5592000	5594000	I'm not allowed to do strategy
5594000	5596000	well she says that she moves it to the side
5598000	5600000	nothing else pot okay
5600000	5602000	literally 800
5604000	5606000	I need to spam over

5616000	5618000	well we're full now

6466000	6468000	only you'll notice things that make you cringe
6468000	6470000	but people will never think about it in their life ever again
6470000	6472000	so don't be afraid to be cringe

6510000	6512000	be free be yourself
6512000	6514000	to be cringe is to be free unironically
6514000	6516000	as I said you're the only person
6516000	6518000	that will ever care
6518000	6520000	and look at yourself through

6602000	6604000	I'm getting embarrassed how much I'm being
6604000	6606000	outplayed by these rankings seriously
6606000	6608000	I mean
6608000	6610000	there's nothing I can do
6610000	6612000	I've made everything worse
6612000	6614000	okay

6616000	6618000	surely I can get watermelon

6626000	6628000	right
6628000	6630000	this method clearly works I don't care
6630000	6632000	what anyone says oh my god they're stacking
6632000	6634000	so pretty
6634000	6636000	I actually enjoyed the way they were stacking
6636000	6638000	just one more just one more
6638000	6640000	give me one more just one
6640000	6642000	more chance

6652000	6654000	scored.mp3
6654000	6656000	literally you could have done worse

6658000	6660000	I think I just suck that this method
6660000	6662000	works so well for me
6662000	6664000	I mean obviously
6664000	6666000	naturally things will start
6666000	6668000	pop a lock in so I guess
6668000	6670000	like it's only bound to happen
6670000	6672000	but it's just like
6672000	6674000	use brain
6674000	6676000	or just have fun
6676000	6678000	spamming
6678000	6680000	and things work out in the end
6680000	6682000	okay maybe not this one the RNG on this one
6682000	6684000	maybe maybe not
6684000	6686000	oh no they oh
6686000	6688000	oh

6700000	6702000	oh yeah it's all coming together
6702000	6704000	it's working what do you mean
6704000	6706000	okay it kind of
6706000	6708000	doesn't work near the end where I have less room

7082000	7084000	you guys weren't supposed to know
7084000	7086000	about it until later but I had the key
7086000	7088000	bindings on my keyboard and I
7088000	7090000	flashed stream like twice
7090000	7092000	in a bikini
7092000	7094000	which was ridiculous
7094000	7096000	because everyone was like
7096000	7098000	someone commented they're like oh yeah you totally meant
7098000	7100000	that by mistake
7100000	7102000	and I was like no motherfucker
7102000	7104000	if I meant that on purpose
7104000	7106000	I would have done it on debut for the easy
7106000	7108000	fucking clips and clicks like
7108000	7110000	you're welcome you know that's when
7110000	7112000	you know it's not fucking staged because I
7112000	7114000	cannot tell you how many vtubers I've seen
7114000	7116000	that staged a debut and then
7116000	7118000	all of a sudden oh no

7120000	7122000	oh it was an accident
7122000	7124000	and it's like obviously for fucking clicks
7124000	7126000	like doesn't it be so obvious
7126000	7128000	I'm sorry
7128000	7130000	but I don't know if it's because I'm Scottish and I'm so cynical
7130000	7132000	sometimes
7132000	7134000	but it's so fucking obvious when someone does that
7134000	7136000	tactic and I'm like bro you're actually
7136000	7138000	you're actually so obvious
7138000	7140000	I don't know why we're pretending otherwise
7140000	7142000	fine just say you're doing it for clicks
7142000	7144000	that's how you have you play the freaking

7966000	7968000	right how would I rate suika
7968000	7970000	um
7970000	7972000	if you want my honest opinion
7972000	7974000	I'm not gonna be playing this again on stream
7974000	7976000	if you want my honest opinion
7976000	7978000	I'm not gonna be playing this off stream either
7978000	7980000	it's fine there's nothing wrong with the game
7980000	7982000	there's absolutely nothing wrong with the game
7982000	7984000	it's just slightly too casual
7984000	7986000	I don't know
7986000	7988000	I say that as if I don't literally get you carrying me
7988000	7990000	in Elden Ring but
7990000	7992000	I have to admit even I'm like
7992000	7994000	I'm squinting me right now
7994000	7996000	I'm squinting me right now
7996000	7998000	I'm squinting me right now
7998000	8000000	it'll settle with looking at your premade ones
8000000	8002000	my premade melons how do
8002000	8004000	how do
8004000	8006000	right so sheebie isn't on but emi might be on later
8006000	8008000	let me just check
8008000	8010000	I'll redirect into her
8010000	8012000	if she isn't on
8012000	8014000	then I will
8014000	8016000	nope she's not on
8016000	8018000	then Azura I will redirect
8018000	8020000	into Azura's room
8024000	8026000	yes okay she does have it off
8026000	8028000	now we might be an hour early
8028000	8030000	but if she's still asleep then it'll be the usual time
8032000	8034000	I know literally sheebie's on vacation
8034000	8036000	so I can't redirect her to her
8036000	8038000	emi's just came back she's getting into the swing of things again
8038000	8040000	there's nothing until you collab with Azura
8040000	8042000	okay yes
8042000	8044000	how are you doing
8046000	8048000	sorry that was a stretch I don't know why I made that so weird
8048000	8050000	maybe I'm just
8050000	8052000	I'm a freak
8054000	8056000	I'm a weird
8056000	8058000	joke I'm a bit of playdough
8058000	8060000	I'm getting ready for carry
8060000	8062000	okay now I'm even freaking got the stream up
8062000	8064000	in the waiting room for it up
8064000	8066000	right I'm gonna redirect into Azura's POV
8066000	8068000	of the collab that's in two hours
8068000	8070000	I'm gonna go lie down for a nap
8070000	8072000	mummy did you ever talk about needing permission for a short
8072000	8074000	yes oh right
8074000	8076000	okay so reflins be completely
8076000	8078000	and wholeheartedly honest
8078000	8080000	you can either use Marshmallow for feedback or not
8080000	8082000	so on the
8082000	8084000	vealer youtube channel
8084000	8086000	the announcement trailer got 100k views
8086000	8088000	the reason
8088000	8090000	that it got picked up in
8090000	8092000	the algorithm
8092000	8094000	is because it was reported
8094000	8096000	by a news channel which
8096000	8098000	is ran by a male
8098000	8100000	and obviously we follow idle culture
8100000	8102000	now I was going to do a behind the scenes
8102000	8104000	talking about how
8104000	8106000	why your
8106000	8108000	VTuber goes nuts when they make the news
8108000	8110000	is because there's a clear correlation
8110000	8112000	of being on VTuber news
8112000	8114000	and then like the views or whatever
8114000	8116000	now I was gonna do a breakdown
8116000	8118000	short about it however
8118000	8120000	I didn't want to do it if it would upset anyone
8120000	8122000	so I do want you to be honest
8122000	8124000	I don't want me to talk about it
8124000	8126000	I'm more than happy to just
8126000	8128000	bend that short idea
8128000	8130000	but it is talking about VTuber news
8130000	8132000	and in particular one
8132000	8134000	that is ran by a guy
8134000	8136000	which is why the vealer
8136000	8138000	announcement trailer of the agency
8138000	8140000	got trending if you can see on the website
8140000	8142000	it's literally got almost 100k views
8142000	8144000	so I just
8144000	8146000	didn't want to do anything that upsets you guys
8146000	8148000	but I was gonna talk about why your VTuber gets excited
8148000	8150000	and then I was gonna show like correlation between
8150000	8152000	the
8152000	8154000	video getting traction
8154000	8156000	where it got mentioned
8156000	8158000	and then why VTubers are so thankful
8158000	8160000	to be mentioned on the news
8160000	8162000	it's alright wait why would we get upset
8162000	8164000	ran by a guy mail on stream
8164000	8166000	I know we're teasing but I just don't want to do
8166000	8168000	anything that would upset you guys
8168000	8170000	but please do use Marshmallow as well
8170000	8172000	if you'd rather give anonymous feedback
8172000	8174000	that's more than anything
8174000	8176000	I'm here for you
8176000	8178000	you do you
8178000	8180000	just because it's a bit more of a behind the scenes
8180000	8182000	on the VTuber aspect than it is
8182000	8184000	about anything else of that degree
8184000	8186000	it sounds okay
8186000	8188000	now if I did it
8188000	8190000	anyone would freak out about that has bigger problems
8190000	8192000	person that sounds like I see no issue
8192000	8194000	yeah it's more like a behind the scenes
8194000	8196000	angle it's not like oh my god
8196000	8198000	slob on the knob like it's nothing like that
8198000	8200000	nah I'm the opposite girls
8200000	8202000	I want to see men
8202000	8204000	hmm
8206000	8208000	it's okay right as long as you guys are sure
8208000	8210000	I'll make sure it's completely
8210000	8212000	above board to the best my ability but again
8212000	8214000	you can use my
8214000	8216000	Marshmallow as well for a bit of feedback
8216000	8218000	but it's not focused
8218000	8220000	around that it's the
8220000	8222000	the subject title is
8222000	8224000	why do VTubers get so
8224000	8226000	excited being mentioned in the news
8226000	8228000	and then I was going to explain
8228000	8230000	the Vealer trailer got trending
8230000	8232000	and then I was going to ask some VTubers
8232000	8234000	that have been in the news
8234000	8236000	if they had a correlation
8236000	8238000	as well
8238000	8240000	that knob might sound cool
8240000	8242000	you're overthinking it
8242000	8244000	I just don't want to upset anyone
8244000	8246000	what is Marshmallow
8246000	8248000	Marshmallow is in the link below
8248000	8250000	in the description below
8250000	8252000	and you can send me anonymous
8252000	8254000	remarks now if you don't have Firefox
8254000	8256000	which has an auto translate thing
8256000	8258000	you can add on
8258000	8260000	it's in Japanese
8260000	8262000	in Japanese
8262000	8264000	so what I'm hearing is
8264000	8266000	if you do something newsworthy
8266000	8268000	and have some evidence that mentions
8268000	8270000	Vealer
8270000	8272000	basically Vealer made the news for the first agency
8272000	8274000	and then the trailer
8274000	8276000	got trending because it got mentioned
8276000	8278000	it wasn't trending before
8278000	8280000	originally I was putting advertisement money to show it off
8280000	8282000	but then it wasn't needed
8282000	8284000	go for it the behind the scenes stuff is the best
8284000	8286000	as long as you guys are okay
8286000	8288000	I wonder what news it was
8288000	8290000	Sky News Australia? No
8292000	8294000	I still think there are people who think
8294000	8296000	she talks to Marshmallows during her free time
8298000	8300000	I talk to my Marshmallows
8300000	8302000	I read my Marshmallows
8302000	8304000	actually I do have a request for you guys
8304000	8306000	to send me
8306000	8308000	to send me stuff
8308000	8310000	um
8310000	8312000	um
8312000	8314000	um
8314000	8316000	um
8322000	8324000	um
8324000	8326000	what kind of stuff?
8326000	8328000	um

8330000	8332000	I want to make some twitter
8332000	8334000	audios
8334000	8336000	but I need motivation
8336000	8338000	and record again
8338000	8340000	so if you ever wanted to send
8340000	8342000	some stuff
8342000	8344000	I mean you can't
8344000	8346000	and then I could use it
8348000	8350000	okay
8350000	8352000	I will leave it there
8352000	8354000	I'm gonna redirect into Azur's little waiting room
8354000	8356000	please do watch Azur's P.E.O.V
8356000	8358000	um
8358000	8360000	actually you can watch us both at the same time
8360000	8362000	to see what we're dealing with
8362000	8364000	I'm an idiot you can literally watch them both at the same time
8364000	8366000	since we're only talking to each other
8366000	8368000	um
8368000	8370000	as long as it's not for Gamba
8370000	8372000	nyaaa

8384000	8386000	but the girls get
8386000	8388000	so much more hate words
8388000	8390000	Marshmallows than I do
8390000	8392000	I get like one or two
8392000	8394000	just because I've not been posting on my alt twitter
8394000	8396000	I think if I start posting on my alt twitter
8396000	8398000	then
8398000	8400000	you know I'll start to reap the rewards
8400000	8402000	if you will

8408000	8410000	but yeah if you wanted to be
8410000	8412000	motivational for no particular reason
8412000	8414000	in like a weeks time
8414000	8416000	feel free to use marshmallows
8418000	8420000	I'll keep one on the burger and Gamba
8420000	8422000	and I'll respond to them to get traction
