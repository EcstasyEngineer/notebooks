1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Focus on your life so you can let your dreams come back to you.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, I don't want to play any more.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Go back real.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Save your dreams.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It took 1,000 years to perfect the battle machine.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But it's only a second to pull the trigger.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Last morning, you got the Atlantic Sea?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You don't watch the sea?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You don't watch the sea?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well...

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sorry, game's still out, game's still out.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Return back to the...

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To what? To speak?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh my god. Make phones in my arms.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay. Well good morning.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good evening. Good afternoon.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Have fantastic news.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I slept.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh my god.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I slept.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fucking Christmas party.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Uh...

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I also...

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Also give him an animal.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Give him an animal. Oh.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So now I no longer have the belly of someone that has 5 days old.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Uh...

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Shit.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Basically...

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can we finish the Yumi camp?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sorry, this was a disgusting thing I could probably ever see.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And it's first thing in the morning.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Um...

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Basically started after the Yumi...

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Um...

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh yeah. Oh no, this can't be.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Put me on easy. Come on.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Current levels. Suffer the silence.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't pick anything else.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh no.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh no, this can't be.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Creatin' you? Oh no.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We can only pick make warrior.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We have to do normal difficulty.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We can't just do camp.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right, anyway.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Very quickly summarized what happened.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
After the fantastic Yumi plus collab,

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
which was an absolute hoot and holler,

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
turns out we all love each other.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Um...

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I basically passed out

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
for six hours.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And then I woke up and I was like...

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ugh, my stomach, my stomach.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Ugh, I can't do this anymore.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I give him an innermot

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and I did that.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I ended up...

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I ended up passing out

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
again after that.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I woke up with five minutes to go.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So all in all,

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I ended up sleeping 12 hours.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I woke up with a massive headache.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's not gonna stop me. I'm taking painkillers.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Turns out I am...

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I freaking...

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I accidentally hydrate

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
via my fucking ass.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because it didn't come out at first.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I was like, excuse me?

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Water? Where did you go?

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hmm...

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Um, so that was actually taking room.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Uh...

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The good news is...

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're playing...

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's technically a childhood game,

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but I was actually too weak

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to play this at any point.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I know of,

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you know, all the mech

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
types and all of that.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Because I watched my dad play this game, basically.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So I don't even know if we're gonna successfully

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
get through it, but it doesn't matter.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because we're gonna try our best.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I do have a ASMR

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
membership stream planned.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
As well, at the end of this.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, if we do get hard stuff,

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
uh...

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
My plan is to throw mech

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
assault out the window, and then

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll just do my membership.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Eh...

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Take time for your health.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Literally,

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I kid you not, I should have played this

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
when my...

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When my dad gets here.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because he could unironically...

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He plays...

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Uh, you know what?

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll remember the map when we get on it.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The last map, as Atlas,

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
he absolutely adores

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and the other one, he absolutely adores.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's one where you can, like, level all the buildings.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And...

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, my dad...

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's a wee bit, like,

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
mean, he's a wee bit autistic, but he doesn't realize it.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And he used to play the same map

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
over and over again, and did the exact same thing.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Same thing, over and over again. It's rather adorable.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Can you change the difficulty

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
if you're creating your profile?

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's just, like...

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh my god, axes!

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Viva la France!

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Eh...

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, it doesn't want to do anything.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just stay back facing them.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I mean, I guess...

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Whoa! Okay, I guess I just...

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh wait, current levels

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
suffer this silence.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not much of a sufferage.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm guessing this is, like, corporal

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ranks, because in this mecha game

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you are...

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Um...

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You'll never guess what.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're piloting a mecha!

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ah!

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ah!

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What are the odds?

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Um...

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But yes, sorry, I'm just waking up a wee bit.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, aces!

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Snowberries!

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, I'm piloting a mecha!

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mech asshole!

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh my god!

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is both their fault.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Shut up, Isla.

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll jump in it right now.

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hi!

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Snowberries!

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Guten Morgan!

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm currently slurping on my little teeth.

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then we're going to jump into this game

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
called Mech Assault.

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is an Xbox original!

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Not even Xbox...

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Not even Xbox 360!

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This was an Xbox

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No...

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wait!

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Wait a minute!

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is the early...

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The first mission!

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ooh!

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It has a lady pie!

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hi, AC!

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think she's going to be resting.

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then hi, Snowberries!

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We're playing Mech Assault, we're about to go speak to

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the lady!

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now, you might notice my title is the most bizarre thing

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
you've ever fucking read out of context.

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We took part from the heavy Mechs

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
to fix the Cougar Scout Mech!

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Um, well, yeah!

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wait, what time?

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm going to drink my tea.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hey, sport, you ready?

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've got our orders.

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The invasion still steps off as planned.

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We're not paying us to be late.

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But the best part is that we get to go in first.

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Just like old times.

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The Intel boys say the enemy is powering up

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a set of nasty, ground-to-orbit guns.

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If those are online when the rest of the dragoons arrive,

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
everyone dies.

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And we blow our bonus.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So our little team gets to make a covert landing

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
outside the range of the existing guns,

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
sneak across half a continent,

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and take them out before our dropships show up.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think it's Loki, we play first.

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think it's Loki, we play first.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Me?

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait, is that Logan?

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That makes me call Logan.

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait.

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wait, so that's the intro.

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So then, eating dirt is the first mission.

209
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
All systems normal.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're in the pipe. Touchdown in two minutes.

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh my god. It's like a pixel on my screen.

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We've been scammed.

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Weapon fire inbound.

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Lieutenant Foster, how did they detect us?

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Alpha, Bravo landers.

216
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Prepare to hot-drop.

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want you out of this grave now.

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Brace yourselves, boys. We're going in.

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is this the first mission?

220
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or am I picked the wrong one?

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait, these are...

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wait.

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why does it say select mission,

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and I keep getting fucking...

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The operation is off to a bad start,

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but the Icarus is not granted.

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Our job will be much harder.

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why do I keep getting cutscene?

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, this is the first mission.

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Here's a quick status report.

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Alright, it's Cougar Scout Mac.

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I knew it was Cougar.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I knew it was Cougar Scout Mac,

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
because of this voiceline coming up.

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh.

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, my God.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Holy...

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Holy moly.

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Holy moly.

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, my God.

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, my PC's ready to catch fire

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
because it's kind of...

243
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
weird thing.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay.

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, there's a hidden multiplayer...

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So, this game used to be multiplayer,

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and there's a hidden function in it.

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, yeah, be safe.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's three baddies.

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, my God, my PC's ready to catch fire.

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If I randomly go offline,

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you know exactly what.

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Right.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh.

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are they so brave?

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why are you coming up against them, then?

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Look at the size of me.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, my goodness.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Right.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, the thing about NCT 2

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
is you can just walk on it.

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh.

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh.

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't know if you can hear that.

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They're going up.

266
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh.

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right.

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Next.

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why...

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Why changes?

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay.

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay.

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Next.

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Is that a ship?

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think he's glitched out.

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, right.

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It controls the ammo type by X, Y, and Bravo.

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
A trained mech of work.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Destroy it.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Weapons. Use your left trigger

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to cycle through the weapons,

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
or just...

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's official.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They know we're here and they will be coming for us.

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Coming back for more?

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, my God.

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Be sure to secure any sound that you find.

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The game audio is so loud.

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Ah.

290
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Right.

291
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So, we want music down

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and we want sound down,

293
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
so you guys can actually hear the in-game ending.

294
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How's this?

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know why my mic is acting

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
all quiet all of a sudden.

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's normally like, I'm so freaking loud into it.

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm feeding it through the thing.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
How's that?

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Kind of.

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
How's that louder?

302
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well...

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I see a max gain right now.

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Filters.

305
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Gains.

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay, this is up by 14 decibels now.

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Testing.

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Test tickles.

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Testing the tickles.

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Repeat, testing the tickles.

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, see, these are health pads.

312
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
See that green box?

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's for health.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Maybe we were destined

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
for the longest collab.

316
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, it sounds much better.

317
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Much better.

318
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Test.

319
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can't remember what blues for my ultimate.

320
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No.

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So, if you lose health,

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you can pick up one there.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And then, I guess,

324
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that must be for this.

325
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Again.

326
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, the blue must give infinite.

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, almost.

328
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A new...

329
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Attackable one.

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, you literally step on them.

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
God, this game is actually kind of brutal for its time.

332
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
When you...

333
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yep.

334
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Fucking supply convoy.

335
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, my God, my aimbot.

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
They never told me this game didn't come with aimbot, okay?

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm trying not to get hit by it

338
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
because it's in the necklace.

339
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm spraying.

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, that's the supply convoy already?

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Holy crap.

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, my God.

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't beat him.

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm getting rules.

345
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm getting rules.

346
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Wait.

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why was my dad so much better at this game?

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No, this can't be.

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Fuck the rules.

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay, there we go.

351
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There we go.

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like, I was like, way ahead of me.

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hold on.

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No, there's more.

355
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hold on, there's enemies.

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, no, I'm like half health already

357
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
because I'm getting too ahead of myself.

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Wait, there is aimbot on this one.

359
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay, I'm staying on this one then.

360
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Like, aimuses.

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The AI in this game is brutal.

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let me heal up.

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't make me a bad mech warrior.

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Come on.

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Come on, let me heal up.

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There was the turret.

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Come forward.

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Bro, I'm trying evasive maneuvers.

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They're actually not working.

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm not being funny.

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I can't evasive maneuver and aim at the same time.

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Can you not destroy these?

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You must. Okay, I was going to say you must.

374
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Bro, forget.

375
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
They're leveling me. This is the tutorial.

376
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
My mech is sparking.

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's actually ogre.

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's so ogre when I started.

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
My mech is sparking.

380
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

381
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No.

382
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
My audio is on.

383
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know what the fuck the among us collab did.

384
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know why I'm so quiet.

385
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't fly.

386
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm literally sparking.

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Bro, we're already doing the fucking ace of marching

388
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
before I knew it.

389
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Whoa.

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You?

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay.

392
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, something just shot.

393
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was going to say something just shot.

394
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Wait, hold on.

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I want to use my summer heal.

396
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you, jeez.

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I've got more rocket.

398
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, it's just swapped me a rock.

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, and you pick up the ammo tape.

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It swaps you.

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Fuck.

402
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Stop it.

403
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh my god, I'm actually going to lose.

404
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm actually going to fucking lose.

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Um, this is the tutorial.

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm not even kidding.

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why are freaking video games so brutal?

408
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They did not care about anyone's feelings.

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Honestly, they were like,

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
no, you either win or you lose.

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Fuck you. You have to use this thing again.

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Like, where's most of these fucking things?

413
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Sending a scout unit

414
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and a frontal attack.

415
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Absolutely genius.

416
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And Diego.

417
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Thank you for coming to member.

418
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm to level this city.

419
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I hear a chopper.

420
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why do I hear a chopper?

421
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, it's you.

422
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, this is mean.

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
People are just trying to either.

424
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Can you aim for that?

425
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Whoa.

426
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Who do you think you are?

427
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay, we're going for the health here.

428
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Fuck. I knew there was a man.

429
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, these are...

430
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think these are looking.

431
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, no.

432
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, no.

433
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Give me the fucking health right now.

434
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Where is it?

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

436
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't do this to me.

437
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm actually going to lose this tutorial.

438
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't do this to me.

439
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hold on.

440
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, my God, yes.

441
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, my God.

442
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's auto lock on this fucking gun type.

443
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, my God, please.

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, my God, I'm scared.

445
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No, fuck it. If you fly, I'm flying.

446
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Fuck you.

447
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How many rockets? I've got two more rockets.

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, we got one. We got one.

449
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hold on. You're next.

450
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, we're out.

451
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Are we? Wait.

452
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We have infinite aim bomb.

453
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We have infinite things and I wasn't using it

454
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the entire time.

455
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We have infinite aim bomb.

456
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Missiles.

457
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And I haven't

458
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
been using them.

459
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Right, I need one.

460
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, my God.

461
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Sorry, that guy was literally trying to do a

462
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
freaking development job.

463
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What do I need to destroy?

464
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Head cores.

465
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Man, fuck head cores.

466
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I think there's a hidden item

467
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in one of these buildings, maybe?

468
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm starting to be in blame to the UI.

469
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Literally, I suck.

470
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You have infinite ammo for all weapons.

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Wait, we're just using this one, then.

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Fuck up this building.

473
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Shut up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up.

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Jesus. You've actually got some

475
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
decent HP. I'll give you that, Mr.

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Buildings.

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There's something shooting at me.

478
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Bruh.

479
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Am I not...

480
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Who the fuck is...

481
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I love the love of what...

482
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Ah!

483
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Ah!

484
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh.

485
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Just...

486
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ah!

487
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Wait, and just like that.

488
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Ah, right.

489
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So we did that one.

490
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Never doing last transmission.

491
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Lieutenant, can you get that back?

492
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't, Major. There's nothing to get back.

493
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I see.

494
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Any sign of the rest of Alpha Lance?

495
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No, sir. Captain, get back

496
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
to the Icarus.

497
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
For now, it's just you and that scout mech,

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
but this operation continues.

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like I said, Dragoons

500
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
improvise.

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Right, so we're getting our...

502
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, sorry, you can see that we missed it.

503
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's okay, suffering silence.

504
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Military Defender's ability to

505
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
repel the impending invasion

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
by raising

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
their...

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Home Center.

509
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Again.

510
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And again.

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The loudness difference in this game

512
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is crazy.

513
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Uh-huh.

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Right.

515
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Simple.

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Right, so we've unlocked the Puma,

517
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
but I don't know if it has

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
rockets like the other one.

519
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Right, we'll try with the Puma.

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And if we...

521
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Puma pants,

522
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
because I do so badly with it.

523
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We'll pick another one, thank you.

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Sorry, I took way too long

525
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
on to hit the brim there.

526
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I took way too long

527
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
to do that when I came in that joke,

528
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
so I literally just went shite myself

529
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and then that was the joke. Right, okay.

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
They do seem to have some auto-lock type turret.

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm so sorry.

532
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm so sorry.

533
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But I do like this game because you can like walk into stuff

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and destroy it. Like...

535
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Excuse you!

536
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm just trying to enjoy the spawn area.

537
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's what I'm saying. These older games are brutal.

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like, there's no such thing as like

539
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
spawn area safety or nothing.

540
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I really strongly...

541
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh.

542
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That one just killed his own guy there.

543
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh, there's a brook floor.

544
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh my god,

545
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
he like fires fast.

546
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay, so here's a thing

547
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
that a lot of people didn't know about.

548
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You might notice that

549
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I've got a heat bar on the left.

550
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If you stand in water, your mech cools down.

551
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And a lot of people didn't know this in the multiplayer.

552
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So my dad used to wreck

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and deck in the multiplayer

554
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
like far beyond anyone's...

555
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
like, isn't knowing

556
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
you how he was winning.

557
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And so this was back when Xbox

558
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
headsets, like, were things

559
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
who could communicate with the enemy team

560
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
all points in the game. There were some such things

561
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
like rounds where you can smack top.

562
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, the entire game

563
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
someone was blasting music down the mic.

564
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Someone was like spamming the N word

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
all of that stuff.

566
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And my dad used to wreck and deck

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
on these bit in multiplayer.

568
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And everyone used to be so raging at him.

569
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
They're like, hey, he's cheating. How is he doing that?

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And it was because he was sitting in the water

571
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
on Alice, which is like

572
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
there's really damage in mech.

573
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh.

574
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's like this really

575
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
damaging

576
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
a mech, but

577
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
his cooldown is like pretty

578
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
aggressive.

579
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, god, I'm gonna shut up.

580
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All right, there. I know, those are people.

581
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't really need people right now.

582
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Where the heck did they go? Were they in the air?

583
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm in the air. Fuck you.

584
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
All right, there we go.

585
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So basically,

586
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
my dad used to wreck and deck on multiplayer.

587
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And

588
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the reason why I obviously like, oh, my mom

589
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
was the first E girl.

590
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'd say that is a joke, by the way.

591
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because my mom used to go and

592
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
headset and just like have a talk

593
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
with anyone. Like just like,

594
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a lot of folks that like played mech,

595
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
had Xbox Originals at the time.

596
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You were a working person.

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You had to have internet.

598
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You had to have the actual console,

599
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
which is quite rare in itself. Then you would have to have a game.

600
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So it was a mature

601
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
fan base

602
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
that opted for this game.

603
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And my mom used to go and headset

604
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
pretending like she,

605
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
so my dad used to play the game in fucking silence.

606
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And my mom

607
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
used to like be like, oh, I just got

608
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
here.

609
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And

610
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
my dad would be like, every morning

611
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'd wake up to like a billion pals

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
requests on Xbox.

613
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And it makes me laugh my ass off every

614
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
time they tell me the story.

615
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm like, my mom was the first fucking

616
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
girl being like,

617
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
oh, I just got you.

618
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Like all of that down the make

619
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and like fucking laugh.

620
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's such a shame.

621
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
My mom and dad made pals with

622
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
this guy from Canada.

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But

624
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
it's a shame because like obviously

625
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
they never got like any contact

626
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
details of Xbox. So they never spoke.

627
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But basically he used to get

628
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
high every day and he didn't have a job.

629
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And my mom and

630
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
dad love talking to him because they were like,

631
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
what do you mean you don't have a job?

632
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And there's like, oh, no, I don't need to pay

633
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
taxes and he would like tell them about Canada.

634
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So

635
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Grizzly, if you're out there, my mom and dad

636
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
absolutely adore you still and they still talk

637
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to you to this day. They still remember

638
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
your game or tag Grizzly.

639
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So hopefully you're still getting high

640
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
as hell and telling funny stories

641
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
to people in video games.

642
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Doing Canada

643
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
proud literally.

644
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So if you ever think like, oh,

645
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't have an impact

646
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
anywhere on anyone.

647
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Literally, there's a

648
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Scottish man and wife that still

649
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
to this day talk about their old gamer

650
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
buddy from 20 years gone by.

651
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It must be. I don't know how old this game is

652
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
when they were, wait, can I not?

653
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I doubt you're flying. Coming in boys.

654
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So yeah, don't ever be like, oh,

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
my life doesn't have any impact.

656
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Like there's a

657
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
nostalgic man and woman in

658
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Scotland that still think about you.

659
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So, oh shit, I'm overheating. I can't

660
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
fire.

661
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Hold on, let's get this tank

662
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
first because they're the

663
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
humans.

664
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, when you overheat you

665
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
literally can do no damage, which is

666
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
a bit unfortunate.

667
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Wait, what did I join into?

668
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's the context?

669
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm just saying that even if your life

670
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
doesn't feel like it's impactful or anything

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
like that,

672
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
my parents

673
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
used to play

674
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
meccosal with this

675
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
random guy from Canada. They don't have this

676
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
contact information or anything, but his

677
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
gamer tag was grizzly and I'm just saying

678
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
even if you feel like your life has

679
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
no positive impact, there is

680
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
a sweet Scottish couple to this

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
day that still talk about this guy

682
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
that got high and played meccosal

683
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
every single day from Canada and

684
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
it doesn't, like your life

685
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
doesn't have to amount to anything

686
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
at all. That's not how it works.

687
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And it's just very

688
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I think it's just

689
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, there's a mecc.

690
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yep. Oh, I'm

691
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
seeing a battle mecc. I don't know about reading

692
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
a mecc. I just saw him.

693
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I see him. He's coming at me like a freaking

694
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
spoon.

695
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh.

696
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Whoa, hold on.

697
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Hold on. Is he crippled?

698
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So mecc animations are actually

699
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
pretty decent. You can get crippled mecc

700
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
animations. Oh, fuck. I'm

701
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
overheating and there's no water nearby.

702
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh, there's no water nearby.

703
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm out. I'm overheating.

704
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Hold on. Let me hide behind this building. Hold on.

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hold on, darling. Let me hide behind this

706
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
building. Okay. Okay, darling. Thank you.

707
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Right. I've got a, I can shoot again.

708
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay. He's crippled. See how

709
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
he's sparking? That's when you know that mecc

710
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
is getting weak. Yeah. He's literally on fire.

711
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But you ready for this sound when it dies?

712
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'll shut up when it dies.

713
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh, come on.

714
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Whoa.

715
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm one health. I'm one health in a dream.

716
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm one health in a dream. I'm one health in a

717
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
dream. I wasn't paying attention. Oh, my god.

718
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Holy. There.

719
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Oh, my god.

720
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, my god.

721
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I wasn't paying attention because

722
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I was typically yattin'.

723
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Make Grizzly only the most famous

724
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
YouTuber. Wait,

725
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
YouTuber, shut up. Imagine if it was him and

726
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he's a YouTuber now and I'd be like,

727
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
hi, by the way, I'm the daughter of

728
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
your old best pal

729
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that you used to talk to daily on Xbox.

730
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What the fuck up? Could you imagine?

731
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is there actually someone called Grizzly on

732
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
YouTube that please make games to shut the

733
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
fuck up? Imagine. And he's the Canadian

734
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and he gets high all the time.

735
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I've got some news from my dad.

736
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Oh, my god.

737
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Stony keeping the jet pack

738
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that makes it overheat.

739
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Wait, this meat. Oh, right.

740
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It does add to your overheat. Okay.

741
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh, no.

742
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Whoa.

743
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Wait, are you the real Stony?

744
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, thank you.

745
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Are you kidding me?

746
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm scared to go in.

747
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh, it's you again.

748
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, no, it's not.

749
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, my god.

750
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
They're like sniping me from halfway

751
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
across from that.

752
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And they have all wing.

753
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah

754
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh

755
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I think I'm supposed to have to fight in here because look how many healing stations there are

756
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,720
That's probably also one of the important things is to be able to fall back. Oh my god. We're just trying to hospital a

757
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Geneva convention

758
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Oh

759
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,960
Sometimes I wonder if I ever own some famous folks during my year strongy, please. What do you mean by spoon? What calling on my spoon?

760
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,680
It's just an insult like you can insult things

761
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I really want to use my special ammo

762
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Oh

763
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,720
And in scots you can make inanimate objects and insult

764
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:15,360
Ramblin on about yeah in scots you can make anything an insult an inanimate object an insult. Oh

765
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,340
Oh, we're done. Okay. Maybe there is a chance. We've finished the campaign

766
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,640
Resistance group actively fighting the word of Blake. We've not heard from Alpha Lance so we can use these guys help

767
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,080
We've seen it foster play the transmission. It's pretty rough sir seems to be repeating at short intervals

768
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
I'll let you know when I get a better read

769
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Hey

770
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Did we like I feel like cougar had more

771
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,560
Recon and light and rays from our variation of the cougar is built around the PPC

772
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,080
See, that's only a fucking hit that it makes friends, we'll try we'll try

773
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,520
The Cougar Paul, I know I'm kind of at bias

774
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,920
Yeah, it's an infinite input should be doable. I don't know I almost perished in that last fight because it was making a tension

775
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Thanks

776
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
They're doing civilians

777
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,400
Yeah, on your way civilians or across you with my big Mac

778
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400

00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:04,800
Escape everyone get through the tunnel. No, don't rear end him. He's got insurance to whoa

He really says he's like hurry it on up buddy. I ain't got all day

781
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,400
How big your insurance cost is gonna be astronaut. I have the footage in 4k right now

782
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,280
I'm like one of those people that like chase them down. Whoa

783
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,200
Look what you've done. Look what you've done. You've derailed that poor man. Do you know how much he spends on his wee

784
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,600
freaking car

785
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,640
Yeah, I mean, you know how much his monthly expenses on a car

786
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,480
Shocking and look what you've done. You push that per man at that tunnel. He didn't deserve that. He didn't

787
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Okay, I'm about to get a fight

788
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Looks like a light scout

789
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,960
No, he's cheating. He's in the war. Yeah, the war

790
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Terrorize these

791
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
We's running careful captain

00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,720
Is they actually running he's not he can be

793
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh, wow, I don't think I've ever noticed and I didn't even know they coded the things to run away

794
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,040
He actually is running away. No wait a minute. Hold on you kill civilians

795
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,400
So when someone has a tank that can actually do you look what happens you run away?

796
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,800
I'll get locked this monster on you didn't think I will she's big nice. He's sitting in the water right now ready to

797
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,440
Fuckin hell I'm overheating. Hold on. Let me get in the war

798
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,760
That's I'm cheating. I'm doing I'm doing it literally the strong and stress

799
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:56,400
Oh, come on, I can't see you when you do that hold on the hood says he's above me others

800
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,280
He's right there stop it. He's right there

801
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,840
Oh, come on in book. Come on. You can do it. You can do it. Yes

802
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
What a lovely noise

803
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,040
Juicy I learned it learning the dead stuff looks at least one am shot

804
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,520
Though is that shit, are you targeting me right now?

805
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,520
I've got a cross here on the map that says go this way, but I feel like I'm about to go out of bounds

806
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,600
There doesn't appear to be much in the area

807
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,960
Okay, here we go. We've got some sort of civilization up ahead. Sorry. It's just the render distance

808
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
That's all the render distance. Oh

809
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Oh

810
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,040
Okay, that's honestly when she said that sorry we're doing strats

811
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,500
The music in this game is really good if I could put it off, but I don't know the volume

812
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,240
What's the word?

813
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,520
The volume steadiness in this game is like aged terribly because one minute

814
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,480
The cutscene is like blaringly loud and then the next minute is just awful

815
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
There we go

816
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,400
You do not I'm pretty sure the blast site does major damage so you do not want to be hanging around too close

817
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,320
No people it's a nuclear testing site

818
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:10,520
All right, okay, we'll head on next there seems to be some sort of tank a wee baby tank up ahead where we are. Oh

819
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
my god, wait, whoa

820
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,400
Sorry, I'm just trying to put something up there. There's something blue up there. Is this a secret?

821
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,480
All right, hold on. Let me get rid of wherever this red is

822
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Hello, oh

823
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,560
It's a wee baby Mac. Okay, it's fine

824
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
It's fine

825
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,520
That's what we don't it cause too much destruction of core

826
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,960
corporation

827
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,400
Is this a secret? Honestly, it's like a secret. There's something blue up here

828
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,800
Hold on. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Let's just oh, let's just scare him this bad boy. Oh

829
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
No, it's is it

830
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm sorry, but that looks like a hopscotch thing and there's something up there, but it's not registered

831
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,200
Well, we'll leave that I'm not but actually I will say it was really nice

832
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,960
They actually put a detail in the city like oh, we're a tourist site. Yeah, you should totally come see this tourist place

833
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
There's not one person around

834
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I was gonna surprise

835
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
They just told the university

836
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,880
They've in oh god, there's an enemy right here, right? Yeah, come in the war come in the war

837
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Oh, you want to be in the war so badly? Oh, you want to stay on the land whilst I stay in the war

838
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,200
Oh

839
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,800
No, no, no, that's cheating only I'm allowed in the water. Oh my god. He has a fucking all century. Fuck you

840
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,880
That's been awful. Oh shit. Oh

841
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,800
Shit, what is this always? Oh

842
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
No, it's definitely not always

843
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,400
It's taking him down though, whatever

844
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,640
Okay, let's just do that again. He's getting low. Let's just spam spam some some

845
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
There we go

846
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,480
Cuttlefish at home in the war literally he didn't stand a chance of some sort of enemy a tank in the war I

847
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,720
See this Johnny

848
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,640
Stranny lore comes in handy for this game type literally come into the water, you know, you want to

849
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I

850
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,200
Unfortunately have no recollection or recollection of any of this. Oh, it's another mech. I see on the HUD. You see that

851
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,120
bomb

852
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,840
Square

853
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
into the water

854
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Unless there's water ahead of me. Oh

855
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,160
Oh, he's coming to the left. Oh, he's trying to give me the jump right hold on if the AI is gonna come to me

856
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,240
I'm gonna jump in the war again. So he's coming. He's coming

857
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,360
There he is

858
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Yes

859
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,000
Now I would do siren singing but as you all know the best I can do is some mech singing

860
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,080
Plunk plunk cling flying. I'm a mech

861
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Plank flying flying

862
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Something

863
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,960
It's not a mech. Thankfully, I'm getting a bit

864
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
I know literally

865
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,760
Collateral must be expensive on these jobs. Literally. What's that video? Whoa, you came out nowhere. You're still in the building

866
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
Are we done

867
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Oh, I like this

868
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Feel

869
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Sorry, this one's really stuck in my head right now

870
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
It's just the part where it goes on

871
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,040
How many missions does this game have cling flying? I'm a mech

872
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
You want to come into the water?

873
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Right hydration check

874
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Okay, mission briefing. We're in range to target a mage. My headache is gone. Thanks to the painkillers

875
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,360
We take out the ground forces and a tank depot second. We storm the airfield make sure no planes fly out of there

876
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,480
Third the helicopter depot, but they'll be after you by then

877
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,720
Last thing remote recon shows a helicopter mission try me out. Yeah, good luck. Love. What's inside destroy it

878
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Think you've got enough to do mech warrior

879
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,800
Think you've got enough to do we've unlocked

880
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Ooziel

881
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,720
The ooziel is a medium mech built to bring impressive firepower

882
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Let's give them a shot if I've unlocked them the new let's see them a wee shot

883
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,000
There are a total of 20 playable missions in microsoft campaign in five

884
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Oh

885
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
The

886
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,600
This game cannot balance itself for its freaking life. All right, sorry, there's a wee human here somewhere

887
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Oh

888
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,200
Why okay and then in a mix I'll use the double

889
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Wow

890
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,560
See it's the is these things you really don't want to lose too much damage to the last thing you want

891
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
There's so much red on the map

892
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,480
I don't see yeah, okay, that's why I don't want to lose health

893
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm trying to play super safe

894
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
Because I don't want to

895
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,360
Although we could always try a different make if we if we messed up on a mission. I mean the game really isn't the

896
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,640
I don't think it's too punishing the missions don't actually seem that long until I'd assume that

897
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
As if I got hit by

898
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
There's something coming off of me

899
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Right we get it

900
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Let's get rid of these bombs

901
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Fucking doing some serious tech damage

902
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Oh, you're gonna think

903
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,960
Okay, this this is why the cougar is probably better or the fumon physics shoot two of these pair one words. I'm just doing one damage now

904
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,520
Mmm, if I picked the wrong bed, I may have but it's okay. I'll try my best

905
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
We get it you beat

906
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Oh

907
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,880
Does chat work on screen again for somebody to turn the among us collab chat with not working on screen

908
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,000
I should like literally turn it off and put myself on chat

Wow

940
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,840
Is this more or less of a mech warrior spin-off

941
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Isn't this the original mech?

942
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,640
That's all like any mech type game. I don't know. I'm unsure you you guys would know better than me

See you're worrying about

968
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,040
Uh

969
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,520
Look on the bright side capitalism could no longer exploit him. No

970
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
But now it's like

971
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,880
Whoa, oh, I thought it's gonna get away with that without it. Yeah

972
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,880
Oh, wait, no, you guys are like super weak. I don't need to do the big one on them

Okay, it's like two shots on a chopper is that whoa, there's one above me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't think you're getting away. You should be once you're done for

975
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
I hope it was worth it. Fuck you

976
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,120
Exactly god. I'm getting low health

977
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,040
Wait, why am I I'm drowning?

978
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,920
Uh, you can drown in this game question mark. This is news to me

979
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,160
Look how much damage I just took because I was sitting in the water. Are you joking me?

980
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,760
And there's a fucking mech on this way

981
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,200
Oh my god, too deep in the water starts flooding the fucking mech

982
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,200
Oh one enemy ahead of me

983
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,200
Is it gonna come over so I can shoot him? I just took so much damage. I don't have to use

984
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
Where's the enemy?

985
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Wait the chopper is the fucking enemy

986
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
I was a bit overkill

987
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,920
Oh my god, I need health but I don't have it

988
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
No, no that one

1009
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,960
No, everything see these helicopter pads. Oh my god, they're registering as like something that's in my way

1010
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh

1011
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,760

Strategically left mek hearing I am forever and hmm. Yeah

1014
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,620
The dialogue in this game is like a

1015
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,620
Oh

1016
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,540
Captain our objective has always been to disrupt the word of Blake and disable the orbital guns

1017
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:24,780
I cannot believe I almost lost the top about right weren't you just telling me that last night cowboy

1018
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,700
Sirs the job is this

1019
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:33,540
Are the commentators, you know make it out to see working each other for the orbital guns

1020
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,340
So this is critical. The problem is going to be the terrain

1021
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,940
Hold on a minute. I'm just gonna slow you down. So keep an eye out for shortcuts over dry land

1022
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,700
What madman would ask Johnny Keese that make

1023
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,180
Get to it mek warrior time to get wet. Yo, we don't need to know you're like

1024
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,940
Whoa

1025
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,100
Lial

1026
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:02,740
Billy L a variant of the Ozil is built to field up here or formidable

1027
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,700
Gossas rifle and I never use rifles, you know that I

1028
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,380
Don't I don't think I don't think he's the one I

1029
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,540
Don't think he's the one

1030
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:22,860
Now is he'll against a mech is like pretty OP. I'm quite I'm quite biased to zeal right now

1031
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,900
He is not the one pronounced like

1032
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,300
I

1033
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,140
Have no idea what mission

1034
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,300
So I looked up and they were like this game takes the average to play but I'm like

1035
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:55,700
I think it I don't think it takes eight hours. I'm not under the impression. It actually is the ever matter to show

1036
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,100
Don't have to tell me twice. Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Oh, you've got a whole breach

1037
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,460
Oh, no, you're taking water on board. Oh, no, I don't get your life jacket on

1038
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,060
Oh, it's too late. No, there's not enough time for the life jacket

1039
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:22,100
Eight game journalist hours, okay, maybe eight for a hundred percent. I don't I don't think there's any hundred percent

1040
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,100
There's no like collected or anything

1041
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,460
Oh

1042
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:40,260
That's creative putting a freaking turret on a bridge, I did not expect that you know what video game

1043
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,540
Yeah, that's what I thought honestly, but do that again

1044
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,580
Don't even make me regret being so nice

1045
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,580
I'm missing on purpose

1046
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:02,700
Oh, I've done it. That's I just pretty satisfying when it's one shot. It feels like this is a shotgun in terms of late

1047
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,660
Oh

1048
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,060
Wow, I'm just destroying the entire river

1049
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,660
Sometimes

1050
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:27,460
Whoa, sorry the controls are a bit funny. Please remember this game is back when

1051
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,740
Whoa, what was that?

1052
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:40,940
Oh, thank God back in the day when they were like made things invisible they weren't actually invisible so they were like being nice to you

1053
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,660
I

1054
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:51,980
Remember playing a similar mech assault game, but on the Xbox you're gonna shit yourself when you find out this next piece of information

1055
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,060
This is mech assault from the Xbox original

1056
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,460
Very good game

1057
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,140
My it's probably one of the first games I was a child

1058
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,940
Just when it comes to

1059
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,940
Stuff

1060
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,220
Can you play that? Yeah, I feel like a

1061
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,980
Who's gonna love you

1062
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,300
Destroy the drawbridge

1063
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,680
Now the townspeople can escape you're welcome

1064
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,540

Did I feel oh, sorry, I was person about sorry lads may just feel this mission cuz I've been having a Katie on

1067
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,740
Hurry up, I'm sorry. I was freaking role-playing. Okay. I was letting the townspeople escape

1068
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,180
You need to play with that beggar. I don't know how those

1069
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,220
Obviously like back in the day. Yeah, those controllers thought

1070
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,300
I

1071
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
Don't like that

1072
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,020
Big big coming I see big big on the map

1073
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,340
Nope, that was just a tiny human

1074
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,100
You are not giving me a chance

1075
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,740
Sorry, I did not

1076
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:53,100
He's stuck if he's stuck I'm leaving. I'm sorry if the if the game might

1077
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:04,060
You didn't even give me a fucking second you didn't even give me a fucking second even I

1078
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:10,220
Pissed the ball. I pissed about for like 50%. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. My wee Xbox is good

1079
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:14,460
It's got dust in the fans. Sorry. My Xbox has dust in the fans. If you saw that my apologies

1080
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,220
I messed around and that we towned for how long I

1081
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:29,420
Literally destroyed am I going crazy. I destroyed a drawbridge and then that was it I was done

1082
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,580
Bro these games are brutal

1083
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,100
I

1084
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,100
Ain't exactly making much

1085
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:51,940
Just focus on the river every second you stop to do anything the boat. Yeah, literally timed mission. Hey

1086
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,660
Honestly, is it all getting done for it? I don't know why video games

1087
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,300
At least I know was coming up ahead so I can kind of deal with it as a

1088
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,740
as

1089
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,500
I

1090
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,860
That's not what that meant in French. I meant as I arrive

1091
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,500
That means something else in French. It means fireworks in French

1092
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,820
So I do apologize the one French person listening in right now my bad. She's sorry

1093
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,780
Right don't stop

1094
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,780
Moving down the river

1095
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,860
Ten shots, please do not pair a friend

1096
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,420
Well, he's limping

1097
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,780
Wow

1098
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,660
He'll point

1099
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,780
We're just gonna have to keep her going

1100
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:18,540
Keep her going that make one some of this you can come get it

1101
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
Let's get some I

1102
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:26,700
Hate timed missions. They always suck. Thank you. I'm glad you guys freaking agree

1103
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,220
I don't know why they insist on them. I hate a cheeky time mission

1104
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:35,180
Like even in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, they have like those missions where you have to like

1105
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,660
Hold on, let me get my game

1106
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,820
I'm getting a bit more. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting a wee bit more than I'd like

1107
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:57,540
Wait, this is the end of the math if I go in the wrong way. No, I couldn't have the boy

1108
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:06,620
I'm trying to chase a ship. I'm trying my best. I really am

1109
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:14,900
I'm ready to spank something that comes in my peripheral have I gone the wrong way

1110
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,460
Because I'm about to start getting the ships we're getting away

1111
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,460
And then the cutscene is like every like five seconds like oh, thanks. Yeah, I really caught up to that ship. He got me

1112
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,220
Oh

1113
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,740
Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to pick up the tail. I really am

1114
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:54,180
Okay, let's get a fucking move one. I need to tell sorry I do

1115
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,740
Here we go here we go here we go

1116
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,220
Oh

1117
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,700
That's what I missed. Okay. Okay. Oh

1118
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:13,300
That makes much more sense. I was like, where the heck are they going?

1119
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,580
Disappearing on me like that. I love the air

1120
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,180
I remember when you need to kill three war generals in

1121
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,140
Five minutes in a feature

1122
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,020
Infidel brethren watch and learn

1123
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,500
You

1124
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,060
Here's our situation

1125
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:12,900
We're landing in what we hope is a secure location, but it looks like the enemy may have spotted us

1126
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,260
There's several enemy units in the area and

1127
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:20,540
Towards our position as soon as we learn you'll need to secure the landing zone

1128
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:25,380
More interesting. It looks like the word is transporting a new mad cat

1129
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,780
We need more firepower. So I want that heavy mech

1130
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:35,700
It's against my better judgment, but once you capture the mad cat lieutenant Foster will pilot it back to the Icarus

1131
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,980
Try and make sure that breathing boy doesn't kill himself

1132
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:47,980
Right, I'm I'm sorry, but Ooziel is kind of getting me good. I have to admit that double

1133
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,140
and

1134
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,140
That double

1135
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,100
Will be on the ground momentarily

1136
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,420
That double

1137
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,660
Destroying mech so quickly. I'm very biased

1138
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:09,060
Double PPC. Hmm. Defend it

1139
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,900
They know what help they ain't gonna know what help give me

1140
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,020
Hey

1141
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,260
Is this their soul is he gonna come through the trees?

1142
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,860
No, he's actually using hold on a minute. He's using

1143
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,060
Whoa, you take four heads. Well, maybe I should have gone quicker because he

1144
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,340
Wait, why this doesn't do any heat damage

1145
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm the only

1146
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,380
I'm the only one that's supposed to do this. I make myself clear

1147
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:09,020
Wait, okay, hold on hold on and then one more. No

1148
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,620
Shit, I'm over here

1149
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,660
No

1150
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,940
Okay

1151
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,260
I don't know how much health this thing has

1152
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,620
Oh

1153
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:41,980
They really require for god this game got me stressed. This is a I thought gaming was supposed to be freaking

1154
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,380
What role am I playing the victim?

1155
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:51,180
There's one over to the right. I can see on the HUD and he's fucking getting take damage and fuck you you little shit

1156
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,740
Oh my god, it's like literally on fire

1157
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,540
Oh my god, stop

1158
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,540
Stop, I think I'm actually gonna lose the section

1159
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,020
No more I can't take anymore. Oh, thank god

1160
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,340
Okay, oh my god

1161
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Reflings are either baddies. No, we're rebel. Wait, are we the baddies in this game? I was like, we're really goodies

1162
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,980
Right, I'm staying out the water until I know it's not too

1163
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:26,220
That makes go so much colder than the rocket's permanently negative. So that ppc

1164
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:29,820
Well, that's why I like camping in the water

1165
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,540
But as I learned from that other round, right, there's an enemy there, but I don't even think you can

1166
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:44,700
He does an awful lot of what's in you in the works

1167
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:50,060
Is this I have gone the wrong way, please forgive my ignorant

1168
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:56,860
We are the neutral third party that the locals picked to fight with

1169
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:04,860
If if if the lower class picks us then surely we're the goodies

1170
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,700
Sure

1171
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
That's how it works, right

1172
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,500
I love the tanks taking like a bit of side damage there. That was kind of funny like it almost flipped on its side a little bit

1173
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,420
The aim control goes different when you're like inside that week two days

1174
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,340
Hey, you ain't getting me

1175
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,500
Something here that is getting me though

1176
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,460
What is that just uh

1177
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:48,700
Just a wee tank off you pop off you pop see and you know my problem anymore off you pop

1178
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:55,660
Whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm trying to reach out. Give me a freaking say. I see a health though

1179
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,940
I'll take it. I'll take it. I see health. Oh sugar that went right on me

1180
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,500
Now's not the time in film trade now's not the time

1181
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,740
Ah

1182
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,140
Okay, I need to cool down

1183
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,700
I'm gonna

1184
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,620
At least you're gonna have health on this

1185
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:34,620
Fuck you. Oh my god. Oh get away. Get away. Did anyone take damage?

1186
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm over here

1187
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,700
Just trying to commit to war crimes against but you can't say that stuff at live

1188
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,580
I read that out loud my youtube channel gets shut down instantly

1189
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,260
Oh, whoa, I was not paying attention

1190
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,860
Yeah, fuck them trees up. Yeah, fuck them up

1191
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,460
I

1192
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,460
Am I overheating hold on

1193
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,100
Uh, give me just give me a saying they'll come kill you and saying just my mix. Uh, it's gonna be a bit warm

1194
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,180
We bet we bet to stay inside this mix

1195
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,260
No

1196
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:39,740
Stop them and foster and our techs will take care of it. Okay a tamed convoy a tamed convoy

1197
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:44,060
Don't get too distracted. There's a tamed convoy

1198
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,260
I can handle the convoy

1199
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,940
Okay

1200
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,060
I'm trying

1201
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,460
I'm

1202
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,500
I

1203
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,020
All right, fuck this

1204
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,820
Am I gonna lose it? I think I am

1205
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,180
Because the convoy keeps moving stop moving

1206
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,020
Stop moving I'm fucking the convoy. I'm fucking the med cat

1207
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,140
I know I'm

1208
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:57,180
Me and the boys in the in the mad cat oh something's gonna happen

1209
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,340
Oh, is that supposed to be him picking up the mech

1210
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,220
On your position

1211
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,140
Okay, okay, I can do that

1212
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:17,660
I'm so brave. I'm brave. Can you get the fuck out of my way? Oh crap. Where are they coming from?

1213
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,860
Oh

1214
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,860
Like the simulator I need some time

1215
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:34,780
I'm sorry, mate. No, I can't even aim right. You're so small. I can't even hit you

1216
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,100
Oh, shoot

1217
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:41,980
The mechs are coming from this way the mechs are coming from this way serpentine serpentine

1218
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,140
I don't know why I thought they would come the other way. This seems they were coming from behind

1219
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,100
Wow

1220
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,100
Reinforcement

1221
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,980
Okay

I thought it was gonna be what wait, he's not even gonna help me fight bro turn around you have fucking artillery anything

1223
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,780
Oh

01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,540
Ah, hold on I need to learn

1225
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:31,740
Come on and I walked right into that hold on this could be a health pack

1226
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:38,540
Yeah, you're getting done. Yeah, you're getting done. No, okay after I told that building you're done for

1227
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,100
Did I make myself clear?

1228
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,140
Oh, come on

01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,740
Bro, you must perish. Yeah. Yeah, you don't fire

I hope he's okay

1232

I'm clear of the city. I'm hearing me Icarus. Good work, lieutenant foster

1233
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:15,660
Captain for good measure destroy the base at the north end of the city and don't leave any of those buildings standing

1234
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,340
Uh, total annihilation. Yes, ma'am

1235
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:23,260
You don't have to tell me why I said no power for you

1236
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,780
No power. No one's allowed electricity

1237
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,780
I'm saving you allergy because how can they charge electricity if it'll provide you the service seat? You're welcome

1238
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,140
I don't want to waste the purple

1239
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,100
Fuck you

1240
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,140
Oh, this is satisfying. Oh, I wouldn't take it that one over there

1241
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:56,140
Hold on hold on give me a second. Let him get up

1242
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:06,380
Wow, okay, I have to admit sniping from afar. I'm I'm here for it. Oh, wow

1243
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,540
I just need that broken to go up

1244
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,380
Stop spawning in your unit

1245
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:18,140
Stop it. Please do not go on that helicopter

1246
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,700
Okay

1247
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,900
Okay, we've done the helicopter one now we're going to do the car one

1248
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,220
Okay, and then there's something over there. I can see me

1249
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:34,220
Okay

1250
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,340
I have to admit leveling an entire area very satisfying

1251
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:49,820
Oh, no, they're gonna be mixed behind something because look there's a health pack there and there

1252
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:55,980
Wait, something's shooting at me. A car? How dare you?

1253
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,220
Wait, I can't auto look. I was gonna say I'm pretty sure I can auto look

1254
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,780
I'm trying

1255
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:11,180
I just take a little whale. Okay. I can I think the boss battle. I'm gonna be honest. I said I'm sorry

1256
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:15,660
It's starting to get a feeling there's gonna be a boss battle. Well, that level up meat. I go back

1257
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,820
Uh, can I destroy this by walking into it?

1258
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,340
I'm getting nervous

1259
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,340
Good work

1260
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,500
But I call dibs oh man, I love this

1261
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:43,900
Now this is the dom content from a complete flattening babies for him time for you days

1262
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:49,900
Whoa, I've got signatures heading towards us. Well, we didn't even you have a cutscene or nothing

1263
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,620
right

1264
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:56,620
Mind yourself lieutenant piloting a mech is not a game

1265
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:03,740
Wait, am I supposed to be lieutenant right now? Whoa, my cat has four auto logs. I'm here for it

1266
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:13,900
Um overheating though, this is a heavy mecha. Oh look, there's me wait

1267
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:25,020
The dialogue is like so cute

1268
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,980
Oh

1269
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,340
Bro, you're kind of cramping my sail with your aim

1270
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:43,260
Wow, it takes a while to load that for a math admit that's like it's not instant. It's like a

1271
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,780
Reload

1272
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:53,020
Oh my god, but this is so I'm doing like so much damage that things aren't like alive long enough to even hurt me

1273
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:59,580
I'm looking at what the AI is trying to do something's sponding because look I'm going for it. He's even

1274
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,580
Where is it? Where's it? Oh this guy can't fly

1275
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,380
Is that take reduced damage

1276
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,740
I think that may be reduced damage

1277
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,580
Lieutenant has been given your make now you're having the magical

1278
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:18,860
Ah

1279
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:23,020
Heavy makes can't fly too big. Okay. I like that detail. I assume my little

1280
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,540
Is there something out here about me?

1281
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,900
I think something's stuck. Oh, here we go

1282
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,980
Can't see the fight for the trees

1283
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,540
Oh

1284
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:50,220
That's got hurt. Yeah, we what six maybe six

1285
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,860
Oh, I missed because of the tree have you

1286
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,540
Oh, no, I'm still eight

1287
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,580
I mean, that was too less

1288
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,460
So still definitely heavy cat. I'm a fan of a heavy make

1289
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,380
It won't be more another one. There's choppers inbound

1290
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
more like choppers out of

1291
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,460
Order instead of inbound

1292
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,580
Go that one

1293
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,260
I can see that there's a mech approaching

1294
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:34,300
Oh, did I get you? I did not get you. What did get you? Hold on. Let me deal with the mech or something

1295
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,460
All right, you next and then you

1296
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,580
All right, let's take the aggro off of the fucking

1297
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:57,500
I that missed again. Okay. Wow purple is like putting them on glass

1298
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,900
Wow

1299
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:03,420
For hit for oh my god, that was so good

1300
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:14,940
Oh, yeah, good job briefing boy. Okay. I'm a bit of a simp for the mad cat right now. That was a this is a good make

1301
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:19,820
Okay, we've got the word of Blake's attention. So now we hurt them

1302
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:26,460
One of their key tactical command centers is a nick of everything. We're ever gonna have a chance to get those global guns

1303
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:31,180
We've got to take it out. We can't hit them head-on. So we're gonna turn out the lights

1304
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,140
I like is so large. It has to try to attack

1305
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:41,820
We're gonna blow that plant and I take ten beech ever make a soul and I don't think anything came up of the original

1306
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,260
And I'm like, oh, am I making reach of her history the only mech?

1307
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,260
We've got powerful enough to handle this is the magic

1308
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:52,700
Don't make me making each of your history the first person to make a soul. Oh, you don't have to ask me twice. Oh

1309
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:57,260
Um, you're a unique gamer. Yeah

1310
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:06,220
Okay, first official mission is the mad cat bright lights dark sea

1311
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,100
It's a lot for battle tech rare for beachable is that touch battle tech game?

1312
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:15,020
Um, doesn't Titanfall 2 count as a battle tech?

1313
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,020
Right, hold on

1314
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,020
I'll write that down somewhere

1315
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,780
Thanks

1316
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:31,900
Yeah, literally bro, as I said these games do not follow the etiquette when it's in the tree to fall in

1317
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,900
You're supposed to like be given like five seconds. Whoa

1318
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:44,060
You're supposed to be given some abbreviation to the enemies like shooting at yeah, this game does not give life to the rats

1319
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:51,180
Oh, wow, it splits up the aim as well. So, okay, that's really good if it splits up the aim

1320
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,340
It's technically like less to do

1321
01:23:54,540 --> 01:24:00,780
Right mad cats can't fly must remember mad cats cannot fly because I'm gonna get confused when I'm in the middle of my fight

1322
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,860
And I'm like get up get up get up

1323
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,860
And nothing's happening

1324
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,980
Okay, there we go

1325
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,140
There seems to be two enemies over here

1326
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:15,900
One

1327
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,700
Yeah, I can kind of see why they had to put AI. Oh, I just picked up sorry

1328
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,500
Sorry, you were just on transport

1329
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,020
Bridges whoa

1330
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,860
Uh the bridge

1331
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:40,300
What's going on am I going mental I'm getting absolutely kablami

1332
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,260
Is there stuff constantly respawned

1333
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:50,060
There's one of them respawned buildings back there. I don't I can't identify the title

1334
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,460
Sir twin pumas outbound from the base

1335
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:02,380
Uh get me in the water in the water. I love being in the water

1336
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,500
Water to be in the water right now

1337
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,940
Oh, I'm not really cooling down that much

1338
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,460
Mmm

1339
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:18,780
Get away from me. He's gonna explode. Oh shit. I'm at events of the game. I'm not supposed to go any further back

1340
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,900
Bruh pull up

1341
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,220
Is it gonna drop right behind me now

1342
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,300
Sorry bro

1343
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:35,580
Okay, we're okay. We're okay as long as we don't

1344
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,140
First

1345
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,660
Oh, we're fucking him. Oh one more. Yeah, he's limping

1346
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,900
I always wanted a city of bio

1347
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,780
Right, we need to blow up the bridge

1348
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,780
Is it faster?

1349
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:09,180
To my fans already made that joke go away already made that joke. I think the water strat is best for the rocket

1350
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,260
Oh

1351
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:13,260
And not this one

1352
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:18,700
Bridges dusted well done. That'll keep the base from sending out help. Can I hit from here?

1353
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,020
Oh, I can't

1354
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,100
You

1355
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,140
You and we're done

1356
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:40,940
Whoa god my poor xbox. It's so old. That's really struggling

1357
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,780
I'm glad that it can capture the game

1358
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:51,100
Yes, I'm glad my xbox original survived

1359
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,940
Do you guys remember when xbox crystal was a thing?

1360
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:59,020
Hmm just remember that are you too much of a baby?

1361

Wait, you're playing on xbox. Yeah, I'm on the xbox original. It's working so well right now

1364
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,780
I don't know how an air

1365
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:24,380
It's doing so well after being in storage for over 20 years

1366
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,820
Oh my god, that's

1367
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:33,100
The tunnel this tunnel right here

1373
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,540
The sore kind the kind that no one wants

1374
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,660
Okay, we've got it

1375
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,940
No

1376
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:34,540
The bridge the bridge is in the way of my target

1377
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:39,980
Oh, we've got it. We've got it and one more which is dead ahead

1378
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,420
Did you ever dust the maybe was messing up with transition? Yeah

1379
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:52,540
Yeah, great great good advice. Thank you

1380
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:58,220
Guys, this isn't emulator. That's why it's fucking up

1381
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:03,740
Wait, I'm gonna go here. Okay time for the newt plant itself

1382
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:09,660
Foster set up the tactical data. Yes, sir. The OGA flow control is like a hundred bucks raw. Oh

1383
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:19,020
Ah wait no part two what it's loading a new area. It's still the same map. Okay, sir

1384
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:23,100
The newt plant is inside a contained area to get through the gate

1385
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,100
You need to destroy the power generator

1386
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:35,420
Take out defenders around generator. Okay defender

1387
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,700
Take out defenders there's something in front of you

1388
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:46,060
I freaking saw yous on the HUD. He's such me liars honestly

1389
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:51,100

Oh, no, I'm overheating

1391
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,220
Wow two for one, baby

1430
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:17,260
not be anywhere I am without you guys carrying me that lion I cannot I spoke

1431
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:23,740
just send a little bit after and I watch her play it and I'm like brah you guys

1432
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:29,300
have like such good patience it's insane like I did not have the patience to be

1433
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:36,340
like I don't know like I mean I know it's like oh get good scrolls like I

1434
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:40,460
don't you guys have fantastic patience like it's such a good trait to be able to

1435
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:44,660
do that like you're honestly I don't ironically like that patience that you

1436
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:48,420
can show by like playing it and like trying to beat it and that perseverance

1437
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:51,620
is like fantastic

1438
01:33:51,620 --> 01:34:06,540
that's why I didn't want to overheat then you would have freaking company right

1439
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,700
oh there's a healing stick oh there's also stuff inside that warehouse I can

1440
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:21,500
see it I have to actually use the road like a normal net for from

1441
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:25,060
soft really does not care if you beat it or not I thought yeah that is not our

1442
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:35,900
problem it says it's pointing this way like to go back it's a lot easier to be

1443
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:39,020
patient for something you know in advance will take a long time and not be

1444
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:42,260
stuck on something that you think should be easy I guess yeah like if you know

1445
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:46,940
what you're getting into she just spent like six hours beating vanilla whoa a

1446

You

1635
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,760
I may or may not have put cat food in my tea

1636
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:04,160
Oh

1637
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:16,280
Here's the score the Icarus sitting duck we need to set up another base so we can finish the job and take out those orbital

1638
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:28,240
Towers the enemy and I just made my tea there, and I'm like I can read from our own sense

1639
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,560
So I'm about to figure out

1640
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:43,840
Thor on the rocks are we already on Ragnarok are we getting close?

1641
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:48,800
Sorry, did someone say oh, thank you. Don't stay down for the

1642
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,760
Super chat

1643
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,320
Bro, I just the Oreo just all in my bed extra protein. I mean

1644
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:00,080
Uh, cat food isn't fit for human consumption, which I don't like

1645
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,800
I'd rather

1646
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:05,680
Oh

1647
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,520
How many missions Thor on the rocks are being in close? I'm getting nervous

1648
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:16,160
Timberwolf, who are you a variant of the successful mat the timber wolf has suited for any

1649
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,200
battlefield role

1650
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:21,600
I don't

1651
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:27,040
I don't use the pew-pews, but I use the shoulder thing below. Is this eight shoulder things?

1652
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,760
They're faster though

1653
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,040
Timberwolf right fuck it. We'll give Timberwolf a go. Yeah Timberwolf. Let's go

1654
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,440
Make sure wonder what they put in the cat food. Yeah

1655
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,440
I'll fucking out just fondant

1656
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:51,200
Forgot how it play like in five seconds. Um, oh it comes to snow

1657
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,840
Uh

1658
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:00,720
Yeah, do you if you want to hear how dumb I was as a child are they gonna come from the top? Oh, yeah, they are

1659
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,840
Oh, no, they only have super um

1660
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,280
They are

1661
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,800
um

1662
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,080
So this is probably the most disgusting story you're gonna hear all day

1663
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:19,440
Um, I used to eat cat food when I was like four years old because I was convinced it would turn me into a cat

1664
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:22,000
um

1665
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:28,800
So I could have a very vivid memory of uh under the kitchen sinkers where the cat food who was uh like in her house

1666
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:36,160
And I used to take a spoon fill out of the tin and eat it because I thought it was gonna turn me into a cat

1667
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:38,960
And yeah, it's not my brightest moment

1668
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:42,160
Uh

1669
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:50,320
I don't know why in my head it was gonna turn me into a cat. It just was like, yeah, that makes perfect sense if I eat this cat food

1670
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,160
So I I know what cat food tastes like

1671
02:07:54,800 --> 02:08:01,680
Uh, I could tell by the smell if a cat's gonna enjoy it or not because of this dumb thing I did as a freaking child

1672
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:07,920
Um, but it's like I can laugh at it now, but oh my god

1673
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,600
Yeah

1674
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,320
My my shock and horror that I just wake up with cat ears

1675
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:19,120
I

1676
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:24,640
And it and that behavior went on for quite a while. I'm not even gonna lie. I think it was probably a solid month

1677
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:28,000
I would just wonder the cupboard a bit. Oh, I need a little snack

1678
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,600
And if my mom didn't give me a snack, I just wonder

1679
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,680
And the thing is all cat food labels like have a thing on it

1680
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:41,520
That's like not fit for human consumption because of like the guts that they usually like

1681
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,800
Oh

1682
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:47,280
And the worst thing is it's not like it was refrigerated like it was open

1683
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,400
Oh, hold on. Sorry

1684
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:56,560
Sorry video game. I'm telling this really disgusting story. The worst part was it wasn't refrigerated. It's like open canned

1685
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:58,160
a

1686
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:00,160
Like cat food

1687
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,800
How old were you at the time four? I was like four not 13. Stay on

1688
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:09,520
What if I told you you're not the first person to tell a story like this? Oh, thank god

1689
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:10,960
I

1690
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,520
Feel a bit better now then if that's the case

1691
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,360
Was it wet? Yeah, it was like the wet jelly in the can

1692
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,400
I still remember the noise the spoon made as I took it out of the can like that

1693
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:28,880
Um, it's absolutely mean. I know I'm so sorry. I don't have any excuse

1694
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
But that's hilarious that someone else told me

1695
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:38,160
I don't know. It just makes perfect sense. Like of course cat food people as if that just kamikaze into that

1696
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,200
I can't see this chopper. He's out of range. But he is there are there is

1697
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,480
You're next buddy

1698
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,600
Find and destroy the wobb sense or net

1699
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,560
Wait, so I need to go back again

1700
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:59,040
I get eaten kivel, but jeez. Yeah, like that's why

1701
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:02,960
So I'm a bit passionate. I'm like, no, I don't want uh

1702
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:08,800
I'd rather cat food said it's fit for human consumption. Not because I want to eat it

1703
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:12,000
And turn into a cat. But because

1704
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:19,360
I don't think that you should be giving your pet something that you the human aren't fit to consume

1705
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:22,080
um

1706
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:29,680
Lack of nutrients for humans, but it's generally safe in an emergency the furry arc. No, I'll pass

1707
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,240
AC's like

1708
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:34,240
in development

1709
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:37,440
AC was like as far as we'll go

1710
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:40,160
Right

1711
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,400
Um, because we did entertain the possibility

1712
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:49,440
But we decided it would be far too much of a

1713
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:54,800
I can see so much red, but it's not like giving me one thing to shoot at

1714
02:10:55,520 --> 02:11:02,320
Um, but we decided it was far too much of a like negative thing. Holy crap. Something is like obliterating me

1715
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:09,600
You you're obliterating

1716
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:17,840
Right, I'm going the wrong way. Hold on. I guess we have to come back that way. Gee, there's like so many countries though

1717
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,880
I think there's one in the rocks, maybe

1718
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:30,640
Anyway long story short, I'm a special child. Is there one hiding? I'm so confused. It says there's something there

1719
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,280
There's an enemy back out there

1720
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:52,800
You can spam with a wildcat though. What is get you? Yep. I knew you were right there. I can see you on the hot

1721
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,400
Well, what are you?

1722
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:00,640
Okay, so this is the mad cat egg

1723
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,760
Whoa, something's getting me from behind as well. Holy shit. You pop off

1724
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:23,760
I hate when the game does that when these bombs aren't behind you because look how long it takes to freaking do a 180

1725
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:28,320
I'm half out as well. I don't like that at all

1726
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:41,440
Oh my god, please perish. What's going on?

1727
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Wow, don't do that again

1728
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:51,840
Holy moly, you almost got me. Something up here? Com tower?

1729
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,800
What's this then?

1730
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,440
Whoa

1731
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:07,120
Oh, it's cool. She's our special boomer on the floor

1732
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:13,920
When it was a child, I played with stuffed animals until they just have an even two in the school and they need honey

1733
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:17,760
And donate them all to cousin. That's what I'm holding. Oh, that's fucking sad as fuck though

1734
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:22,720
I remember my time. I got she got stolen at school

1735
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:28,080
I was raging because I knew exactly who did it and then the next year the freaking

1736
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:32,720
B-Och came back to school with it a year later

1737
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:38,000
And she's like, oh, I ran out of battery and I'm like, yeah, could you stole it off me and it's been a year you fucking

1738
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:40,640
bought

1739
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:42,720
Um

1740
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:50,480
How is the cat tea by the way? Okay before I forget but before the game starts like flashing us

1741
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,200
Hold on. I'm just gonna run in circles so the game doesn't like flash

1742
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,240
I don't know why stuffing makes it like panic

1743
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:05,840
Did I beat her up? I was like six years old. I did not beat her up. Um

1744
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,880
I basically I

1745
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:15,440
Knew she stole it. I told the teacher but the teacher like obviously didn't have the right to pat down a child or check through their bag

1746
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,120
um

1747
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:22,560
And basically the teacher was like, yes, Ronnie. Sorry, but you shouldn't have like you shouldn't bring

1748
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:29,520
Stuff into school that you can lose type idea. Hold on. I'm drinking my tea. I can't I don't I don't sense any cat

1749
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,920
Uh cat like um dusting

1750
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:34,720
In it

1751
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:41,520
If I read slime girl one more day, I see slime girl more than purple burglar alarm at this point

1752
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:49,200
Name air name air asking for slime girl. That's everyone's getting bent over anyone that types slime girl's getting bent over

1753
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:51,200
And I'm absolutely taking a bollican

1754
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:53,600
Because I've had enough

1755
02:14:53,600 --> 02:15:00,800
I'm putting my foot down the scottish vtuber gets asked for a fucking slime girl more than bloody purple burglar alarm

1756
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:04,000
Which everyone's obsessed by asking scottish people about

1757
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:07,120
Don't tempt them honestly

1758
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:14,400
A slime boy remember that time I was entertaining a male branch and then it like completely dissolved overnight

1759
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,800
I have no interest now

1760
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,960
Oh

1761
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,960
Yeah, but what about you know, slime

1762
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:28,960
Can you see squirrel eye? It's the french that can you see squirrel they go squee well

1763
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,760
Who a little squee well

1764
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,480
Just kidding a squee well

1765
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:38,960
Someone needs to make a compilation of every time someone asks about slime girl, bro

1766
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,480
They'd be at it for months

1767
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:45,040
You'd get more content out of people asking me for a slime girl than I do burps in general

1768
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:51,280
Yeah, french people go squee well wait, how did you say it's girl?

1769
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:56,080
Why a squirrel oh like there goes a squirrel

1770
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:02,400
Sounds like a short side deal actually I need to make a short. What was it?

1771
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:07,040
Oh fine. I guess you add my wee pog champ. Yeah, it was like something like that

1772
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:11,360
I need to make that I also need to make a song cover. So honestly if this game if we

1773
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:17,680
Do the opposite of game journalists this game that actually might come in fantastic and I can get even more work done

1774
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:23,760
I I my goal is to get a 2k. Thank you audio out

1775
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:26,000
Am

1776
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:31,520
Though I'm going to do the ear cleaning one because it has a funny little joke at the start. I think that one's the best

1777
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:36,080
I'm sorry. I keeping this dream buried for now slowly stewing in fermentin

1778
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:40,000
Look if one of the girls say they want a halloween slime variation

1779
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:47,200
Fine, okay. It's a whole new model. It's a whole new artwork. It's a whole new design fine. They can have it

1780
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,720
But no one is asked for one

1781
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:56,800
Game journalists or game regroup just a short shawnee shaming us for ideas. No, I don't I'm not shaming

1782
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,880
but like there's some stuff that's like

1783
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:02,800
If you don't know you don't know and like one of the unwritten rules are

1784
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:08,560
You know like don't have a cyclops. It's offputting people don't like it as a design debuff

1785
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:09,920
and

1786
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:16,400
You know someone being green again design debuff unless you made them only a tinge of green and said they were a halfling

1787
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:22,560
But she's like a muscle mummy in comparison to the average human sure fine. Let it happen multiple eyes

1788
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:27,840
Insect these are kind of unwritten things that are against the the norms and I'm happy to talk about it

1789
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,160
But I get nervous when I talk about it people take it like oh, she said insect girls

1790
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:39,520
Bad that means she hates and it's like no motherfucker. That's not how design works. You have to appeal to the masses

1791
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:44,720
The masses and you need to give a model to someone that isn't a debuff

1792
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:49,920
That isn't something that makes it even harder for them to succeed as a feature creator

1793
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,640
hey

1794
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:58,240
Oh, the shadows are back in full force. I'm slamming the desk. That's when you know, I was hardly slamming it

1795
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:59,920
I gave it a little bump

1796
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,880
Yeah, yeah slam sly cops. You're done

1797
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:05,680
Someone's gonna be like a slam

1798
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:10,720
praying man to cyclops that's green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1799
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:20,000
Give it a little bug pincers as well. Yeah, mommy doesn't hate a single thing. Have you checked her work? She seems to try everything

1800
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:27,120
We're looking to hit every demographic not a niche. Yeah, I mean do we need a halfling when we have a cuttlefish that needs a steps

1801
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:36,560
I'm not that small. I'm sorry, but five two is not that small. I'm literally bang on average height for the women in the world. Am I not?

1802
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:41,760
Am I not as to if five point two not bang average on height

1803
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:44,960
Just a slain blob. That's it

1804
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:50,160
Every day you push me to form an insect slain cyclops feature agency

1805
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:55,120
You just call it like I don't know what you should call it

1806
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:57,360
just be like

1807
02:18:57,360 --> 02:19:01,200
V success and then the the point is to prove that you can have a

1808
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:09,120
Successful beat of her as like this design. I think the average five four. Oh fuck me man V slimy. Okay, dude

1809
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:11,520
Freaks Incorporated

1810
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,240
V repel and they do the opposite repel

1811
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:20,240
I've almost finished my thing V cute short

1812
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:29,280
I'm starting to imagine that brain meme when you go to sleep saying that you have made a slime girl then

1813
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:35,520
Oh, imagine if that was the biggest turnaround of the century that there's already a slime girl design approved

1814
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:39,680
Hey, and I'm just pretending there isn't and I'm like, oh, I hate slime girls

1815
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,160
See it

1816
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,280
Can you tell me twice

1817
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:55,440
Wouldn't that not be the the ultimate debate

1818
02:19:56,400 --> 02:20:00,400
I mean if I pulled that off I'm gonna make if I pulled that off I deserve like all the whole

1819
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:14,560
Right, there's a lot of supplies in these barracks, which makes me think

1820
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,160
I

1821
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:39,120
Little bit hold on I need to lure the thing that would be such a dirty move five two is the global average in China

1822
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,800
Oh my god, I can't believe you guys find out. I'm secretly Asian right now

1823
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:47,600
Uh, I wasn't kidding when I said I had a Chinese and a

1824
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:50,560
I

1825
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:12,560
I really like her voice. I wish she voiced more video games. Maybe she has and I just don't know about it. Her voice is very

1826
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:19,840
Well, I could not even see that in bed

1827
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:28,720
No, just a few resupplies, okay, okay

1828
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:34,320
I love it when she calls you sport

1829
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:38,800
Oh, you're such a good sport little reflin even though I know you said that for the commentator

1830
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,800
But I don't I've never like I've ever called the reflin

1831
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:42,480
sport

1832
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:46,720
Oh, you're such a good sport watch me play these games that absolutely no one cares about

1833
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,040
Literally apparently I've made vtuber news by playing mech assault

1834
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:55,920
I'll need a check if there really hasn't been a vtuber that's played mech assault. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa bring it back

1835
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:57,920
Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring it back now. Yeah

1836
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,200
Everybody

1837
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,080
Oh, there's an

1838
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:09,520
Okay, I forget that I can hold down a on this guy

1839
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,840
Oh, I don't have an ultimate on this character

1840
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,800
Wow, I don't there's no ultimate

1841
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,840
There's no like defense or anything

1842
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:24,960
Uh, I think I'd rather just found this

1843
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,400
Oh, I'm taking a bit of damage

1844
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:32,000
Oh my god, please stop. Oh my god, please stop

1845
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:36,880
Stop. Oh my god, did you see those drinks?

1846
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:42,400
Call me the call me a hazard because of the way I did those drinks. Oh

1847
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:44,960
Oh

1848
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:48,480
Okay, hold on. I've got purple on this but it's pretty leveled up to me

1849
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,160
And it doesn't turn towards my

1850
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:58,880
Are you just taking that? Yeah, are you going to take that? Oh, fuck. He's actually getting me crazy right now

1851
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,120
Okay, and he puts that. Okay. Yeah. Good fuck me

1852
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,800
Give me that hill

1853
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:12,080
Get it. Get it. Jokes of hazard that that one movie that one tv show. No, it's a movie

1854
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:19,840
I can't and then he wanted to like impregnate uh someone underage or something. I can't recall the details. I apologize

1855
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:27,840
Yeah, you never heard of this. It was probably because my old school game knowledge is limited to nintendo

1856
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,840
Watch it collapsing tunnel

1857
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:42,560
Whoa, I didn't even know the game did things like that

1858
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,480
That's cheeky. That's cheeky. No, you know how to do that only I'm allowed to do that

1859
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:57,760
Damn that was loud was it? I'm so sorry the the game volume balance control. I actually might pin a comment

1860
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:00,400
uh

1861
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:04,880
There's something bad ahead of me. Oh, it's there

1862
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:13,600
Where is it? What?

1863
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:14,960
Hello

1864
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:19,280
Whoa, the game did not like that angle I entered and it we've been around

1865
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,480
She hasn't seen that before

1866
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:26,480
Literally, that's the fact. Whoa, there's two mechs on the battlefield

1867
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:32,400
Uh, I do not have infinite health. I'm gonna be honest. I do not have infinite health

1868
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:36,320
Okay, come come back come back come back

1869
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:40,160
Oh, and the trees are gonna blow come on down

1870
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:44,800
Right come back over here

1871
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,400
Fuck

1872
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:51,520
Can you aim a little bit please?

1873
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,920
And so for distancing, please please back up

1874
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:00,080
If I back up is it fast enough?

1875
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:07,200
Are you ready? Oh good. Oh good. Oh no. I'm out of special ammo. I'm down to red. I'm down to red. Hold on

1876
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:09,200
I'm getting a blittery right now. I'm on the line

1877
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,640
Hmm not enjoying this not enjoying this not enjoying this. I'm down. I'm down

1878
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,960
I'm down. Oh god, please

1879
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:24,560
Oh, I got special reds. I got special reds. Hold on

1880
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,600
Fuck them up. Fuck them up. Fuck them up. Make them regret it. Make them regret it

1881
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:35,520
Make them regret it. Oh god, he's getting some licks on me though. I don't like it. Oh, he's getting some decent licks on me

1882
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:38,560
Please stop

1883
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,080
Please stop

1884
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:42,080
Please please

1885
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:46,400
Oh my god, please just freaking die. Thank you

1886
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:54,960
Oh, I'm low health and I don't like it because I don't know where to get more health and I don't want to replay this whole section

1887
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:02,320
Don't give up. You got this. Thank you. I think there must have been health in the distance because that was rough

1888
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:04,320
Okay, I see health. I see health

1889
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:09,840
Well, I see green give me that health give me that ammo

1890
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:14,960
Give me whatever's in this building. What else do you owe for me?

1891
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:17,840
Oh

1892
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:27,280
Okay, okay, we can do this we can do

1893
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:34,160
Oh, can I don't need to snipe it from here? No, that can't be right

1894
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:40,160
Uh

1895
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,920
Is this got a HP bar or am I

1896
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:49,920
I don't really want to

1897
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:56,080
No, wait, hold on. Oh wait, it's breaking

1898
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,080
Okay, okay

1899
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:02,080
Is there any enemies got a lot of enemies?

1900
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Whoa, that's such a unique noise

1901
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:08,800
Only one more find it and we may be safe

1902
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,600
Okay, one more. Is there any

1903
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:13,200
special

1904
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:18,480
Healing around the corner. No, okay. I guess we're not at that stage in video game development when we put like little secrets

1905
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,680
No HP bar

1906
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,880
That plank master

1907
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,360
Okay

1908
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:31,360
Only like there's anything

1909
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,400
I'm getting nervous. I really don't want to

1910
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:36,720
Well

1911
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,040
I love how you look at

1912
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:44,080
You're mostly male that ain't going nah guys hate giant robots. No, I'm not like that. Just like

1913
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:50,160
I don't know. I feel like some v-tubers normally try and pick the most popular flavor of game

1914
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,320
Or am I being daft when I say that unknown case?

1915
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:01,040
An annoying helicopter squadron is this

1916
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:04,240
Oh

1917
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:06,640
Because

1918
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:23,200
I can hear him, but I don't see

1919
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:27,520
Oh

1920
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:32,880
Oh, is that why I lost my health in that earlier match because of the

1921
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:36,960
Oh

1922
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,840
Curious

1923
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:43,760
I hear a chopper. I don't see. Oh, I see it. I see it. I see it. Yeah, sorry

1924
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,880
Haha, wouldn't it be so funny if you had help or like anything?

1925
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,120
Having a good jolly time jolly good show

1926
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:04,400
I don't care about popular games robots shooting each other. It's like popular to me

1927
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:09,520
It's interesting if you actually like the game. Oh, you're gonna be melting for viva pinata then

1928
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:15,920
Filled with fun filled with fun viva pinata

1929
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:24,000
Wait, I'm not being dumb in the end then you go back then you go around then you do a u-turn

1930
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:26,240
I think I do

1931
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:28,240
You turn time

1932
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:32,480
No, don't look on to me. Don't don't tell them. I'm here

1933
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Don't be silly

1934
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,720
Don't tell them. I'm here. I saw that

1935
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:42,320
I saw that

1936
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:45,600
You got big mix. I'm just a wee make

1937
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:48,800
That has very little help

1938
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:50,800
We really appreciate it

1939
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:55,600
Oh, I'm like really trying not to take any damage from anything at the moment

1940
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:04,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not ready. Yeah. I'm not ready. Yeah. Hold on. I'm not ready for a mix

1941
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:06,880
Hey, where are you coming up here?

1942
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,080
Where are you here?

1943
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:13,360
Oh god, I can't see him

1944
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:16,800
Is he above I want to get licks in before he gets licks in on me

1945
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:20,960
I don't

1946
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:22,960

1947
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,640

1950
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:42,880
Let's make it fair. Come on. We're all lads here. We're all lads here. Get fucked. Get sniped. Oh, fuck that tree really took that

1951
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:46,240
Yeah, yeah, take that tree. That's what we think of you nature. Ah

02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:53,360
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up. One be one. One be one

1953

No, I'm not going around that corner. You are coming to me

1954
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:01,200
You are coming

1955
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,480

1956
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:03,440

1957
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:04,880
no

1958
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:11,440
I am not losing right at the end of this mission. I refuse. I'm sorry. I refuse. I actually refuse. Sorry. I refuse. I'm not losing

1959
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:14,080
You are losing right now

1960
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:22,960
I'm getting overheated. Sorry. I'm I'm not losing. I refuse. I refuse. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Take it. Take it like a good meg

1961
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,520
Take it

1962
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:30,480
Okay, up next his best pal, but I have health right. Who is this?

1963
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:33,840
Who is it?

1964
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:36,320
Okay, we're fine

1965
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,480
Oh

1966
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:46,480
Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. Oh my god. Please give me this like red fucking thing more for the rocket

1967
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,720
Like the power up because that's insane

1968
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:54,880
He's already low. Hold on. Hold on. Let me cool down mate. Mate. Hold pause. Pause. Let me time a shoe laces. Pause the fight

1969
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:58,880
Come on. Save first mate. Save first

1970
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:03,120
Come on. Come on

1971
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:10,640
Yeah, we did it. Or I'd make a goblin hack and build a creature

1972
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,720
Oh, no, please.

1973
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,680
New mate

1974
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:29,920
Oh

1975
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:34,800
Hello, please don't be an atlas. I'm gonna ship myself

1976
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:38,080
Ragnarok. No

1977
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:45,360
Oh, I don't I've forgotten his name, but he's not nice. He's really you can't be sure and I'm not even in the freaking game

1978
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:54,160
Stop stop stop pause stop. That's cheating. That's fucking cheating. Sorry. That's actually cheating

1979
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:57,440
You were shooting me in the cutscene

1980
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:01,280
Fuck off. Hold on. I'm overheating. Give me a second

1981
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:06,800
Oh, hold on. I can't aim. Fuck it. Sorry. I can't aim. We're getting through the lake part. Can you back up?

1982
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:11,200
Stop. Stop. I'm actually gonna lose right at the fucking end. Are you serious? Oh

1983
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:15,360
Oh

1984
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:24,480
I

1985
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Oh

1986
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:37,200
It's a score. Okay. Oh, you'll never guess why this mission was called Thor. You'll never get

1987
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,680
Hydration check. Oh my god. I almost lost that. I'm not being funny

1988
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,480
I'll handle this briefing

1989
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:49,840
Captain will have to restrict yourself from engaging the enemy

1990
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:54,240
I know this goes against everything you big tough mech warriors are taught

1991
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:57,120
Oh, it's an atlas. Oh my god, it's an atlas

1992
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:04,000
From inside we should be able to add to their comm center and see what information we can acquire about the orbital guns

1993
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:08,160
Then comes the part I haven't figured out how you get back

1994
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:16,480
Suddenly I'm glad I'm not a mech warrior. Oh, no, it's an atlas atlas is our tanky is anything

1995
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:23,840
My dad actually found a soft lock on this mission. He was so proud of himself when he showed me it

1996
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,040
Um, oh

1997
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:29,680
I'm actually getting nervous

1998
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:38,160
I'm getting nervous the Thor successfully blends heavy firepower with maneuverability and a heavy mix chassis

1999
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:43,920
Atlas casually doing what it does in lore making people shit their fans

2000
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:48,080
my my dad's favorite mech was atlas and

2001
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:52,240
Captain you're just outside of the base perimeter

2002
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:54,400
So

2003
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Okay, don't shoot

2004
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:06,160
Anyone and don't run over any tank either or a gentleman. Oh my god, they're tea posing. Look. I'm going. Look. I'm we tea posing

2005
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:13,680
Oh, he's animated but the other guy isn't yeah, so do not stand on anyone or you get obliterated to the moon

2006
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:16,320
So I'm literally not moving until this convoy goes away

2007
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:20,800
Okay

2008
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:27,680
Okay, I'm satisfied my aoe is not going to upset any of this

2009
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:35,840
Steady easy easy. No, I am a friendly

2010
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,120
Uh, yeah easy

2011
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:51,120
Easy, okay snowplow coming in easy easy. We don't want to upset the balance of anything

2012
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:57,280
I hope when strong he struggles you can just go. I'll literally get my dad on the phone right now

2013
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:03,440
Hold on Ray was safe to move

2014
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:07,920
We're going to take the the right side because there's nothing other right side

2015
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:11,760
Take it easy. Yes. We're friendly. Oh god

2016
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:15,600
Oh, I thought I was going to bounce me on his head. Oh, yeah

2017
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:17,680
Right easy

2018
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:19,680
Right stop

2019
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:21,840
Do I get runes? Oh crap gently

2020
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:27,680
Gently

2021
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:30,880
Gently

2022
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,800
Steady don't want to hurt the snowplow

2023
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:41,520
He's got taxes to pay you need to hold 30 back of your income for tax purposes most of the time is 30

2024
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:45,760
Easy

2025
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:49,040
Oh

2026
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,520
Ouch captain if they raise an alarm you best find the back door

2027
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:58,640
They've created you access now get near the comm center and pray

2028
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:02,960
Oh my god

2029
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:07,600
Oh my god, please leave me alone a I please they may suspect something play it cool

2030
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:11,920
I'm playing it cool. I'm getting ready to fucking gear up

2031
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:15,040
But I need to get near the comm center

2032
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:18,240
There should be like five clicks

2033
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:24,240
Stop AI is already targeting me. It's already targeting me

2034
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,400
Oh, no, what is the countdown for?

2035
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:36,880
Oh, sorry my apologies. Okay. Okay, panicking. I don't remember much this map

2036
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:43,760
Friendly Thor, please transmit your ID code. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh ID code

2037
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:48,480
We do not have the information yet to stay inside the base until we get the intel

2038
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:56,240
Again friendly Thor, please transmit the code

2039
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,240
Captain hang tight. We're almost there get ready to move out fast

2040
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:05,200
Where do I move out to?

2041
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:07,680
Almost

2042
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:09,680
Where

2043
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:18,720
I fucking wasn't ready. Is that the door? Hold on. I think the door is over here. Please let me out. Please let me out

2044
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:22,960
I don't want to go against an outlet. I'm scared. Oh, I'm gonna get some Alice. What did I do?

2045
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:29,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, like this not like this. How'd I get out? Oh, wait, I can fly I can fly

2046
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:37,040
No, I'm hay-bound. I'm hay-bound. Oh, no. I don't know where I'm supposed to go

2047
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:40,140
Alice that he go back over the Alice came from

2048
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:46,320
Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, wait, I'm supposed to destroy those. No, no, no

2049
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:50,480
I can get it

2050
02:38:55,760 --> 02:39:04,020
We just supposed to go the way the atlas came in okay restart

2051
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:17,740
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's get to it. I'm sure I can

2052
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:27,620
outpace everything. It implied the gates were going to open. It bloated, didn't. Was that

2053
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:33,420
supposed to go out those gates? Anyone here put Mexico? Either pass the atlases or blow

2054
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:40,780
up the generator to open the other gate or go back and... If I go out the atlases thing,

2055
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:47,620
I assume they want to fight me. I just want to make sure I don't upset any little ground

2056
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:55,340
soldier unit. I think the door... Oh my god, you have to... Right. At least not over the

2057
02:39:55,340 --> 02:40:02,660
generator's located, but... Did I even have the health to get out of there? Is my question...

2058
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:14,460
Okay. So... Okay. No alarm is raised. So begin... So go there and then I'm going to aim at the

2059
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:19,500
freaking generator and then I'm just gonna go for it because there's not much I can do.

2060
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:28,100
Okay. Right. Okay. And then the generator was around this corner. Okay. Okay. You don't need to tell me

2061
02:40:28,100 --> 02:40:34,980
that there's enemies. I know there's enemies. Are you winning? We got rigged. We got really

2062
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:39,180
badly rigged. They fight you either way. The atlas is gonna hit you with so many bullets for trying

2063
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:53,340
to get away. Yeah. Oh god. What's my B? Oh god. Yes. Yes. Friendly. I'm friendly. I'm friendly. I'm

2064
02:40:53,340 --> 02:41:03,260
friendly. I'm so nervous and scared. I'm freaking trying. I'm in position four, three, two, one.

2065
02:41:09,820 --> 02:41:17,020
Uh-huh. Okay. I'm hiding behind this for now. Open. Please open. Please open. Please open. Please

2066
02:41:17,020 --> 02:41:28,780
open. Please open. Are you fucking serious? Open! I'm going, but I'm so slow. What does this mean?

2067
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:37,260
I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Oh god. Please close the gates behind me. Please close the gates

2068
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:42,620
behind me. I beg of you. Be close the gate or something. I don't know. Ring the guards.

2069
02:41:42,620 --> 02:41:52,620
Anything. Please. There's too many of them. I can't do it. Oh my god. This is getting worse. There's

2070
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:57,260
an enemy ahead. Oh, but there's health on the road. Okay. Okay. The guards have been rang. The guards

2071
02:41:57,260 --> 02:42:06,780
have been rang. Fight. Fucking gone. You didn't have to tell me twice, darling. I'm fucking gone.

2072
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:15,420
I'm with the wind. I'm with the sky. I hate these kind of omissions. Oh god. Right. We're getting

2073
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:19,100
farther. We're getting farther. That's the main thing. Okay. Across the bridge. Across the bridge.

2074
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:23,500
Surely, I have to get across the bridge. There's only one way through. The only way out is through

2075
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:29,660
a heavily breamed port to be ravine. Follow this in an actual application point. Down there. Oh,

2076
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:36,540
shy saw. I'm one HP in a dream. How is I supposed to win this? I'm going to have to look up a tutorial.

2077
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:46,140
Whoa. I'm dead. Whoa. Is that supposed to go down the river? I think I'm going down the river.

2078
02:42:53,660 --> 02:42:58,300
Wait. All I have to do, I don't actually have to do anything. I just have to reach the extraction

2079
02:42:58,300 --> 02:43:06,140
point. Hmm. Curious. Curious. The trucks dropped the hill. You've made good progress.

2080
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:09,340
That was a good attempt. I think I'm to go bottom right at that river.

2081
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:15,100
Oh, the trucks dropped health. The trucks. Okay, trucks. Look for a truck.

2082
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:21,260
I think that path was right. There was a natural cover around the bend. Okay.

2083
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:29,740
Just around the river bend. Strony, maybe time to ask your dad what he did. Honestly,

2084
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:33,180
I don't remember him playing this mission a lot, so I don't think he enjoyed it.

2085
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:43,500
Which I'm not even trying to agree with his taste in mission because WTF, mate.

2086
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:54,140
We need mission control. Papacult is mission control. Right, let's go.

2087
02:43:56,140 --> 02:44:02,780
That took so long for the gate to open. I'm going to hide behind the generator this time,

2088
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:09,740
so I don't take any damage at all. Counter started. I'm going to go behind the generator this time.

2089
02:44:15,500 --> 02:44:20,700
There is a health pack right there. Can I shoot? I'm wondering if I should take that off on the way out.

2090
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:24,220
Okay, right side, there's a health pack when I leave. Oh, this truck has health.

2091
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:33,660
ID code. What do you mean comply? Get ready to move out. Okay, green trucks have health in it.

2092
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:42,540
Who do you think, huh? Okay. Three, two, one, go. I'm fucking trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

2093
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:47,660
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Fucking hell, this is

2094
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:52,940
generator. Have someone come see. Oh, come on. Break already.

2095
02:44:56,140 --> 02:45:00,380
Oh, is it broken? Okay, okay. So what, do you give me health?

2096
02:45:02,140 --> 02:45:09,260
You're a lie. Okay, okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine that there's two atlases locked onto me.

2097
02:45:10,140 --> 02:45:14,460
It's not a problem at all, as if that building could support the weight of my mech.

2098
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:20,780
Sorry, my mech is far too heavy for it. Oh, no, it just takes so much damage because I walked into

2099
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:24,060
that structure. Oh, my God, there's three heal stations.

2100
02:45:28,860 --> 02:45:33,180
Wait, do you have health? Or is it the other ones that have health? Who the fuck is sniping me from

2101
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:41,740
the sky? I can't get a break, bro. I don't think I can actually do this. You, you, give me the health.

2102
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:50,860
Give me the health. You don't understand. You don't understand. You are mine. You are mine. Give

2103
02:45:50,860 --> 02:45:56,540
me the health right now. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Great. Okay, health on the bridge.

2104
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:07,180
The only way, oh, I got stuck on that turret again. Oh, God, I'm like one health already. I'm half

2105
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:11,500
health already. Please stop shitting me. Oh, there's a green truck ahead. Get the truck.

2106
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:15,820
Get the truck. Beat it up. Give me that truck. Give me that HP right now. Give me that health.

2107
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:21,180
Fuck you. Beach. Fuck you, beach. Fuck you. Just think I won't do it.

2108
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:27,420
God, that thing has some health on it. Wait, I'm supposed to go down. Wait, I'm confused. No,

2109
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:32,220
up. Go up. Go up. Wait, give me a truck. Give me a truck. I'm half health. Give me a truck. Come on.

2110
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:36,460
Come on. Let me get a range. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2111
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:41,900
I'm so good at this health. There's health. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it.

2112
02:46:41,900 --> 02:46:48,780
Shit. Shit's a base. Shit's a bomb car. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh, there's another one.

2113
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:53,340
Oh, we're going to make it. We're going to make it. I have hope. I have hope. Fricking shoot it,

2114
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:57,420
though. Oh, wait, sorry. I'm flying. Wait, that's why I can't shoot it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm

2115
02:46:57,420 --> 02:47:04,300
panicking. Panicking. Right. You. Fuck off. Oh, God, there's a new makeup ahead. No,

2116
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:11,420
you're not supposed to do that. Stop. Stop. You're making me so stressed. Oh, I see health. I see

2117
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:18,540
health. I see. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I'm doing great. Yeah. Yeah,

2118
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:23,900
I'm not panicking at all. I'm not panicking at all. It's fine. It's fine. No, I'm MLG at this game.

2119
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:30,860
It's fine. Oh, God, the HUD is breaking. The HUD is breaking. Why? There's so much. Okay, I see green.

2120
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:35,500
I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see lots of green. I

2121
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:40,540
actually quite like seeing this much green. I have to admit, this is pretty cool. Yes, you better

2122
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:47,900
have a plan to get me out. Okay, okay. Destroy the bridge when I'm on the other side. Oh, that's a

2123
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:55,420
freaking atlas. It's an atlas. It's an atlas. But break the bridge. Break the bridge. Break the bridge.

2124
02:47:55,420 --> 02:48:02,060
I'm on the other side of the bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. Destroy the

2125
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:11,660
bridge. The motherfucking bridge. Oh, you suck so bad. Why do you suck so bad? Oh, no. Oh, no, it's

2126
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:20,700
all coming. Oh, why are you not destroying? No, don't lock onto the atlas. Fuck it. No, not like

2127
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:26,620
this. Not like this. Oh, no, I have to destroy the bridge to progress. Why? Why would you do

2128
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:34,540
this to me video game? Why? The bridge was hardly breaking. I was so close to dying. I was so close.

2129
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:46,220
No, I can't 1v1 a fucking atlas. No, why does the bridge die? Why does the ace have so much

2130
02:48:46,220 --> 02:48:53,420
damage? Why does the bridge have so much HP?

2131
02:48:56,060 --> 02:49:03,500
Because the rocket did very little damage? Yeah, well, your mom. I did it. I won the game.

2132
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:12,300
I won that fucking mission. You suck. You stinky game. You know I blew up that bridge.

2133
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:14,700
Freakin' have to use something else.

2134
02:49:17,980 --> 02:49:24,620
This make only fires two at a time. So much for having make superiority with this one. It sucks.

2135
02:49:32,300 --> 02:49:35,740
Stony, your spam flying is slowing you down a lot and overheating you.

2136
02:49:35,740 --> 02:49:39,500
Oh, but I feel like if I fly, they don't hit me as much.

2137
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:44,620
Shoot the bridge as you walk across it because it has so much. Okay, I agree with this

2138
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:51,020
sentence. I approve of this message. Oh, excuse me. Sorry, you didn't see that. I promise I'm

2139
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:54,380
trained in this make and I haven't just put it on for the first, I haven't been inside it for the

2140
02:49:54,380 --> 02:50:00,700
first time. Great. I will use X in zero.

2141
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:07,900
Oh, let me reset.

2142
02:50:13,420 --> 02:50:18,940
I freaking bumped a building. I'm in a massive make. Fucking give me a chance. How did I get

2143
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:23,820
even worse? Literally, I kicked it. If you hit every health pick up along the way and just run

2144
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:30,380
serpentine, it'll be enough to get you there. Okay, okay, okay. We can do it. We can do it.

2145
02:50:30,620 --> 02:50:34,140
We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We want.

2146
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:38,700
Yeah, missiles have the least damage against these. The laser works better.

2147
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:45,900
Great. I can do it. I have faith. If there's any doubters,

2148
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:54,220
then doubters will be recommended to go watch V-Slammy V-Tubers instead of

2149
02:50:54,220 --> 02:51:01,980
Viller Beach. Oh, that's so stressful. Right, stop flying. It slows me down.

2150
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:06,620
Okay, I can do this and I can not hit a building on the way there.

2151
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:12,140
All I have to do is not spank a building and then I just need to run.

2152
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:21,340
I'm sure someone's probably done this where he has killed everything before. I'd actually

2153
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:29,020
be very curious to see if someone's got gameplay of that. Okay. Stop AI locking onto me. You smell.

2154
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:31,660
I know what you're doing. I know what you are.

2155
02:51:34,220 --> 02:51:35,660
Oh, hold on. Okay.

2156
02:51:38,620 --> 02:51:43,820
Right, we're hacking into the comms unit. Slime arachnid V-Tuber with only one eye and a green

2157
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:49,900
skin, surely. Would we be able to do this mission on the first try? I said mods. Take that man out

2158
02:51:49,900 --> 02:51:59,740
for 10 seconds. How dare he speak like that to me. How dare. Okay, we can do this. There's a

2159
02:51:59,740 --> 02:52:04,620
little green truck here. If I really need it, then there's also a green one.

2160
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:13,980
I'm so terrified about it. You have got this, I believe in you. This is it. This is the run.

2161
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:17,340
This is the run because I'm using my X now.

2162
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:35,020
Okay, that was so much quicker. Right, don't use your fly. Stop panicking. Stop flying. Use it.

2163
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:39,980
Okay, I can do that. I can do that. Right, hold on. We'll get some coverage going through here.

2164
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:46,300
Pardon me, coming through. Okay, and then there's a health station to the left as I come out here.

2165
02:52:47,500 --> 02:52:52,860
Oh my gosh, did I just mess up again? Oh, I think so.

2166
02:52:54,700 --> 02:52:55,740
Oh, I'm running.

2167
02:52:58,380 --> 02:53:03,260
Why did they have to make such a stressful mission? You! Give me, oh wait, there's one here too.

2168
02:53:04,220 --> 02:53:06,380
Right, and then you're next. You're next.

2169
02:53:08,300 --> 02:53:16,140
I'm fate. What fate? I'm fucking getting annihilated. There is no fate. There's only death and

2170
02:53:17,020 --> 02:53:22,220
stinkiness. Is there even a health station? There isn't. Oh, you're the health pack. Okay, I found you.

2171
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:28,460
Right, I can shoot the bridge as I go along it because, no, not this one, the next bridge. Sorry.

2172
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:35,020
Next bridge, next bridge. Oh, something just splattered me for heavy. I don't know what it was, but it got me good.

2173
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:37,340
Okay, okay.

2174
02:53:39,100 --> 02:53:49,180
Oh, ow, ow, that actually took a decent considerable chunk of damage. Ow, please stop, please stop.

2175
02:53:49,180 --> 02:53:53,580
Please, I'm such a good feature, I'm such a good feature bird. Please, please,

2176
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:57,820
God, stop taking tick damage. It's all I ask, please.

2177
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:04,060
Stop it. I don't even know what the pylons do when they spot you. Oh god, there's one there.

2178
02:54:04,060 --> 02:54:09,740
Wait, well, why did all the other freaking mechas time out? Okay, one's on, one's hot on my R-Streets.

2179
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:14,300
I don't even know if I can pick this up. You can't even beat over Healed Canyon in those games. No,

2180
02:54:14,300 --> 02:54:19,580
you can't. I'm full health. Okay, take it as a blessing. I'm full health. I'm full health. Take it as a blessing.

2181
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:22,620
Oh yeah, I'm full health. I'm full health. I don't fucking care.

2182
02:54:24,300 --> 02:54:29,420
Go away. I don't know what the wee towers do, but I'm going for it. I'm going for it. I'm trying my best.

2183
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:41,660
I'm a good little mate, and I am doing great. Thank you. Okay, where the fuck do I go?

2184
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:46,940
Hello? Should I fuck up? I'll weave it. I'll weave it. It's okay. Back on course, back on course, back on

2185
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:52,220
course. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up. Okay, I see it. I see the hell.

2186
02:54:52,220 --> 02:55:00,060
Ah, no game. Don't break now. I'm almost there. Don't do that to me. Don't be so selfish. Okay.

2187
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:14,380
Okay. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm breaking free. I'm solving. I'm trying.

2188
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:24,060
There's not a bridge. There's gaining. Freaking. Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Pop already.

2189
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:34,220
Come on. Come on. Yes. Fucking shove up your ass. Atlas. Fucking bam.

2190
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:39,500
Can you get this one too? I don't know if I need to do this one too, but I think I'm okay. Okay.

2191
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:48,220
Okay. Oh my god, we did it. We just need to destroy this one, which I can do. Oh my god,

2192
02:55:48,220 --> 02:55:56,380
we did it. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. Oh, we did it.

2193
02:55:59,100 --> 02:55:59,900
Oh.

2194
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:05,340
Wait a second. Holy crap. Sirs, I know what the word of Blake is doing on this planet.

2195
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:11,340
They found some sort of lost technology cache and something called Ragnarok.

2196
02:56:11,340 --> 02:56:19,660
No. I'm going to signal the other dragoons. Ragnarok is even scarier than Atlas.

2197
02:56:21,180 --> 02:56:24,940
Oh, no. We know where the guns are. Now we need to stop them before the invasions of the

2198
02:56:25,180 --> 02:56:29,180
dragons are on. Wait, isn't the dragon the name of Dokey Bird?

2199
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:37,340
Oh, she got a new outfit. And a familiar model.

2200
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:46,700
Work your way towards the orbital gun any way you can and then destroy the gun.

2201
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:49,740
Oh, it's letting me pick.

2202
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:57,260
I'm going to say I didn't actually enjoy Thor that much, but Timberwolf.

2203
02:56:59,020 --> 02:57:05,180
Timberwolf has so much spray and pray though with those things. I'll try with Timber,

2204
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:09,420
if not, I'll take on the other one. You don't remember the Ragnarok? Okay,

2205
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:11,580
so think of Thor and then change everything by two.

2206
02:57:16,780 --> 02:57:18,380
I like how they cut coms on him.

2207
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:25,260
Right. Again, we might lose it.

2208
02:57:25,900 --> 02:57:29,740
Sir, you're going to face stiff defense. You may be able to skirt around the worst

2209
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:33,900
of it with a maneuverable mech. I don't care what you do, Captain. Get those guns.

2210
02:57:33,900 --> 02:57:39,180
We have a tamer. If they eat the worst, well, well, well,

2211
02:57:39,180 --> 02:57:43,420
if there's in the worst kind of game, well, they can give you a fricking tamed mission.

2212
02:57:44,380 --> 02:57:47,500
Right. I can't fly. Maybe I should.

2213
02:57:51,740 --> 02:57:53,260
Shit. Nothing's open. Huh?

2214
02:57:55,340 --> 02:58:02,060
I can't fly. Wait. I softlocked myself because I have something that can't fly.

2215
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:05,020
Stop. Wait, can I destroy these walls?

2216
02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:13,900
Can I open this door for Mimi? I'd appreciate that.

2217
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:23,340
I think I, unironically, think I need to start with the new mech.

2218
02:58:24,700 --> 02:58:28,140
Right. Okay, hold on. Quit mission. Yeah.

2219
02:58:29,500 --> 02:58:33,100
And then, okay, it was under the guns. We know where the guns are.

2220
02:58:33,100 --> 02:58:37,580
Right. That's fine. And then give me mad cat, I guess.

2221
02:58:37,580 --> 02:58:41,580
Mad cat. Well, Thor can fly as well.

2222
02:58:41,580 --> 02:58:44,300
Sir, the new tool we're receiving is the heavy firepower.

2223
02:58:44,300 --> 02:58:48,620
Straight through with one of our big gun mechs or take a jump capable mech and skirt around

2224
02:58:48,620 --> 02:58:53,900
the edge of the base. Your call. Time is of the essence. The other dragoons are counting on you.

2225
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:57,340
I'll try mad cat. See behind. Wait, mad cat can't fly.

2226
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:05,580
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry. Let's try that again. Mad cat can't fly. Thor can fly.

2227
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:09,580
We will pick Thor. Dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb.

2228
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:13,900
We know where the guns are. One more time for the, one more time from the top.

2229
02:59:13,900 --> 02:59:19,980
Thor can fly. So we can fly over. Wow. You didn't think it was that hard.

2230
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:24,860
Don't forget, lasers are the structure busters. You can break the door.

2231
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:32,300
I didn't know that. Right. Hold on. We're using the laser beam. I'm a fire on the laser.

2232
02:59:32,300 --> 02:59:37,340
Right. I'm going to all lock onto the retanks because it's just so much easier all alone.

2233
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:43,180
Whoa. This hardly does any damage on the all alone. Man, I want a mad cat so bad. They do so much

2234
02:59:43,180 --> 02:59:53,260
damage like all alone. I mean, I like not having to try sometimes. Is that, is that so hard?

2235
02:59:54,060 --> 03:00:01,420
Yes, you're a dumb, dumb, but you're a dumb, dumb, affectionately, affectionately, affectionately,

2236
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:05,180
though. Okay. So there's a health pack. I know a mad cat comes in. There's actually two health packs.

2237
03:00:06,460 --> 03:00:12,300
That's a lot of resistance. Wow.

2238
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:23,660
Oh, here. I mean, this is, this is all locking on him pretty quickly. I have to say, I have to say,

2239
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:29,740
it's not, oh, that was some juicy damage he just did there. I don't know what my ultimate is,

2240
03:00:29,740 --> 03:00:38,300
but I'll use it anyway. Wait, he's even sparking yet. I feel like I've done, who the fuck is shooting

2241
03:00:38,540 --> 03:00:41,420
that? Fuck off! Honestly, doing my fucking hits in.

2242
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:52,620
Hold on, let me please redeem his ass. Oh, sugar. I'm out of, um, oh, he's limping?

2243
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:56,860
Is he limping? I think we're doing it. I think we're doing it. Okay. God, this is taking far too

2244
03:00:56,860 --> 03:01:01,980
long. I think I'm wasting so much time doing this. Like, game-wise, I should not be doing,

2245
03:01:01,980 --> 03:01:07,260
oh my God, he's literally about to get, about to get each other. We're actually having like a decent

2246
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:15,500
break, yeah. And there's an enemy behind me. What the heck? What am I supposed to do? Oh,

2247
03:01:15,500 --> 03:01:24,460
I'm supposed to go north? Oh, fuck off. Right, you, fuck you. I don't, uh, I don't know if I should

2248
03:01:24,460 --> 03:01:30,060
send it or not, but given you a timed mission, surely the game devs wouldn't be so evil to give

2249
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:34,060
you a timed mission and then give you a billion mechs in front of you for the past, so you're

2250
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:37,740
perfectly run out of time and you have to redo the whole 15-minute mission again.

2251
03:01:38,460 --> 03:01:44,460
Surely. Surely for an old ass, I don't even know when this game came out. I probably wasn't even

2252
03:01:44,460 --> 03:01:58,380
born when I came out. No, I can't do it. Maybe. Because I never played it when I watched my dad

2253
03:01:58,700 --> 03:02:05,580
run out of time. Can a mech be left alone to do their job exactly? Is this the right way?

2254
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:10,300
No, this is just a fiber.

2255
03:02:12,940 --> 03:02:22,220
Me. How do I, do I fly? Oh, I can fly. Oh, it's fantastic.

2256
03:02:23,100 --> 03:02:30,540
Uh, yeah, I think I've taken some kind of shortcut to the mountain. The good news.

2257
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:36,060
Uh, okay, okay, okay.

2258
03:02:41,900 --> 03:02:44,060
I am a little bit sparky.

2259
03:02:44,380 --> 03:02:59,100
Okay, okay. Okay, I know there's a mech down there. Hold on. Hold on, you're next, mate. Hold on.

2260
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:06,380
Oh, are you freaking serious? Uh, can't be arsed when the AI is like hiding. Oh, and I just took a

2261
03:03:06,380 --> 03:03:12,940
direct hit off something. Lovely. Oh, I don't know if I should be fighting you or not. Oh no.

2262
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:20,700
Right, you're just backing off. I don't know why. Sorry, mate, it was not working.

2263
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:30,300
I think the laser's on when you put that down. Sorry. Please just take these direct hits, please.

2264
03:03:30,940 --> 03:03:39,660
I'm begging, please so I can pick up your freaking health. I need it. I need it. I need it. Give me

2265
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:48,460
your health. Okay, we're just kind of, yeah, okay, we're just gonna do this, yeah? I'm trying.

2266
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:58,380
He's not perishing. Okay, there we go. Give me that health. Give me that health. Okay, I'll pick it.

2267
03:03:58,380 --> 03:04:05,260
Yeah, and you guys are fucking next. We're slowly getting damaged in the middle of that fight.

2268
03:04:07,740 --> 03:04:11,900
Uh, we're doing the wrong way. I'm supposed to be going this week. Can you take fall damage?

2269
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:18,700
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky. Uh, literally, uh, the guy knew it was inevitable.

2270
03:04:18,700 --> 03:04:25,260
Right, another mech, but I can see the cannon. Okay, there you are. Fuck me. That's not good.

2271
03:04:26,220 --> 03:04:30,940
You guys are so cheap. Like, why do you guys get two, but I only get one?

2272
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:41,500
The boys? Captain, help me out, question mark. The mad cat is currently going around me to

2273
03:04:41,500 --> 03:04:46,380
sandwich me. Can you see it on the hard bottom left? The mad cat is going around to freaking

2274
03:04:46,380 --> 03:04:49,660
sandwich me. I'm not even kidding. Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to move into this health part.

2275
03:04:51,980 --> 03:04:57,260
Yeah, the mad cat is getting me from behind. I'm not happy with that. I don't know.

2276
03:05:00,700 --> 03:05:09,500
No, do not randomly swap fucking magazines for that. Oh, come on. Call the weak guy at least.

2277
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:18,140
Sir. Oh, I'm running out of time. Oh, I'm completely out of fucking. Oh.

2278
03:05:20,860 --> 03:05:27,660
Oh, face of maneuvers. A face of maneuvers. That's so loud behind me. Please stop. Please stop.

2279
03:05:28,460 --> 03:05:35,420
Hold on. I'm over the edge. Oh, but when I jump, right, blow them up. No, I didn't do any

2280
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:41,500
freaking environmental damage against them. I would very much like to win this mission in one go.

2281
03:05:41,500 --> 03:05:44,060
I do not want to replay this mission. I'm going to be honest.

2282
03:05:52,060 --> 03:05:59,580
I took, like, so much direct damage there. I'm so, the overheat is, like, punishing me so hard right

2283
03:05:59,580 --> 03:06:05,500
now. And, of course, I never made it. I was a waste of time. Oh, right. Hold on. He's smoking.

2284
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:11,420
He's smoking. That's what you get for smoking. Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna have to jump this

2285
03:06:11,980 --> 03:06:18,620
chicken wall to not get hit by this fight again. Hold on. Oh, I need to get over. There we go.

2286
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:25,260
Fuck you. Fuck you. I need to kill. Oh, I'm going to get direct hit off the spam.

2287
03:06:25,980 --> 03:06:31,500
How much have I got? About eight minutes to destroy this and the next one. I don't like mods.

2288
03:06:32,140 --> 03:06:36,780
Yeah, you better start limping. You have, you have, limping, limping, limping.

2289
03:06:40,060 --> 03:06:42,940
Fucking destroy this. I've got seven minutes to find the last one.

2290
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:52,140
Oh, sorry. Right. Hold on. Where is it? Where? Where? Where? Where? This way? It says this way. Hold on.

2291
03:06:53,100 --> 03:06:57,180
If I go up. Oh, there it is. Oh, my God. There it is. It's right there. Holy crap. We can do it.

2292
03:06:57,180 --> 03:07:02,060
We can do it in one. We can do it in one. Now, let it spawn eight billion mints all at once for me to

2293
03:07:02,060 --> 03:07:05,980
perish. Sorry, you're going down. You're actually going down. I don't care what you're shooting at me.

2294
03:07:05,980 --> 03:07:11,580
You're going down first. Whoo. The orbital guns were our primary mission, but we got another one from upstairs.

2295
03:07:11,580 --> 03:07:17,500
So they aren't our yet. The Icarus isn't fixed enough to get us off-planet, but it can move us around.

2296
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:22,780
Command wants us to figure out what this Ragnarok is and seize the lost technology

2297
03:07:22,780 --> 03:07:27,740
while the rest of the vehicles are at the word of Blake here. So we're off to a hellish wasteland

2298
03:07:27,740 --> 03:07:34,620
of lava and dust storms. Once more into the breach, A-Tiger. Once more. I'd rather be. We did it.

2299
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:41,260
Whoa, we did it. Oh, they give you like double the time. Okay. The new case of our mission.

2300
03:07:41,980 --> 03:07:46,460
What's the name of this mission? Size Mars? Gambling, whatever floats your boat.

2301
03:07:46,540 --> 03:07:52,380
Size Mars. We did it. I'm so glad. If you just need the last one, you can take your

2302
03:07:52,380 --> 03:07:56,700
odds and bomb us. As you know, we are en route to the wasteland. We have received some intel that

2303
03:07:56,700 --> 03:08:03,180
got me thinking, and I have a plan. Oh, great. First, we have an old two-power armor in

2304
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:08,540
hold. Captain, you are just the right size. That added to the fact that we've learned that

2305
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:13,660
a number of word of Blake dignitariers are having some sort of celebration during an invasion.

2306
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:20,460
Remember that time I actually did the plan. In this power armor, their sensors won't pick you up.

2307
03:08:20,460 --> 03:08:26,140
The bad guys won't go on full alert. You will face defenders just not their whole force. Get

2308
03:08:26,140 --> 03:08:30,860
through their base and find their mechs. Steal one, and then you'll be inside their defenses,

2309
03:08:30,860 --> 03:08:34,300
giving them hell before they know it. Steal a mech. Move through the small city,

2310
03:08:34,300 --> 03:08:39,420
demolish the regional palace, and crash their little party. What can I say? Brilliant.

2311
03:08:40,380 --> 03:08:47,660
Steal a mech. Can I steal an alice? Elemental, a suit of powered... Oh, that makes me want to play

2312
03:08:47,660 --> 03:08:54,060
cameo. Sorry. A suit of powered battle armor. An elemental is no match for mechs in single...

2313
03:08:54,060 --> 03:08:59,580
Who goes out? Combat. Hmm. Hmm. My size matters.

2314
03:08:59,580 --> 03:09:03,260
Let me defense should be minimal, though I recommend you stay away from combat.

2315
03:09:03,260 --> 03:09:16,540
Whoa, I'm so cute. Oh my god. I'm so cool. Oh, look at me go. Oh, I'm so fast. Holy crap. Like,

2316
03:09:16,540 --> 03:09:23,900
but I don't have much thrusters to me. Oh, I'm so cute. Oh, sorry. Wait, what are you...

2317
03:09:23,900 --> 03:09:33,740
What even armor? Is something shooting me? There is. Whoa, I can hear it.

2318
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:43,660
What did I do?

2319
03:09:43,660 --> 03:09:48,460
What sort of scraps do I...

2320
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:55,660
I hear. Whoa, I have so much lift.

2321
03:09:59,660 --> 03:10:06,220
Scissors and enemy over here. Whoa. Okay, thank goodness fall damage in a mech suit isn't a thing,

2322
03:10:06,220 --> 03:10:11,660
because... There's something red over here, so I assume that's where I'm supposed to go.

2323
03:10:11,900 --> 03:10:23,820
Whoa. Whoa, who, who, who, who? Oh my god, so this is what it's like to be like a tiny

2324
03:10:23,820 --> 03:10:33,740
big round unit. Okay, we got him. Who next? Wait, I didn't get him. It's so rich.

2325
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:35,740
Wow.

2326
03:10:43,740 --> 03:10:44,380
Up here?

2327
03:10:47,500 --> 03:10:51,340
Sorry, I don't really have much of a recollection of this at all.

2328
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:55,340
Oh.

2329
03:11:00,620 --> 03:11:08,460
Am I going too fast for you? Too bad. Plop, plop, plop, plop. Oh, there's a wee baby one.

2330
03:11:08,460 --> 03:11:17,180
That's what we're fainting. Okay, hold on, wait, wait, hold on, let me get into the fight.

2331
03:11:17,900 --> 03:11:21,420
Geeze, is this Out of Bones? Is that why? I think this might be Out of Bones and

2332
03:11:21,420 --> 03:11:26,300
he's like an invisible wall. Well, I got a lick off on someone. Oh crap, how'd I get around?

2333
03:11:27,900 --> 03:11:34,460
Sir, I'm reading an incoming mech. Somewhere. It must be using no sig. Captain, you can't fight him.

2334
03:11:34,460 --> 03:11:41,020
Get a move on. No, no, don't give me a run and map again. I get too stressed out when you give me

2335
03:11:41,020 --> 03:11:50,780
run maps. Wait, what the heck am I supposed to...? Something's dying behind me. I'm so confused

2336
03:11:50,780 --> 03:11:59,420
where I'm supposed to go. I'm so sorry, guys. This door? Okay, is this like maybe a generator

2337
03:11:59,420 --> 03:12:04,940
to open a door? There's two mechs after me now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can hear it freaking

2338
03:12:04,940 --> 03:12:09,660
charging up against me. You just relaxed me. What am I supposed to do?

2339
03:12:12,380 --> 03:12:17,980
Sorry, I'm probably gonna die, but it's too too confusing rather than being bad.

2340
03:12:18,620 --> 03:12:23,260
Well, I am bad, but I don't... Is there something back there?

2341
03:12:26,620 --> 03:12:28,700
Was I supposed to kill a generator?

2342
03:12:28,860 --> 03:12:39,100
Huh. There's three. Just run, but run where? Oh, shit.

2343
03:12:42,700 --> 03:12:47,180
Oh, my, my gear is on for registering now. Oh, okay, it's registering again. Hold on.

2344
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:53,900
Am I just wee enough that they can't shoot me? Well, they can shoot me a wee bit, but where am I?

2345
03:12:54,700 --> 03:13:00,860
Sorry, sorry. Let me just focus on the map detail, because they wouldn't put sections in the map

2346
03:13:00,860 --> 03:13:07,580
if they weren't supposed to go near it, kind of. Right, so it is that gate, but how do I get over it?

2347
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:10,540
All right, I'm low health, that's all.

2348
03:13:13,740 --> 03:13:16,780
You mean you're confused because of how good I am at the same exact...

2349
03:13:17,660 --> 03:13:22,620
Is it... And before it just opens... Oh, for fuck's sake! Come on!

2350
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:35,020
As if that was the solution! I was joking! Oh, of course it was. I wasted so much health,

2351
03:13:35,020 --> 03:13:40,060
no. I don't know if I'll make it run through. Yeah, they don't even drop health because we're so

2352
03:13:40,060 --> 03:13:51,500
Chinese. Oh, well, oh well. Okay, we'll try again next run. At least we know the gate opens.

2353
03:13:52,380 --> 03:13:56,300
Good job, sir. Had me sweating. You were sweating, briefing boy.

2354
03:14:03,660 --> 03:14:06,220
Let me guess, this break, it kind of looked breakable.

2355
03:14:08,300 --> 03:14:12,700
Or not. Oh, it's a shame they don't give you a health pack anywhere.

2356
03:14:14,060 --> 03:14:16,940
Right, we'll know much better than for next time.

2357
03:14:21,500 --> 03:14:26,380
Hmm. Okay, so come down the lava path, they take a little lift.

2358
03:14:26,380 --> 03:14:30,460
When in doubt, just walk out. Once again, Stroney assumes she can't go somewhere without trying.

2359
03:14:30,460 --> 03:14:35,020
I mean, every other part of the game has been like, you can't go there, you must destroy

2360
03:14:35,020 --> 03:14:49,340
something in order to do it. So, XK is... So, as I was saying, XK is me.

2361
03:14:50,300 --> 03:14:53,900
For, um, assuming otherwise.

2362
03:15:00,300 --> 03:15:03,420
I am definitely getting Kablamo's, like, right now by that guy.

2363
03:15:07,580 --> 03:15:15,980
In a cavern. Secret cavern. Secret cavern. Fly away from the loofy.

2364
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:21,180
The Cougar. Secret, secret, secret, secret cavern.

2365
03:15:23,260 --> 03:15:26,780
How am I doing this on one HP? Seriously, drop me at least one HP.

2366
03:15:26,780 --> 03:15:29,820
Like, don't be shy, game. Don't be shy. Drop me one HP.

2367
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:43,420
All of it? All of it feels good, man. Have I cornered myself? Be honest.

2368
03:15:45,980 --> 03:15:48,860
I haven't cornered myself. I need to keep going. Keep going.

2369
03:15:49,580 --> 03:15:51,980
We're breaking free. We're so good.

2370
03:15:55,820 --> 03:15:57,500
There's no a-me-king.

2371
03:15:59,820 --> 03:16:03,500
Uh, a tank. I can handle a tank in my wee baby armor.

2372
03:16:03,500 --> 03:16:06,940
I can handle a tank. Look, Zia, just scream free.

2373
03:16:08,620 --> 03:16:11,500
I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying.

2374
03:16:12,140 --> 03:16:17,420
See? All is good. This game, I ain't got nothing to worry about in my little elemental guy.

2375
03:16:17,420 --> 03:16:22,540
I'm so tiny and cute, okay? I need to stop flying. I need to destroy these guys.

2376
03:16:22,540 --> 03:16:28,700
Wait, there's someone behind me? It's Zia! Naughty. You're not supposed to go behind me.

2377
03:16:31,020 --> 03:16:33,500
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I don't have infinite health.

2378
03:16:34,220 --> 03:16:38,700
If you could all just group up and stop and start missing your shots, that would be great.

2379
03:16:38,780 --> 03:16:41,820
Please, group up and start missing your shots. Thank you.

2380
03:16:43,260 --> 03:16:47,340
This has been... Oh no, the cougar is coming up to me.

2381
03:16:48,380 --> 03:16:50,540
Better get a move on. The cougar is chasing me.

2382
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:58,620
P.O.V., you're a college boy in the classic American popcorn film.

2383
03:16:58,620 --> 03:17:00,300
The cougar is coming for me.

2384
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:06,860
See? See? They said blast the building because the gate is controlled by it.

2385
03:17:09,260 --> 03:17:13,180
Does that actually mean that, or did it not mean that? Oh, this, sorry.

2386
03:17:14,380 --> 03:17:19,420
The comb's coming. Let me in. What's in here? Other than...

2387
03:17:20,540 --> 03:17:27,900
Jackpot, kid in a candy store. Captain, um, Captain, stop window shopping. The Atlas will do fine.

2388
03:17:29,900 --> 03:17:33,740
Atlas time! Let's see how we do with this stop, boy.

2389
03:17:34,700 --> 03:17:41,100
Whoa. Hello. Daddy's home.

2390
03:17:49,900 --> 03:17:53,740
Okay, let's see. Oh, next mission.

2391
03:17:53,980 --> 03:18:00,460
No, still same. Still same.

2392
03:18:06,220 --> 03:18:07,260
I remember.

2393
03:18:13,420 --> 03:18:15,580
Okay, I don't want to waste too much ammo on that stuff.

2394
03:18:16,460 --> 03:18:17,900
Okay.

2395
03:18:21,980 --> 03:18:23,500
Oh, one hit, baby.

2396
03:18:28,220 --> 03:18:29,820
Well, I bet he regrets it now.

2397
03:18:33,740 --> 03:18:36,060
Show em' this. Size max.

2398
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:36,940
Whoa, it's probably the...

2399
03:18:39,660 --> 03:18:40,780
Wait, hold on. How do I aim?

2400
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:45,500
Okay. Holy. Holy schmooze.

2401
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:48,940
Holy schmooze. No, back up. I hate when they do that.

2402
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:55,900
Stop. Hey, dang.

2403
03:18:57,980 --> 03:19:02,940
I'm overheating. Oh, my God. The Atlas has very limited mobility.

2404
03:19:02,940 --> 03:19:06,700
Holy crap. Like, even turning to look at him? Very limited.

2405
03:19:07,660 --> 03:19:09,260
Okay. Enough out of YouTube.

2406
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:13,020
Jeez. Let's see what we got here.

2407
03:19:15,980 --> 03:19:19,100
Okay, there we go. Yeah, the mobility is like,

2408
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:20,940
whoa, it's rough trying to do it.

2409
03:19:20,940 --> 03:19:23,260
But I actually like that detail being like,

2410
03:19:23,260 --> 03:19:26,220
oh, I almost fell into the lava. You didn't see that.

2411
03:19:26,220 --> 03:19:29,660
And I like that it feels like, oh, you know.

2412
03:19:30,380 --> 03:19:32,860
The only thing about that was we caught him napping.

2413
03:19:32,860 --> 03:19:34,700
Punch through that weakened wall section.

2414
03:19:34,780 --> 03:19:36,700
We caught him napping? Sure.

2415
03:19:39,980 --> 03:19:41,820
Right, let's see what we're up against.

2416
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:44,140
Right, it's a few tanks. Nothing that I can't even do.

2417
03:19:45,180 --> 03:19:46,700
Whoa, there's...

2418
03:19:46,700 --> 03:19:48,940
You take forever to shoot for how...

2419
03:19:50,060 --> 03:19:50,540
Please.

2420
03:19:54,060 --> 03:19:58,540
Nope, you do not need to start destroying the natural rock foundation.

2421
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:02,380
As fine as it is.

2422
03:20:03,340 --> 03:20:04,620
Here's the next.

2423
03:20:05,660 --> 03:20:06,620
That's a barrier.

2424
03:20:09,500 --> 03:20:10,860
I complete this game all day.

2425
03:20:13,340 --> 03:20:15,580
Has everything just got more HP all of a sudden?

2426
03:20:15,580 --> 03:20:17,420
Oh, wait. Oh, it's just a cougar.

2427
03:20:19,260 --> 03:20:22,700
Uh, I'm scared.

2428
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:25,740
I don't like the lack of mobility.

2429
03:20:28,540 --> 03:20:30,860
I'm talking about... Where is it? Oh, it's down there.

2430
03:20:30,860 --> 03:20:32,380
Okay, he's in the lava? Hello?

2431
03:20:32,380 --> 03:20:33,260
Are you hurting yourself?

2432
03:20:35,260 --> 03:20:37,420
Oh, make it rain hell.

2433
03:20:38,220 --> 03:20:39,980
Oh, please.

2434
03:20:41,100 --> 03:20:44,860
Okay, I'm completely comprehend why the Atlas was my dad's favorite mate.

2435
03:20:44,860 --> 03:20:46,300
Because, oh my goodness.

2436
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:49,100
Literally make it rain.

2437
03:20:51,100 --> 03:20:51,600
Yeah.

2438
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:54,940
Oh, gosh.

2439
03:20:56,620 --> 03:20:57,420
Oh, hold on.

2440
03:20:58,380 --> 03:20:59,260
What's this one?

2441
03:21:01,580 --> 03:21:04,140
Oh, wow. That's actually really overpowered as well.

2442
03:21:04,140 --> 03:21:06,460
Is there any health pack for troops during this one?

2443
03:21:07,180 --> 03:21:09,740
You look like... Yeah, we got it.

2444
03:21:10,940 --> 03:21:14,540
Lack of mobility makes up for the HP, the armor,

2445
03:21:14,540 --> 03:21:17,020
and then the four death rays attached.

2446
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:17,980
Also, real guns.

2447
03:21:19,100 --> 03:21:20,300
Yes, I quite agree.

2448
03:21:20,300 --> 03:21:21,180
Wait, am I going down there?

2449
03:21:23,180 --> 03:21:25,740
I came from there.

2450
03:21:27,260 --> 03:21:28,700
Yeah, question mark.

2451
03:21:29,100 --> 03:21:34,220
Was this the one that got him all the wins on multiplayer?

2452
03:21:34,220 --> 03:21:34,620
Yeah.

2453
03:21:35,180 --> 03:21:35,740
Wait, I must be...

2454
03:21:37,420 --> 03:21:39,100
I didn't say I must be supposed to go through the lava,

2455
03:21:39,100 --> 03:21:40,140
but I didn't see it, right?

2456
03:21:43,180 --> 03:21:43,580
Right.

2457
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:45,820
Oh, I see it.

2458
03:21:46,620 --> 03:21:47,900
Can I get it before it gets me?

2459
03:21:49,420 --> 03:21:50,140
I can.

2460
03:21:50,140 --> 03:21:50,700
You too?

2461
03:21:53,100 --> 03:21:56,860
Oh, it's so nice being able to reach the enemy before the enemy gets you.

2462
03:21:57,820 --> 03:21:58,460
Oh, shit.

2463
03:21:59,580 --> 03:22:00,940
See something in the distance?

2464
03:22:00,940 --> 03:22:01,900
It's very blurry.

2465
03:22:01,900 --> 03:22:03,420
I don't know how blurry it is for you, but...

2466
03:22:04,700 --> 03:22:05,500
The mech just...

2467
03:22:06,220 --> 03:22:06,780
The mech.

2468
03:22:06,780 --> 03:22:08,060
The enemy just like...

2469
03:22:08,060 --> 03:22:08,380
Whoa.

2470
03:22:09,100 --> 03:22:09,740
Look at that.

2471
03:22:09,740 --> 03:22:10,380
That's so nice.

2472
03:22:12,940 --> 03:22:14,380
Right. Hold on.

2473
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:17,100
Okay, let's go.

2474
03:22:17,100 --> 03:22:17,740
Mech time.

2475
03:22:17,740 --> 03:22:23,180
Who are we against in this lovely enemy?

2476
03:22:23,980 --> 03:22:29,180
I think because of his health being so low,

2477
03:22:29,180 --> 03:22:30,780
we're just gonna blow this guy down.

2478
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:32,940
Easy, easy.

2479
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:35,740
And actually, we could probably drop the bridge on him.

2480
03:22:35,740 --> 03:22:36,300
You know that?

2481
03:22:37,420 --> 03:22:39,980
Oh, I want his health outside the lava though.

2482
03:22:39,980 --> 03:22:40,940
Yeah, there we go.

2483
03:22:40,940 --> 03:22:42,060
No, don't go in the lava.

2484
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:43,100
Sugar.

2485
03:22:43,820 --> 03:22:45,020
He fell back and...

2486
03:22:45,020 --> 03:22:47,500
Well, it's not like we need a major HP.

2487
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:47,820
I don't know.

2488
03:22:47,820 --> 03:22:50,060
Maybe we can touch it gently.

2489
03:22:50,060 --> 03:22:50,540
Easy.

2490
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:52,140
Just tip two.

2491
03:22:52,220 --> 03:22:53,260
Hey, we go.

2492
03:22:54,700 --> 03:22:55,260
Right, we're dead.

2493
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:02,060
I'm gonna break the bridge so the lava isn't a problem.

2494
03:23:02,060 --> 03:23:03,660
Because I don't want to lose health the lava.

2495
03:23:06,860 --> 03:23:07,500
I can't...

2496
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:08,460
I see nothing.

2497
03:23:08,460 --> 03:23:11,340
Yeah, it's a very cloudy game.

2498
03:23:12,220 --> 03:23:12,460
I...

2499
03:23:13,340 --> 03:23:14,300
I guess we did.

2500
03:23:14,300 --> 03:23:15,500
It's kinda a bit cloudy.

2501
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:16,380
Is this not gonna break?

2502
03:23:16,380 --> 03:23:16,940
Can you break it?

2503
03:23:19,580 --> 03:23:21,020
Lasers will break it faster.

2504
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:22,380
I'm gonna hold it off for the mech.

2505
03:23:24,220 --> 03:23:24,700
I assume...

2506
03:23:26,140 --> 03:23:28,140
Well, I assumed completely wrong.

2507
03:23:28,780 --> 03:23:31,100
I am actually gonna have to walk in the lava a little bit.

2508
03:23:33,020 --> 03:23:33,900
Oh wait, no, no.

2509
03:23:33,900 --> 03:23:35,180
Oh, wow.

2510
03:23:35,180 --> 03:23:35,420
Okay.

2511
03:23:36,780 --> 03:23:39,180
I just love making things harder for myself,

2512
03:23:39,180 --> 03:23:42,380
clearly, because spending the time to do that

2513
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:45,260
only to yield absolutely nothing is pretty good.

2514
03:23:45,260 --> 03:23:45,900
That's not good enough.

2515
03:23:47,020 --> 03:23:49,020
Right, I've been given special services.

2516
03:23:51,180 --> 03:23:51,980
Partygoers?

2517
03:23:51,980 --> 03:23:52,300
Where?

2518
03:23:53,340 --> 03:23:53,820
Oh, here.

2519
03:23:56,220 --> 03:23:57,020
Uh...

2520
03:23:57,020 --> 03:23:57,580
In here?

2521
03:23:58,860 --> 03:23:59,660
Whoa!

2522
03:23:59,660 --> 03:24:01,980
That's the lava in me that came out of nowhere.

2523
03:24:02,620 --> 03:24:03,420
Are you these guys?

2524
03:24:03,420 --> 03:24:03,820
One...

2525
03:24:03,820 --> 03:24:05,180
Oh, there's a mech on the battlefield.

2526
03:24:05,180 --> 03:24:05,740
Hold on.

2527
03:24:05,740 --> 03:24:06,300
Mech first.

2528
03:24:07,500 --> 03:24:08,140
Oh, hold on.

2529
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:09,260
Two!

2530
03:24:10,060 --> 03:24:10,540
Atlas!

2531
03:24:13,900 --> 03:24:15,340
Is that an Atlas or a Magiskun?

2532
03:24:15,340 --> 03:24:16,060
Scoot's Freddy.

2533
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:17,500
Okay.

2534
03:24:20,700 --> 03:24:21,420
Is that an Atlas?

2535
03:24:22,620 --> 03:24:22,940
No.

2536
03:24:22,940 --> 03:24:24,060
It's just tangible.

2537
03:24:24,060 --> 03:24:25,420
No, it is an Atlas!

2538
03:24:25,420 --> 03:24:26,620
Oh, dear.

2539
03:24:26,620 --> 03:24:27,180
Oh, dear.

2540
03:24:29,980 --> 03:24:30,860
Oh, dear.

2541
03:24:30,860 --> 03:24:31,580
Oh, dear.

2542
03:24:31,580 --> 03:24:32,780
Little Atlas moment.

2543
03:24:32,780 --> 03:24:33,260
Tee hee.

2544
03:24:33,980 --> 03:24:34,220
Great.

2545
03:24:34,220 --> 03:24:35,020
So what do I need to do?

2546
03:24:35,020 --> 03:24:36,300
Take my one by one,

2547
03:24:36,300 --> 03:24:38,620
and then just hook up all their insides.

2548
03:24:40,460 --> 03:24:41,180
And then your neck.

2549
03:24:42,780 --> 03:24:43,180
Wah.

2550
03:24:44,780 --> 03:24:45,500
Wah.

2551
03:24:45,500 --> 03:24:46,300
Not good, not good.

2552
03:24:46,300 --> 03:24:47,420
I can't see nothing bumping.

2553
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:48,380
Pick it up, whatever it is.

2554
03:24:49,100 --> 03:24:51,580
Okay, we're just gonna do this on the Atlas.

2555
03:24:52,540 --> 03:24:53,420
It's the best we've all.

2556
03:24:53,420 --> 03:24:54,620
Right, Atlas down first.

2557
03:24:54,620 --> 03:24:55,020
Hold on.

2558
03:24:55,820 --> 03:24:56,860
Is he smoking yet?

2559
03:24:58,220 --> 03:25:00,540
I'd rather you smoke first than me, buddy.

2560
03:25:00,540 --> 03:25:01,180
To be honest.

2561
03:25:01,900 --> 03:25:03,100
Nah, let's rubbish that.

2562
03:25:04,620 --> 03:25:05,340
Right.

2563
03:25:05,340 --> 03:25:05,820
See you!

2564
03:25:06,940 --> 03:25:07,660
Oh, sugar.

2565
03:25:07,660 --> 03:25:08,700
I'm low health.

2566
03:25:08,700 --> 03:25:09,980
Not good, not good, not good.

2567
03:25:10,860 --> 03:25:12,940
Oh, it would suck if I had to restart.

2568
03:25:12,940 --> 03:25:14,060
Come on, one big chug!

2569
03:25:14,060 --> 03:25:15,340
One big chug on him!

2570
03:25:15,420 --> 03:25:17,100
No, stop flying, mate, stop flying.

2571
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:18,540
Give me your health, give me your health.

2572
03:25:18,540 --> 03:25:19,740
Give me your health, give me your health.

2573
03:25:19,740 --> 03:25:20,300
Oh, right.

2574
03:25:20,300 --> 03:25:21,340
Give me your health then,

2575
03:25:21,340 --> 03:25:22,460
if you're gonna go down first.

2576
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:23,820
Please!

2577
03:25:24,380 --> 03:25:25,500
I'm on my knees!

2578
03:25:27,580 --> 03:25:28,220
Oh, sugar.

2579
03:25:28,220 --> 03:25:30,220
I have to literally walk into this guy's bullet.

2580
03:25:31,100 --> 03:25:33,180
Oh, that was so lucky I managed to cut that health.

2581
03:25:33,180 --> 03:25:33,820
Holy crap.

2582
03:25:35,660 --> 03:25:36,060
Wah.

2583
03:25:37,740 --> 03:25:39,980
Wah, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

2584
03:25:39,980 --> 03:25:41,020
Sorry, it's not luck at all.

2585
03:25:41,020 --> 03:25:42,700
It's skills, complete and utter skills.

2586
03:25:43,660 --> 03:25:46,700
I'm the daughter of a meccosalt prodigy.

2587
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:48,780
I will not have anything else.

2588
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:51,180
Right, I'm gonna look for any green buildings

2589
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:55,740
through the absolutely smoky haze that is this game.

2590
03:25:55,740 --> 03:25:57,100
Holy, holey moley.

2591
03:25:57,100 --> 03:25:58,620
I cannot see for the life of me.

2592
03:26:00,620 --> 03:26:02,140
Any green at all.

2593
03:26:02,140 --> 03:26:03,900
Like, seriously, any green at all.

2594
03:26:03,900 --> 03:26:07,980
Or any hidden green, no.

2595
03:26:07,980 --> 03:26:08,460
Am I okay?

2596
03:26:09,180 --> 03:26:09,980
That was worth it.

2597
03:26:09,980 --> 03:26:13,740
What is that off the head?

2598
03:26:16,380 --> 03:26:16,860
What is?

2599
03:26:19,980 --> 03:26:21,900
Oh, I upset something.

2600
03:26:21,900 --> 03:26:23,020
Hold on, how do I get around?

2601
03:26:25,180 --> 03:26:26,620
Just firing, I'm just firing.

2602
03:26:26,620 --> 03:26:27,900
How do I get around?

2603
03:26:28,780 --> 03:26:29,580
Is there no around?

2604
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:30,460
Is there only through?

2605
03:26:31,660 --> 03:26:35,020
Sorry, my mobility's so slow that I'm trying to...

2606
03:26:35,020 --> 03:26:36,540
Oh god, this looks like the path though.

2607
03:26:36,540 --> 03:26:38,300
Oh, dumb ass, there's a path right there.

2608
03:26:39,260 --> 03:26:41,340
I hope that there's something that's able to shoot me.

2609
03:26:41,340 --> 03:26:45,180
Yeah, lucky shot, not lucky shot at all.

2610
03:26:46,300 --> 03:26:49,420
As, eh, right, hold on.

2611
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:50,780
And then there's one over there.

2612
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:51,740
Can I see it?

2613
03:26:51,740 --> 03:26:53,340
Nope, but you can see me or not?

2614
03:26:55,740 --> 03:26:56,460
Nope, I missed.

2615
03:26:57,420 --> 03:26:58,860
Something blew on my HUD.

2616
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:01,020
Bottom left, top left.

2617
03:27:01,020 --> 03:27:04,460
Sorry, I'll let him bolt for health or something.

2618
03:27:05,260 --> 03:27:08,380
Destroy this.

2619
03:27:10,540 --> 03:27:11,500
I'd rather...

2620
03:27:11,500 --> 03:27:13,260
Oh, I want to save my other ammo.

2621
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:15,100
Whoa, it makes the team out.

2622
03:27:15,100 --> 03:27:15,740
I can't see him.

2623
03:27:17,980 --> 03:27:20,060
Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2624
03:27:20,060 --> 03:27:22,780
I can moan down, I can moan down, I can moan down, it's fine.

2625
03:27:23,740 --> 03:27:24,620
Oh god, he's got...

2626
03:27:25,740 --> 03:27:27,420
I'm overheating like hell on there.

2627
03:27:28,780 --> 03:27:30,540
Hold on, mate, can you just pause the fight?

2628
03:27:30,540 --> 03:27:32,460
Pause the fight, I need a heal.

2629
03:27:32,460 --> 03:27:33,020
Sorry, I need a...

2630
03:27:35,180 --> 03:27:39,660
Not good, not good, not good.

2631
03:27:39,660 --> 03:27:41,260
Oh god, he's burning though.

2632
03:27:41,260 --> 03:27:42,300
That's what I want to see.

2633
03:27:42,300 --> 03:27:43,980
That's what I want to see, not me though.

2634
03:27:46,860 --> 03:27:48,780
We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

2635
03:27:48,780 --> 03:27:49,340
We're doing it.

2636
03:27:49,980 --> 03:27:52,140
True protégé, momento.

2637
03:27:52,140 --> 03:27:53,500
Right, what's going on here?

2638
03:27:53,500 --> 03:27:55,660
Did I not successfully destroy that?

2639
03:27:57,020 --> 03:27:58,140
I don't really want to...

2640
03:28:00,540 --> 03:28:01,020
I don't want to...

2641
03:28:01,180 --> 03:28:02,300
All is quiet.

2642
03:28:02,300 --> 03:28:04,780
The Blake brass has been eighty-six years fled.

2643
03:28:04,780 --> 03:28:06,380
All combat forces have been in the way.

2644
03:28:06,380 --> 03:28:07,420
Okay, okay.

2645
03:28:09,180 --> 03:28:12,380
Wow, that's why I want to hold on to the ch-ch-ch-ch-amel

2646
03:28:12,380 --> 03:28:13,260
because it's soon.

2647
03:28:15,260 --> 03:28:18,140
Was it too much to ask that that lunatic was at the party?

2648
03:28:19,420 --> 03:28:21,900
Captain, we are en route to your current position.

2649
03:28:21,900 --> 03:28:25,180
The Major has decided to bring the Icarus down right where you are.

2650
03:28:25,180 --> 03:28:27,740
Foster, let's try not to crash this time, eh?

2651
03:28:31,980 --> 03:28:34,220
Okay, a little slo-mo, a little slo-mo.

2652
03:28:34,220 --> 03:28:34,540
Okay.

2653
03:28:36,380 --> 03:28:39,100
We've obtained information that more suspected rebels

2654
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:42,460
are being made to work in factories reinforcing the word of Blake.

2655
03:28:42,460 --> 03:28:42,860
Uh-huh.

2656
03:28:42,860 --> 03:28:44,620
We can kill two birds with one stone

2657
03:28:44,620 --> 03:28:47,180
by freeing the prisoners and destroying the factories.

2658
03:28:47,180 --> 03:28:48,860
We're going to hot-drop you in, sir.

2659
03:28:48,860 --> 03:28:50,940
Destroy local forces between you and the camp.

2660
03:28:50,940 --> 03:28:51,420
Secure escape, bro.

2661
03:28:51,420 --> 03:28:54,780
Take the camp towers out and, as always, flatten any hostile troops.

2662
03:28:56,300 --> 03:28:58,540
Okay, I'm gonna take a hydration.

2663
03:28:58,540 --> 03:29:00,140
Everyone please do hydrate.

2664
03:29:00,220 --> 03:29:04,300
Shawnee destroys your mech and takes you as a trophy ASMR win.

2665
03:29:09,260 --> 03:29:11,580
How rich do you have to be to build a mansion in a volcano?

2666
03:29:11,580 --> 03:29:14,140
I mean, why would you even want a mansion in a volcano?

2667
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:16,060
Ugh.

2668
03:29:16,060 --> 03:29:17,100
Okay, I've hydrated.

2669
03:29:18,860 --> 03:29:19,900
Uh, right, let's see.

2670
03:29:20,780 --> 03:29:21,100
Okay.

2671
03:29:22,060 --> 03:29:28,220
Well, an assault class mech, the Atlas is an offensive force rarely matched.

2672
03:29:28,300 --> 03:29:28,940
Yeah, sorry.

2673
03:29:28,940 --> 03:29:29,980
I'm picking Atlas.

2674
03:29:30,540 --> 03:29:32,140
If we're gonna get a lot of this,

2675
03:29:32,780 --> 03:29:35,500
game does a good job of making these bad guys seem bad.

2676
03:29:35,500 --> 03:29:36,700
I hope I'm not the bad guy.

2677
03:29:37,260 --> 03:29:39,340
Well, we're already on mix fight.

2678
03:29:39,340 --> 03:29:40,620
Hold on, there's a wee guy there.

2679
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:42,380
Can you all lock on him?

2680
03:29:42,380 --> 03:29:42,780
Thank you.

2681
03:29:45,820 --> 03:29:47,420
Did we chop her as well while we're at it?

2682
03:29:47,420 --> 03:29:48,140
Hold on.

2683
03:29:48,140 --> 03:29:48,380
What?

2684
03:29:48,380 --> 03:29:48,860
Nope.

2685
03:29:48,860 --> 03:29:50,060
That's not gonna attack me.

2686
03:29:50,460 --> 03:29:50,960
Okay.

2687
03:29:54,060 --> 03:29:58,460
That's currently installing mods to give me extra XP to use.

2688
03:29:58,460 --> 03:29:59,740
XP is XP, is that it?

2689
03:30:01,260 --> 03:30:03,580
Wah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2690
03:30:07,260 --> 03:30:07,820
Okay, hold on.

2691
03:30:07,820 --> 03:30:11,580
I think this might, oh wow, that shotgun blast definitely is the one.

2692
03:30:13,180 --> 03:30:16,700
Get out of the lava so I can at least scavenge your dead parts.

2693
03:30:20,300 --> 03:30:20,940
Come on.

2694
03:30:20,940 --> 03:30:21,420
Yeah.

2695
03:30:22,940 --> 03:30:25,580
Oh no, I can't pick it up.

2696
03:30:26,300 --> 03:30:27,900
It broke the magma.

2697
03:30:29,500 --> 03:30:30,620
Ah, draft.

2698
03:30:31,340 --> 03:30:32,860
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

2699
03:30:34,300 --> 03:30:35,980
Racing for racing, but it's fine.

2700
03:30:37,660 --> 03:30:38,940
Can't pick up the supply.

2701
03:30:38,940 --> 03:30:40,780
Okay, the magma breaks.

2702
03:30:40,780 --> 03:30:43,100
I assume it will break under the weight of my mix.

2703
03:30:43,100 --> 03:30:46,860
You know, all things considered, I probably weigh how many tons?

2704
03:30:47,980 --> 03:30:48,780
On ironically?

2705
03:30:50,540 --> 03:30:55,660
I don't want to waste too much of the shotgun.

2706
03:30:55,660 --> 03:30:58,220
The shotgun seems so effective against the enemies.

2707
03:30:59,580 --> 03:31:00,780
I can see you guys.

2708
03:31:00,780 --> 03:31:01,980
I can't target you.

2709
03:31:01,980 --> 03:31:04,220
I wonder why it's not enjoying the targeting as much.

2710
03:31:05,580 --> 03:31:06,080
Hmm.

2711
03:31:07,980 --> 03:31:10,860
Oh wow, that's actually a decent chunk, so I mean, hold on.

2712
03:31:12,220 --> 03:31:13,180
Stop it, stop it.

2713
03:31:13,900 --> 03:31:15,580
No, no, no, don't hide from me now.

2714
03:31:15,580 --> 03:31:16,780
You started the fight.

2715
03:31:16,780 --> 03:31:17,900
I'm gonna end it.

2716
03:31:17,900 --> 03:31:20,700
Do you understand your actions have consequences?

2717
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:21,820
You're gonna find out now.

2718
03:31:21,820 --> 03:31:22,300
Goodbye.

2719
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:24,940
And I'm here if you were following orders.

2720
03:31:24,940 --> 03:31:25,580
You're done for.

2721
03:31:25,580 --> 03:31:26,540
How much have I got?

2722
03:31:26,540 --> 03:31:28,620
Oh wait, I've got infinite bullet ammo as well.

2723
03:31:29,340 --> 03:31:30,380
But I've only got...

2724
03:31:30,380 --> 03:31:32,380
Oh wow, okay, sorry, I'm just gonna use the...

2725
03:31:33,660 --> 03:31:34,220
Who have I got?

2726
03:31:34,780 --> 03:31:37,180
Okay, let's get rid of you and then let's get started on you.

2727
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:41,500
But you'll need to come down so I can pick up your supplies, okay?

2728
03:31:45,180 --> 03:31:46,780
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

2729
03:31:46,780 --> 03:31:47,420
Okay, perfect.

2730
03:31:48,300 --> 03:31:48,860
I...

2731
03:31:48,860 --> 03:31:51,100
No, no, no, no, you're gonna...

2732
03:31:51,900 --> 03:31:53,820
Can the game kill itself in lava?

2733
03:31:55,740 --> 03:31:56,220
Hold on.

2734
03:31:57,500 --> 03:31:59,740
I need you to pick up your stuff.

2735
03:31:59,740 --> 03:32:00,620
I'm not even kidding.

2736
03:32:00,620 --> 03:32:01,820
Please, just perish.

2737
03:32:01,820 --> 03:32:03,500
Come on, please, game.

2738
03:32:04,540 --> 03:32:04,940
Wow.

2739
03:32:05,900 --> 03:32:07,980
100 tons of Atlas, I believe it.

2740
03:32:09,100 --> 03:32:10,060
How much health?

2741
03:32:12,380 --> 03:32:13,100
How much heal?

2742
03:32:13,820 --> 03:32:14,300
Like that.

2743
03:32:15,900 --> 03:32:16,380
Like that.

2744
03:32:16,380 --> 03:32:16,780
Right, yeah.

2745
03:32:16,780 --> 03:32:17,580
We're just shotgun.

2746
03:32:17,580 --> 03:32:18,220
You're totally crap.

2747
03:32:18,220 --> 03:32:19,900
The shotgun on the Atlas is something else.

2748
03:32:22,780 --> 03:32:24,620
You know, I didn't even tell my dad I'm playing this game

2749
03:32:24,620 --> 03:32:26,540
because they are probably filming after the stream

2750
03:32:26,540 --> 03:32:27,420
if it's not too late.

2751
03:32:31,980 --> 03:32:32,380
I'll be like,

2752
03:32:32,380 --> 03:32:33,020
stop!

2753
03:32:33,020 --> 03:32:33,980
I think it's an outpost.

2754
03:32:33,980 --> 03:32:35,740
You're right to the outpost comm tower.

2755
03:32:35,740 --> 03:32:36,460
Dust it.

2756
03:32:36,460 --> 03:32:37,820
It'll be kicking me off the PC

2757
03:32:37,820 --> 03:32:39,420
so you can play it, actually, when it gets here.

2758
03:32:39,420 --> 03:32:39,900
But now...

2759
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:43,900
Come on.

2760
03:32:43,900 --> 03:32:44,540
Stop it.

2761
03:32:44,540 --> 03:32:45,820
There's so many wee ones.

2762
03:32:46,620 --> 03:32:47,820
But their damage adds up.

2763
03:32:47,820 --> 03:32:49,660
Like, that's the problem with it.

2764
03:32:49,660 --> 03:32:50,380
I add up.

2765
03:32:50,380 --> 03:32:51,100
Where's that?

2766
03:32:51,100 --> 03:32:52,220
Oh, my God, I see it.

2767
03:32:52,780 --> 03:32:54,060
No, and it saw me.

2768
03:32:54,060 --> 03:32:54,540
Drap.

2769
03:32:55,900 --> 03:32:56,940
What's going on here?

2770
03:32:56,940 --> 03:32:57,820
I don't...

2771
03:32:57,820 --> 03:33:00,700
Why is there so many health stations?

2772
03:33:02,140 --> 03:33:04,620
Why is there so many health ups?

2773
03:33:05,740 --> 03:33:07,820
There are, like, six around me.

2774
03:33:07,820 --> 03:33:08,300
Hold on.

2775
03:33:08,300 --> 03:33:09,020
How many am I?

2776
03:33:09,020 --> 03:33:09,660
I don't know.

2777
03:33:09,660 --> 03:33:10,220
I don't know.

2778
03:33:10,220 --> 03:33:10,620
I don't know.

2779
03:33:10,620 --> 03:33:11,260
I don't know.

2780
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:11,980
I don't know.

2781
03:33:12,140 --> 03:33:12,860
How many am I?

2782
03:33:14,460 --> 03:33:15,260
Oh.

2783
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:16,060
That's why.

2784
03:33:16,060 --> 03:33:17,740
Because there's a new mech coming in the way.

2785
03:33:18,460 --> 03:33:19,260
Where are you?

2786
03:33:22,220 --> 03:33:23,180
I'm using my ultimate.

2787
03:33:23,180 --> 03:33:24,140
Don't worry.

2788
03:33:24,140 --> 03:33:24,460
Ow!

2789
03:33:26,460 --> 03:33:28,140
But you're not even on my side of the map.

2790
03:33:28,140 --> 03:33:28,940
Wait.

2791
03:33:28,940 --> 03:33:30,300
Who or what is shooting me?

2792
03:33:30,300 --> 03:33:31,900
There's, like, something tiny shooting me.

2793
03:33:32,700 --> 03:33:33,580
I can hear it!

2794
03:33:35,420 --> 03:33:35,660
Oh.

2795
03:33:37,740 --> 03:33:38,220
Hold on.

2796
03:33:38,780 --> 03:33:39,340
Hold on.

2797
03:33:42,460 --> 03:33:42,940
Hold on.

2798
03:33:43,740 --> 03:33:44,060
Oh, wait.

2799
03:33:44,060 --> 03:33:46,780
That doesn't do anything against the new repellent thing.

2800
03:33:46,780 --> 03:33:47,500
I wish we were there.

2801
03:33:49,580 --> 03:33:50,060
What?

2802
03:33:51,100 --> 03:33:52,060
Are we going to do it?

2803
03:33:56,620 --> 03:33:57,420
Oh, my gosh.

2804
03:33:59,420 --> 03:34:01,500
I feel like, because we've got Atlas unlocked,

2805
03:34:01,500 --> 03:34:03,900
we actually might be close to finishing the game.

2806
03:34:03,900 --> 03:34:04,620
Right.

2807
03:34:04,620 --> 03:34:05,340
You!

2808
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:06,300
Fuck off!

2809
03:34:06,300 --> 03:34:07,100
Holy crap.

2810
03:34:08,620 --> 03:34:09,100
Uh.

2811
03:34:10,220 --> 03:34:10,780
Oh, no.

2812
03:34:11,420 --> 03:34:11,980
Hold on.

2813
03:34:14,060 --> 03:34:15,820
Did I just unlock a memory?

2814
03:34:17,740 --> 03:34:18,460
Uh.

2815
03:34:19,820 --> 03:34:26,300
We may or may not be in for an absolute heck on earth fight coming up.

2816
03:34:27,340 --> 03:34:30,380
With an intense amount of enemies.

2817
03:34:30,380 --> 03:34:31,660
Do you think we can break these doors?

2818
03:34:33,900 --> 03:34:36,780
I just realized I think I remember this map,

2819
03:34:36,780 --> 03:34:38,460
and this might be the second blast.

2820
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:38,780
Oh, wait.

2821
03:34:38,780 --> 03:34:40,140
There's a control room.

2822
03:34:40,140 --> 03:34:40,620
Sorry.

2823
03:34:41,580 --> 03:34:41,980
There.

2824
03:34:43,900 --> 03:34:45,980
My dad loved playing this.

2825
03:34:45,980 --> 03:34:46,220
Is it?

2826
03:34:46,220 --> 03:34:48,380
If this is the map I think it is,

2827
03:34:48,380 --> 03:34:54,140
we're about to enter, like, an eight mech fight later on down here.

2828
03:34:55,100 --> 03:34:56,940
If this is the map I think it is,

2829
03:34:56,940 --> 03:34:59,020
we're, like, on the second last mission then,

2830
03:34:59,020 --> 03:35:01,260
because that was his favorite one.

2831
03:35:02,140 --> 03:35:03,740
I am getting nervous.

2832
03:35:04,940 --> 03:35:06,140
Have I just remembered?

2833
03:35:06,140 --> 03:35:06,380
Oh, wait.

2834
03:35:06,380 --> 03:35:07,820
There's something I'm to destroy back there.

2835
03:35:07,820 --> 03:35:08,700
My apologies.

2836
03:35:08,700 --> 03:35:09,100
Sorry.

2837
03:35:14,460 --> 03:35:15,420
Oh, no.

2838
03:35:15,420 --> 03:35:17,900
I actually think this may be the second last mission.

2839
03:35:19,820 --> 03:35:21,180
Uh.

2840
03:35:21,180 --> 03:35:21,500
Oh, wait.

2841
03:35:21,500 --> 03:35:21,660
Sorry.

2842
03:35:21,660 --> 03:35:22,620
I wasn't paying attention.

2843
03:35:23,260 --> 03:35:23,660
Sorry.

2844
03:35:24,460 --> 03:35:25,420
Oh, no.

2845
03:35:25,420 --> 03:35:26,220
I think it is.

2846
03:35:26,940 --> 03:35:27,260
No.

2847
03:35:27,260 --> 03:35:27,820
I think it is.

2848
03:35:27,820 --> 03:35:28,620
It's not sorry.

2849
03:35:28,620 --> 03:35:30,060
I think it should be done.

2850
03:35:30,780 --> 03:35:31,660
Am I even going to hit?

2851
03:35:33,020 --> 03:35:33,260
Nah.

2852
03:35:33,260 --> 03:35:34,380
It's going to go out of range, bro.

2853
03:35:36,700 --> 03:35:37,580
Oh, no.

2854
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:41,260
If this is the one I think it is,

2855
03:35:41,260 --> 03:35:43,020
this is going to be a challenge.

2856
03:35:45,660 --> 03:35:47,660
If I was my dad's favorite map,

2857
03:35:47,660 --> 03:35:49,820
so surely that means I can do it.

2858
03:35:49,820 --> 03:35:50,700
My dad's favorite map.

2859
03:35:53,180 --> 03:35:55,100
I've all the standing spirit this time.

2860
03:35:56,540 --> 03:35:56,860
Oh.

2861
03:35:57,900 --> 03:35:59,020
I'm getting ready to get.

2862
03:35:59,020 --> 03:36:00,380
So, of course, it wouldn't do that.

2863
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:01,740
Oh, no.

2864
03:36:04,860 --> 03:36:05,740
Games hate hate.

2865
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:09,900
There's a special there.

2866
03:36:11,580 --> 03:36:12,460
I think the enemy.

2867
03:36:16,060 --> 03:36:16,540
Wow.

2868
03:36:18,140 --> 03:36:19,820
You're the only one that can shoot with that.

2869
03:36:21,500 --> 03:36:22,860
Oh, another make another make.

2870
03:36:30,620 --> 03:36:34,700
Oh, that's not.

2871
03:36:34,700 --> 03:36:36,140
I keep using that again.

2872
03:36:36,140 --> 03:36:38,300
But that's actually not what I'm supposed to do.

2873
03:36:38,300 --> 03:36:41,420
See these fucking me bam over the fucking tanks.

2874
03:36:41,420 --> 03:36:41,900
Oh, my God.

2875
03:36:41,900 --> 03:36:42,940
They like come out of nowhere.

2876
03:36:42,940 --> 03:36:44,380
And look at the situation.

2877
03:36:44,380 --> 03:36:45,180
Like I can't even.

2878
03:36:45,900 --> 03:36:49,500
I cannot avoid these attacks unless I get lucky like that.

2879
03:36:55,260 --> 03:36:55,500
Sorry.

2880
03:36:55,500 --> 03:36:56,380
I'm just using shotgun.

2881
03:36:57,900 --> 03:36:59,180
You know, don't hit me.

2882
03:36:59,180 --> 03:36:59,740
Don't hit me.

2883
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:00,460
That's so rude.

2884
03:37:00,460 --> 03:37:02,140
Honestly, it is right there.

2885
03:37:05,820 --> 03:37:07,740
Members a smart sooner than expected.

2886
03:37:07,740 --> 03:37:13,260
I mean, if we do it, then yeah, I'll take a cup of tea.

2887
03:37:13,260 --> 03:37:14,780
I'll get some food, actually.

2888
03:37:14,780 --> 03:37:15,500
Because I don't want to eat.

2889
03:37:20,060 --> 03:37:22,060
We got him with their panty loons down.

2890
03:37:22,060 --> 03:37:22,700
That's right.

2891
03:37:25,340 --> 03:37:26,620
Getting that lava.

2892
03:37:26,620 --> 03:37:28,540
I think they can hurt themselves in the lava.

2893
03:37:29,980 --> 03:37:32,780
Unless it's only me because I'm classic video game.

2894
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:35,580
Oh, that's okay.

2895
03:37:35,580 --> 03:37:36,060
There we go.

2896
03:37:42,780 --> 03:37:45,580
Well, the good news is you're super close to me.

2897
03:37:48,220 --> 03:37:50,460
The bad news is I'm overheating like no one's.

2898
03:37:51,500 --> 03:37:53,420
Oh, they might actually get me.

2899
03:37:53,420 --> 03:37:55,180
But sorry, I need to play safe.

2900
03:37:56,300 --> 03:37:57,100
Oh, for goodness sake.

2901
03:37:57,100 --> 03:38:00,460
He gets so close that I'm like getting cut cut.

2902
03:38:02,140 --> 03:38:04,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2903
03:38:06,860 --> 03:38:07,420
Come on.

2904
03:38:07,420 --> 03:38:08,300
Get that one first.

2905
03:38:08,300 --> 03:38:09,420
Oh, maybe a double kill.

2906
03:38:12,940 --> 03:38:15,500
He got damaged so much from that mech blowing up.

2907
03:38:15,500 --> 03:38:16,300
Feels good, man.

2908
03:38:17,420 --> 03:38:18,380
Feels good, man.

2909
03:38:18,380 --> 03:38:19,580
Feels good, man.

2910
03:38:19,580 --> 03:38:21,020
He got damaged so much.

2911
03:38:23,180 --> 03:38:23,660
Okay.

2912
03:38:24,620 --> 03:38:26,300
Much mutual happy.

2913
03:38:26,300 --> 03:38:28,380
Mutual happy with how that occurred.

2914
03:38:28,380 --> 03:38:29,580
That came out so well.

2915
03:38:30,380 --> 03:38:31,020
Oh, okay.

2916
03:38:31,020 --> 03:38:31,340
Okay.

2917
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:31,820
Okay.

2918
03:38:31,820 --> 03:38:32,300
You ready?

2919
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:32,700
You ready?

2920
03:38:38,060 --> 03:38:38,300
How?

2921
03:38:41,340 --> 03:38:43,100
No, you're getting sprayed, bro.

2922
03:38:43,100 --> 03:38:44,700
You're getting sprayed just because of the...

2923
03:38:47,020 --> 03:38:47,420
Okay.

2924
03:38:48,540 --> 03:38:50,460
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2925
03:38:51,740 --> 03:38:52,700
Good work.

2926
03:38:52,700 --> 03:38:54,060
Let's free those villains.

2927
03:38:54,060 --> 03:38:56,060
Get out of here and find Ragnarok.

2928
03:38:56,300 --> 03:38:57,420
Calm down with you.

2929
03:38:57,420 --> 03:38:58,540
Marked and on radar.

2930
03:39:00,540 --> 03:39:00,860
Okay.

2931
03:39:02,140 --> 03:39:03,820
I think we're doing a good job.

2932
03:39:07,980 --> 03:39:08,300
Wow.

2933
03:39:09,580 --> 03:39:10,780
Good job, man.

2934
03:39:11,900 --> 03:39:17,260
That's always very satisfying getting a double whammy like that.

2935
03:39:17,260 --> 03:39:17,580
Right.

2936
03:39:17,580 --> 03:39:20,460
I'm like getting full up on like all this special stuff.

2937
03:39:21,180 --> 03:39:21,580
Right.

2938
03:39:21,580 --> 03:39:22,780
Full health.

2939
03:39:22,780 --> 03:39:23,900
I'm full on everything.

2940
03:39:24,860 --> 03:39:25,980
You know, I'm not until...

2941
03:39:25,980 --> 03:39:27,340
Wait, I need that one.

2942
03:39:31,820 --> 03:39:32,300
Hold on.

2943
03:39:33,580 --> 03:39:33,900
Sorry.

2944
03:39:33,900 --> 03:39:36,220
A little bit bigger than I anticipated.

2945
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:43,580
It's too easy for such a gamer pro like me, honestly.

2946
03:39:43,580 --> 03:39:45,020
You can't, you can't hand...

2947
03:39:45,020 --> 03:39:46,620
Oh, I'm full on that.

2948
03:39:46,620 --> 03:39:48,300
Oh, that's the ammo type.

2949
03:39:48,300 --> 03:39:48,940
Sorry.

2950
03:39:48,940 --> 03:39:49,660
Is it this one?

2951
03:39:50,540 --> 03:39:51,580
Am I being a dum-dum?

2952
03:39:52,140 --> 03:40:00,540
Okay, I re-stocked eight more bullets, but that's okay.

2953
03:40:02,140 --> 03:40:03,340
It's the energy coil.

2954
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:04,300
Is that why they're called?

2955
03:40:05,420 --> 03:40:07,180
Because you guys are such a nerd.

2956
03:40:08,380 --> 03:40:09,340
Oh, sorry.

2957
03:40:09,340 --> 03:40:10,060
This is the one.

2958
03:40:11,580 --> 03:40:12,300
Whoa.

2959
03:40:12,300 --> 03:40:13,260
You survived that?

2960
03:40:13,820 --> 03:40:14,540
I'm surprised.

2961
03:40:16,300 --> 03:40:18,060
Pleasantly surprised.

2962
03:40:18,060 --> 03:40:19,660
Not particularly surprised.

2963
03:40:22,140 --> 03:40:23,020
Wow, I wish that...

2964
03:40:26,700 --> 03:40:28,060
So this is the map I think is.

2965
03:40:28,060 --> 03:40:29,740
I'm nervous for what's up ahead,

2966
03:40:30,300 --> 03:40:32,220
but if it's my dad's favorite map,

2967
03:40:32,220 --> 03:40:34,460
then truly it can't be that bad, right?

2968
03:40:35,340 --> 03:40:37,900
Even though my dad was like pretty much number one on this game.

2969
03:40:37,900 --> 03:40:39,100
Incoming bombers.

2970
03:40:39,100 --> 03:40:39,820
Watch yourself.

2971
03:40:43,900 --> 03:40:44,860
What do they do?

2972
03:40:44,860 --> 03:40:46,780
Oh my god, they're literally fucking...

2973
03:40:46,780 --> 03:40:48,060
What, are they B-52s?

2974
03:40:48,620 --> 03:40:49,340
Jeez.

2975
03:40:49,340 --> 03:40:50,940
You coming back for more or not?

2976
03:40:52,540 --> 03:40:54,300
I hear a chopper now.

2977
03:40:57,340 --> 03:40:58,140
You're a chopper.

2978
03:40:59,100 --> 03:41:00,460
I don't like it.

2979
03:41:00,460 --> 03:41:02,300
I'm gonna do some of these from afar,

2980
03:41:02,300 --> 03:41:04,700
because there's a lot of noise ahead.

2981
03:41:06,300 --> 03:41:07,900
I don't think I'm gonna be doing myself

2982
03:41:07,900 --> 03:41:09,260
any favors just running in.

2983
03:41:11,660 --> 03:41:13,580
I'm gonna break that just in case.

2984
03:41:13,580 --> 03:41:14,380
I'll break this.

2985
03:41:14,380 --> 03:41:15,020
That's fine.

2986
03:41:15,580 --> 03:41:16,140
You're fine.

2987
03:41:16,540 --> 03:41:23,020
I think those are what communicate the hail attack.

2988
03:41:23,020 --> 03:41:24,140
I'm gonna try that.

2989
03:41:26,860 --> 03:41:28,140
Oh wow, hold on.

2990
03:41:29,500 --> 03:41:31,100
Man, I can't destroy everything all at once.

2991
03:41:31,100 --> 03:41:32,300
Give me a second.

2992
03:41:32,300 --> 03:41:33,100
Give me a second.

2993
03:41:34,380 --> 03:41:34,940
Something.

2994
03:41:35,820 --> 03:41:37,580
I think I just hurt myself by accident.

2995
03:41:38,460 --> 03:41:39,260
I'm gonna build in.

2996
03:41:39,260 --> 03:41:39,660
Drat.

2997
03:41:40,940 --> 03:41:41,660
Drat, drat, drat.

2998
03:41:41,660 --> 03:41:42,780
That wasn't part of the plan.

2999
03:41:45,100 --> 03:41:45,580
Oh.

3000
03:41:46,380 --> 03:41:47,660
That hurt infantry.

3001
03:41:48,300 --> 03:41:49,340
Imagine being like, oh yeah,

3002
03:41:49,340 --> 03:41:51,340
by the way, your job is to go against an atlas.

3003
03:41:51,340 --> 03:41:51,980
An atlas?

3004
03:41:51,980 --> 03:41:53,500
Call me a deserter.

3005
03:41:53,500 --> 03:41:55,180
Freaking call me, I don't know.

3006
03:41:55,180 --> 03:41:57,500
What's the type of deserter?

3007
03:41:57,500 --> 03:41:57,820
Call me...

3008
03:42:00,140 --> 03:42:02,220
Wait, why can't I think of one deserter right now?

3009
03:42:04,380 --> 03:42:05,900
Call me chocolate pudding,

3010
03:42:05,900 --> 03:42:07,340
because I'm a deserter.

3011
03:42:07,340 --> 03:42:07,980
Get me out of here.

3012
03:42:08,780 --> 03:42:09,900
Sorry, that took me so long.

3013
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:14,620
I don't know why that was so hard.

3014
03:42:15,740 --> 03:42:17,820
Watch out for what?

3015
03:42:17,820 --> 03:42:19,020
Oh, great.

3016
03:42:19,020 --> 03:42:21,020
I assume there's something special in here.

3017
03:42:22,540 --> 03:42:23,900
If it was behind a wee paywall,

3018
03:42:23,900 --> 03:42:26,380
I'd say that as if it wasn't just literally one thing.

3019
03:42:28,300 --> 03:42:29,500
A strawberry flan.

3020
03:42:29,500 --> 03:42:30,300
Ice cream.

3021
03:42:30,300 --> 03:42:31,020
A flan?

3022
03:42:31,020 --> 03:42:31,420
What's that?

3023
03:42:31,420 --> 03:42:32,380
A flan?

3024
03:42:32,380 --> 03:42:33,260
Pancake or this?

3025
03:42:34,140 --> 03:42:34,940
Oh, sorry, I missed.

3026
03:42:41,340 --> 03:42:42,460
Yeah, that's what you wrote me.

3027
03:42:43,180 --> 03:42:44,620
Imagine surviving that back.

3028
03:42:44,860 --> 03:42:45,340
Cute.

3029
03:42:47,260 --> 03:42:47,820
Yeah, sorry.

3030
03:42:47,820 --> 03:42:49,900
I'm going to take every heal I get,

3031
03:42:49,900 --> 03:42:52,060
because I do not have enough health.

3032
03:42:52,060 --> 03:42:52,300
Ow.

3033
03:42:53,820 --> 03:42:55,100
Are you a deserter?

3034
03:42:55,100 --> 03:42:56,860
Because I terrimis-

3035
03:42:56,860 --> 03:42:57,900
terrimis-

3036
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:58,540
you!

3037
03:42:58,540 --> 03:42:59,020
Hold on.

3038
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:00,620
Oh.

3039
03:43:06,060 --> 03:43:07,180
I wonder if that does damage

3040
03:43:07,180 --> 03:43:08,300
if it hits me on the way down.

3041
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:12,300
For goodness sake.

3042
03:43:15,580 --> 03:43:18,540
These tanks are absolutely calling me.

3043
03:43:19,820 --> 03:43:21,340
Bro, I can't even avoid them.

3044
03:43:22,380 --> 03:43:23,260
Is that geyser?

3045
03:43:23,260 --> 03:43:25,180
Is that water geyser to cool me down?

3046
03:43:26,380 --> 03:43:27,660
I'm not sure how much I cost it.

3047
03:43:27,660 --> 03:43:28,620
I don't want to stand on it

3048
03:43:28,620 --> 03:43:30,460
in case it's just a steam cloud.

3049
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:33,820
I don't know.

3050
03:43:33,820 --> 03:43:35,020
You seem like water to me.

3051
03:43:35,900 --> 03:43:36,380
Oh, my God.

3052
03:43:36,380 --> 03:43:37,260
Sorry, I'm going to have to swap.

3053
03:43:37,260 --> 03:43:40,860
These guys are not taking the shotgun shells very well.

3054
03:43:45,580 --> 03:43:46,460
That's what I'm talking about.

3055
03:43:48,220 --> 03:43:48,620
Crap.

3056
03:43:49,580 --> 03:43:51,500
I'm taking some HP damage.

3057
03:43:52,540 --> 03:43:53,500
I don't think the game-

3058
03:43:54,140 --> 03:43:55,660
maybe the game does let you go all the way back

3059
03:43:55,660 --> 03:43:57,100
because your instant's in the map.

3060
03:43:57,100 --> 03:43:59,500
Like, it's one big map that's been unlocked.

3061
03:44:02,940 --> 03:44:04,620
Sir, to clear the way for the prisoners,

3062
03:44:04,620 --> 03:44:06,300
the turrets ahead need to be destroyed.

3063
03:44:06,300 --> 03:44:06,860
Yes, sir.

3064
03:44:06,860 --> 03:44:08,940
I've seen so many fixed defenses in one place.

3065
03:44:08,940 --> 03:44:10,140
Are they pointed the wrong way?

3066
03:44:11,660 --> 03:44:13,740
I don't know if they're fighting the wrong way.

3067
03:44:13,820 --> 03:44:15,340
They're seemingly pointed at me.

3068
03:44:17,660 --> 03:44:18,700
Oh, I can see it.

3069
03:44:19,740 --> 03:44:20,860
Okay, we got it.

3070
03:44:20,860 --> 03:44:21,660
Feels good, man.

3071
03:44:21,660 --> 03:44:22,460
Okay, there's a health.

3072
03:44:28,700 --> 03:44:29,740
Okay, I think I can see-

3073
03:44:29,740 --> 03:44:31,900
I was going to say I'm pretty sure that can see me.

3074
03:44:31,900 --> 03:44:32,380
Oh, no.

3075
03:44:33,740 --> 03:44:34,380
Thank you.

3076
03:44:34,380 --> 03:44:35,660
And another one.

3077
03:44:35,660 --> 03:44:36,300
Thank you.

3078
03:44:38,780 --> 03:44:40,700
Mech warrior, you should be able to see the camp

3079
03:44:40,700 --> 03:44:41,500
from where you are.

3080
03:44:41,500 --> 03:44:41,900
Yeah?

3081
03:44:41,900 --> 03:44:43,420
Sir, looks like a very light,

3082
03:44:44,220 --> 03:44:44,940
should be cake.

3083
03:44:46,540 --> 03:44:49,340
No, that is bait, if I've ever seen it.

3084
03:44:51,660 --> 03:44:53,500
I do not trust that at all.

3085
03:44:53,500 --> 03:44:55,100
There is one more thing over there.

3086
03:44:57,340 --> 03:44:59,500
Yep, there's another, another thing over there.

3087
03:44:59,500 --> 03:45:00,860
Wait, so what's that supposed to-

3088
03:45:02,220 --> 03:45:02,860
I can like-

3089
03:45:03,820 --> 03:45:05,980
Am I supposed to go all the way in a circle?

3090
03:45:05,980 --> 03:45:06,700
Like, around?

3091
03:45:09,660 --> 03:45:10,780
Please don't worry if you're-

3092
03:45:10,780 --> 03:45:12,380
Like, I cannot see what you're shooting at.

3093
03:45:12,380 --> 03:45:14,220
I promise you, I can hardly see either.

3094
03:45:14,220 --> 03:45:15,580
The crosshair is going red,

3095
03:45:15,580 --> 03:45:17,580
which means the AI is locked on,

3096
03:45:17,580 --> 03:45:18,380
so I'm just-

3097
03:45:19,340 --> 03:45:22,220
I am just taking it as it comey come comes.

3098
03:45:23,100 --> 03:45:24,780
Yeah, it's literally a trap.

3099
03:45:24,780 --> 03:45:25,420
I'm sorry, but-

3100
03:45:26,300 --> 03:45:27,740
There's only a light thing.

3101
03:45:27,740 --> 03:45:28,780
Yeah, I don't believe it.

3102
03:45:32,380 --> 03:45:34,220
Oh, I thought I should be able-

3103
03:45:39,180 --> 03:45:40,780
Take it easy, easy.

3104
03:45:42,620 --> 03:45:43,100
I'm even-

3105
03:45:45,580 --> 03:45:46,220
Yeah.

3106
03:45:46,220 --> 03:45:47,340
Okay, we made it down.

3107
03:45:49,020 --> 03:45:50,860
Nice and safe, nice and friendly.

3108
03:45:50,860 --> 03:45:52,540
There's no more turrets coming at us.

3109
03:45:53,900 --> 03:45:55,660
Um, we'll maybe take a few-

3110
03:45:55,660 --> 03:45:57,180
Oh, of course.

3111
03:45:57,180 --> 03:45:59,900
Oh, of course the HUD was telling us the truth.

3112
03:45:59,900 --> 03:46:02,060
Open the gates and defend the civilians.

3113
03:46:02,060 --> 03:46:02,620
Oh, yes.

3114
03:46:05,180 --> 03:46:06,460
I look very much like you.

3115
03:46:10,060 --> 03:46:11,900
I'm to defend civilians.

3116
03:46:12,860 --> 03:46:14,460
Why did that give me three?

3117
03:46:16,060 --> 03:46:16,540
Fuck.

3118
03:46:18,140 --> 03:46:19,420
Why did that give me three?

3119
03:46:24,460 --> 03:46:24,960
Oh.

3120
03:46:26,460 --> 03:46:26,960
Oh.

3121
03:46:35,180 --> 03:46:36,460
Atlas, okay.

3122
03:46:36,460 --> 03:46:37,500
Okay, where?

3123
03:46:37,500 --> 03:46:37,980
Where?

3124
03:46:37,980 --> 03:46:38,300
Where?

3125
03:46:38,300 --> 03:46:39,900
Right side, right side, right side on the HUD.

3126
03:46:40,860 --> 03:46:42,860
Scream down, scream down.

3127
03:46:42,860 --> 03:46:44,140
I have heavy ammo.

3128
03:46:49,180 --> 03:46:50,620
It's fine, it's fine.

3129
03:46:50,620 --> 03:46:54,060
We are over-keying, but we're just going to keep on at it.

3130
03:46:55,740 --> 03:46:57,100
Okay, we're just going to keep on at it.

3131
03:46:58,300 --> 03:47:00,300
Why is that Atlas got special moveset?

3132
03:47:02,780 --> 03:47:03,740
Okay, okay.

3133
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:05,820
Cool down.

3134
03:47:07,100 --> 03:47:07,740
Cool down.

3135
03:47:07,740 --> 03:47:08,220
Let this-

3136
03:47:08,220 --> 03:47:09,500
Let this Atlas cool down.

3137
03:47:10,460 --> 03:47:11,340
We're going to go next.

3138
03:47:12,060 --> 03:47:13,020
We're going to pick up the health.

3139
03:47:13,020 --> 03:47:14,060
We're full health again.

3140
03:47:15,500 --> 03:47:16,780
Sir, watch yourself.

3141
03:47:16,780 --> 03:47:19,180
The drop ship's returning and it's hot-dropping another mech.

3142
03:47:20,220 --> 03:47:20,860
Uh-huh.

3143
03:47:20,860 --> 03:47:23,260
Please be another Atlas, because I can handle an Atlas.

3144
03:47:24,060 --> 03:47:27,580
I think it's a Ragnarok, considering how long this cutscene is going for.

3145
03:47:29,180 --> 03:47:29,500
No.

3146
03:47:30,140 --> 03:47:31,980
It's too Atlas-y!

3147
03:47:31,980 --> 03:47:36,620
Oh my god, when two Atlas do together, they become Atlas-y, like, uh, stuff.

3148
03:47:36,620 --> 03:47:39,100
Oh, oh lord, I do not like this.

3149
03:47:40,780 --> 03:47:42,460
And there's so many bunkers in my way.

3150
03:47:42,460 --> 03:47:44,220
Okay, that's why they gave me two health.

3151
03:47:44,220 --> 03:47:48,060
I'm going to slowly worm my way back to the two health bits,

3152
03:47:49,180 --> 03:47:50,780
as I destroy all the buildings in the way.

3153
03:47:50,780 --> 03:47:51,500
Sorry, my bad.

3154
03:47:52,140 --> 03:47:53,500
My bad, I'm just healing.

3155
03:47:53,500 --> 03:47:55,500
Okay, there are two health to my left now.

3156
03:47:55,500 --> 03:47:56,300
I feel okay.

3157
03:47:57,100 --> 03:47:59,900
I feel like we're melting this guy pretty adequately.

3158
03:47:59,900 --> 03:48:00,940
He is getting low.

3159
03:48:01,980 --> 03:48:05,180
And maybe we can get a double kill if he goes down and hurts him.

3160
03:48:05,740 --> 03:48:06,780
Oh, come on, hurt him.

3161
03:48:07,740 --> 03:48:10,300
Oh, shit, I did not need to take that one.

3162
03:48:11,020 --> 03:48:11,500
Okay.

3163
03:48:12,860 --> 03:48:15,100
Did he take any damage for that?

3164
03:48:15,100 --> 03:48:16,380
Oh, I don't think so.

3165
03:48:16,940 --> 03:48:18,620
Okay, we can't shoot each other over the wall.

3166
03:48:20,700 --> 03:48:22,620
He's, you're not shooting this.

3167
03:48:22,620 --> 03:48:23,820
Okay, now you are.

3168
03:48:23,820 --> 03:48:26,780
So, I can't shoot over the wall, but he can shoot over the wall.

3169
03:48:26,780 --> 03:48:27,740
Yeah, sounds a bit rude.

3170
03:48:28,620 --> 03:48:29,580
Have I got any extra?

3171
03:48:29,580 --> 03:48:31,260
No, I accidentally picked up both of them.

3172
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:33,260
Oh.

3173
03:48:33,660 --> 03:48:39,660
Oh, he's limping.

3174
03:48:39,660 --> 03:48:40,860
Oh, I'm gone.

3175
03:48:46,860 --> 03:48:48,140
Look at the goods, though.

3176
03:48:50,140 --> 03:48:51,660
Look at the goods, though.

3177
03:48:54,220 --> 03:48:56,940
Eh, look at the goods, though, that drop from atlases.

3178
03:48:57,900 --> 03:48:58,780
Or atlasi.

3179
03:48:59,500 --> 03:49:00,700
Any atlasi, enjoy.

3180
03:49:02,140 --> 03:49:02,700
Hey, back.

3181
03:49:03,660 --> 03:49:05,660
A high-ranking, oh, sorry.

3182
03:49:06,860 --> 03:49:07,740
Prevent escape.

3183
03:49:11,980 --> 03:49:12,940
I think we're doing it.

3184
03:49:17,500 --> 03:49:19,660
Did I win the e-mech fight without realizing?

3185
03:49:21,100 --> 03:49:24,060
When you two atlasi come together to make a baby atlas.

3186
03:49:25,020 --> 03:49:27,500
Does this count now as three or is it more like a wasting?

3187
03:49:27,500 --> 03:49:28,380
I have no idea.

3188
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:30,940
It was the repair yard.

3189
03:49:30,940 --> 03:49:32,140
We're on payback.

3190
03:49:32,220 --> 03:49:33,900
What's payback?

3191
03:49:33,900 --> 03:49:36,860
Is it like, this isn't the last mission.

3192
03:49:36,860 --> 03:49:38,860
I remember the look of the last mission.

3193
03:49:39,500 --> 03:49:41,900
Shawnee, they sat with extreme prejudice.

3194
03:49:41,900 --> 03:49:43,260
You know what you must do.

3195
03:49:47,180 --> 03:49:49,180
Random questions, you still want to hold it?

3196
03:49:49,180 --> 03:49:50,060
Naturally.

3197
03:49:50,060 --> 03:49:52,140
I can't believe that freaking got 50k views.

3198
03:49:52,140 --> 03:49:52,780
That's insane.

3199
03:49:54,380 --> 03:49:55,820
Honestly, I didn't expect that.

3200
03:49:57,020 --> 03:49:59,660
Shawnee taking on eight guys without breaking a sweat.

3201
03:49:59,660 --> 03:50:01,820
All I'm seeing is that recording booth.

3202
03:50:02,620 --> 03:50:03,980
The ASMR booth, sorry.

3203
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:09,660
Payback, a high-ranking war of battlefields.

3204
03:50:17,020 --> 03:50:19,180
And one of the vehicles in the convoy.

3205
03:50:20,540 --> 03:50:22,860
Okay, this might require a few attempts.

3206
03:50:22,860 --> 03:50:26,940
I don't recall that magma gonna break and hurt me.

3207
03:50:32,780 --> 03:50:34,460
Don't be distracted.

3208
03:50:34,460 --> 03:50:35,580
Only one thing matters.

3209
03:50:36,380 --> 03:50:37,340
Watch school for it.

3210
03:50:42,860 --> 03:50:45,020
This convoy, this entire convoy.

3211
03:50:46,140 --> 03:50:48,300
Wait, I don't have enough HP for this.

3212
03:50:50,220 --> 03:50:51,180
Am I being silly?

3213
03:50:54,620 --> 03:50:55,500
Am I being silly?

3214
03:50:55,500 --> 03:50:56,060
Am I being silly?

3215
03:50:57,340 --> 03:50:59,820
Now you can have it up to you to fly into the lava.

3216
03:50:59,820 --> 03:51:00,700
That would be great.

3217
03:51:00,780 --> 03:51:03,340
They're all in catapult heavy mags.

3218
03:51:03,340 --> 03:51:04,860
To be sure you get the second to command,

3219
03:51:04,860 --> 03:51:06,380
you'll need to knock them all out.

3220
03:51:06,380 --> 03:51:07,980
Okay, so I'm to kill them.

3221
03:51:09,740 --> 03:51:10,780
First mag down.

3222
03:51:11,900 --> 03:51:14,460
Take up his health and then spray spray.

3223
03:51:16,860 --> 03:51:17,900
Uh, sure.

3224
03:51:19,980 --> 03:51:21,260
That's not even locking on.

3225
03:51:21,900 --> 03:51:24,060
Wait, I'm getting a blary is...

3226
03:51:25,740 --> 03:51:26,380
Hold on.

3227
03:51:26,380 --> 03:51:27,820
What are the tactics for this?

3228
03:51:28,780 --> 03:51:30,060
Is there tactics?

3229
03:51:30,060 --> 03:51:31,420
Is there really healing up here?

3230
03:51:33,180 --> 03:51:33,500
Huh?

3231
03:51:36,780 --> 03:51:37,740
I basically...

3232
03:51:37,740 --> 03:51:38,540
Well, I need to...

3233
03:51:38,540 --> 03:51:39,420
Oh, wow.

3234
03:51:39,420 --> 03:51:39,980
Holy crap.

3235
03:51:39,980 --> 03:51:42,300
The AI is, like, ready to lock on.

3236
03:51:43,660 --> 03:51:44,140
Oh, dear.

3237
03:51:44,140 --> 03:51:45,500
I think we're gonna need a strategy.

3238
03:51:49,260 --> 03:51:49,580
Oh!

3239
03:51:53,420 --> 03:51:55,100
I think this might be the strategy.

3240
03:51:58,780 --> 03:52:00,300
Uh...

3241
03:52:00,300 --> 03:52:00,780
Oh, yeah.

3242
03:52:04,620 --> 03:52:04,940
Okay.

3243
03:52:06,140 --> 03:52:06,860
We've got one.

3244
03:52:08,460 --> 03:52:09,740
Oh, there's health down there.

3245
03:52:10,780 --> 03:52:12,220
I don't want to get too greedy now.

3246
03:52:13,340 --> 03:52:14,460
I can let them pass.

3247
03:52:14,460 --> 03:52:14,780
Oh!

3248
03:52:17,340 --> 03:52:18,060
Did we do it?

3249
03:52:18,940 --> 03:52:20,060
By accident?

3250
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:21,100
I think we did.

3251
03:52:21,100 --> 03:52:22,780
Okay, let's go get some health.

3252
03:52:22,780 --> 03:52:24,700
I think that would be the way to move right now

3253
03:52:24,700 --> 03:52:26,300
is to grab all these boobies.

3254
03:52:27,820 --> 03:52:29,980
Thank goodness I stopped, like, try hard on the target.

3255
03:52:29,980 --> 03:52:31,180
Right, let's catch up a bit.

3256
03:52:31,180 --> 03:52:32,220
He's a wee bit ahead.

3257
03:52:38,620 --> 03:52:40,860
Sir, the word of Blake is in full retreat.

3258
03:52:40,860 --> 03:52:43,260
Like amateurs, they've probably left something useful.

3259
03:52:43,980 --> 03:52:44,220
Yeah.

3260
03:52:45,260 --> 03:52:45,660
Oh, yeah.

3261
03:52:47,180 --> 03:52:47,660
Hold on.

3262
03:52:51,980 --> 03:52:53,180
Is this fine?

3263
03:52:53,180 --> 03:52:53,820
Yeah, okay.

3264
03:52:53,820 --> 03:52:56,220
They do not have much health against an atlas like this.

3265
03:52:57,820 --> 03:52:59,260
Bro, just accept it.

3266
03:52:59,260 --> 03:53:00,140
You're getting wrecked.

3267
03:53:02,140 --> 03:53:03,580
Oh, there's something going for me at the left.

3268
03:53:03,580 --> 03:53:04,300
I don't know what it is.

3269
03:53:04,300 --> 03:53:05,100
It's not amazing.

3270
03:53:08,860 --> 03:53:11,420
Sirs, I'm reading multiple signatures.

3271
03:53:11,420 --> 03:53:13,740
It looks like another convoy.

3272
03:53:13,740 --> 03:53:14,300
Oh.

3273
03:53:14,300 --> 03:53:16,700
Foster, when you looked at the sensors the first time,

3274
03:53:16,700 --> 03:53:19,580
you missed a group of massive walking tanks.

3275
03:53:20,860 --> 03:53:22,540
Get a move on and stop that other group.

3276
03:53:22,540 --> 03:53:24,940
I love how cheeky they are to each other.

3277
03:53:24,940 --> 03:53:27,500
You missed a group of walking tanks?

3278
03:53:27,820 --> 03:53:29,900
I mean, honestly, she's pretty justified

3279
03:53:29,900 --> 03:53:31,020
for saying it like that.

3280
03:53:31,020 --> 03:53:33,580
Like, what do you mean you missed a group?

3281
03:53:33,580 --> 03:53:34,540
One of those mechs.

3282
03:53:34,540 --> 03:53:35,340
Keep after them, sir.

3283
03:53:35,340 --> 03:53:35,580
What?

3284
03:53:35,580 --> 03:53:36,620
There's so many enemies.

3285
03:53:37,900 --> 03:53:39,500
Is there supplies up here?

3286
03:53:39,500 --> 03:53:40,060
Is that why?

3287
03:53:41,180 --> 03:53:42,620
I think there may be supplies.

3288
03:53:42,620 --> 03:53:43,420
Let's see if we can get them.

3289
03:53:46,540 --> 03:53:48,620
Oh, of course they take these pretty much.

3290
03:53:49,420 --> 03:53:51,260
They're silly of me to assume other guys.

3291
03:53:52,460 --> 03:53:53,100
Okay, boom.

3292
03:53:54,380 --> 03:53:57,020
And then let's find all the good things in here.

3293
03:53:58,780 --> 03:53:59,580
Quite a few.

3294
03:54:04,540 --> 03:54:06,460
You, actually, I don't use rockets.

3295
03:54:10,220 --> 03:54:11,340
I think we're doing it.

3296
03:54:11,340 --> 03:54:15,740
I don't want to drink it, but I think we're doing it.

3297
03:54:18,300 --> 03:54:19,580
Okay, we've got full health.

3298
03:54:21,260 --> 03:54:23,100
That's B. Your target?

3299
03:54:23,100 --> 03:54:24,220
This is tamed.

3300
03:54:24,220 --> 03:54:25,500
You stop that right now.

3301
03:54:25,500 --> 03:54:26,140
You stop that.

3302
03:54:26,140 --> 03:54:26,940
You're trolling me.

3303
03:54:27,020 --> 03:54:27,820
It's not tamed.

3304
03:54:27,820 --> 03:54:29,020
Don't say such horrible things.

3305
03:54:30,380 --> 03:54:30,700
Oh, wait.

3306
03:54:30,700 --> 03:54:32,140
It must be supposed to be up or down right now.

3307
03:54:32,140 --> 03:54:32,620
I don't know.

3308
03:54:32,620 --> 03:54:33,100
Oh, fuck it.

3309
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:33,820
It says go this way.

3310
03:54:33,820 --> 03:54:34,460
I'm going this way.

3311
03:54:35,740 --> 03:54:36,700
They're getting away.

3312
03:54:36,700 --> 03:54:37,500
Stop!

3313
03:54:37,500 --> 03:54:37,980
Stop!

3314
03:54:37,980 --> 03:54:39,020
You're scaring me.

3315
03:54:39,020 --> 03:54:39,820
I'm in an atlas.

3316
03:54:39,820 --> 03:54:40,380
I'm so slow.

3317
03:54:40,380 --> 03:54:41,820
I can't even fly.

3318
03:54:41,820 --> 03:54:44,060
No, it's another get the convoy for the getaway mission.

3319
03:54:44,060 --> 03:54:44,380
Drat!

3320
03:54:44,940 --> 03:54:45,180
Right.

3321
03:54:45,180 --> 03:54:46,780
At least we know to destroy the bridge.

3322
03:54:47,420 --> 03:54:49,580
And then I'll pick up whatever they drop.

3323
03:54:50,700 --> 03:54:51,900
Okay, there is a fight.

3324
03:54:51,900 --> 03:54:52,780
That's what I want to hear.

3325
03:54:52,780 --> 03:54:54,140
That's exactly what I want to hear.

3326
03:54:55,180 --> 03:54:56,460
I actually want a fight

3327
03:54:56,460 --> 03:54:58,300
because I need my stuff a little bit.

3328
03:54:59,740 --> 03:55:00,140
Okay.

3329
03:55:00,780 --> 03:55:01,260
Okay.

3330
03:55:02,540 --> 03:55:03,500
You're flying.

3331
03:55:03,500 --> 03:55:05,100
You're flying.

3332
03:55:05,100 --> 03:55:05,900
You're flying.

3333
03:55:07,500 --> 03:55:08,300
You're flying.

3334
03:55:15,180 --> 03:55:16,380
You get too close,

3335
03:55:16,380 --> 03:55:18,060
but I want to pick up the kiddies.

3336
03:55:19,980 --> 03:55:21,420
Okay, then we go next.

3337
03:55:22,380 --> 03:55:23,500
Next convoy.

3338
03:55:23,500 --> 03:55:24,460
Are they up there?

3339
03:55:24,460 --> 03:55:25,820
Oh, please tell me they're not up there.

3340
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:28,380
Why would you do something to me like this?

3341
03:55:28,380 --> 03:55:29,500
How am I supposed to get off?

3342
03:55:29,500 --> 03:55:30,220
I'm not going back.

3343
03:55:33,100 --> 03:55:35,900
I haven't even unlocked Wild Card and Bind and Avis.

3344
03:55:35,900 --> 03:55:37,260
Like I'm like 99% sure

3345
03:55:37,260 --> 03:55:39,420
because I've never had, came across one yet.

3346
03:55:39,420 --> 03:55:41,020
I'll show you what my save file looks like

3347
03:55:41,020 --> 03:55:41,900
in the Bind and Avis.

3348
03:55:44,060 --> 03:55:45,820
You guys can be the judge.

3349
03:55:46,780 --> 03:55:47,820
That's why in November,

3350
03:55:47,820 --> 03:55:49,020
you guys are actually going to help me

3351
03:55:49,020 --> 03:55:50,060
fill the unlocks I need.

3352
03:55:50,620 --> 03:55:53,420
I think we might do one Eden run

3353
03:55:53,420 --> 03:55:55,180
on the Bind and Avis stream.

3354
03:55:55,180 --> 03:55:57,500
And then I want to play Lilith's read mode.

3355
03:55:57,500 --> 03:56:01,020
Some people absolutely despise read mode.

3356
03:56:01,020 --> 03:56:02,620
I actually quite like it.

3357
03:56:03,420 --> 03:56:05,180
I find it quite fun,

3358
03:56:05,180 --> 03:56:07,580
but only if it goes well, obviously.

3359
03:56:07,740 --> 03:56:11,500
Mercenaries, you will force me to abandon this world

3360
03:56:11,500 --> 03:56:13,020
and all it hides.

3361
03:56:13,020 --> 03:56:15,420
For that, you will face death.

3362
03:56:16,460 --> 03:56:19,180
Foster, can the Icarus get us off this rock yet?

3363
03:56:19,180 --> 03:56:19,820
No, sir.

3364
03:56:19,820 --> 03:56:21,260
Just local hops.

3365
03:56:21,260 --> 03:56:23,020
Captain, return to the Icarus.

3366
03:56:23,020 --> 03:56:23,420
We're going to-

3367
03:56:23,420 --> 03:56:23,900
Was this?

3368
03:56:23,900 --> 03:56:25,260
Oh, I almost lost.

3369
03:56:25,260 --> 03:56:26,380
This is the end of the map.

3370
03:56:26,380 --> 03:56:27,100
Holy crap.

3371
03:56:27,100 --> 03:56:27,660
Oh, my God.

3372
03:56:29,500 --> 03:56:29,980
Whoops.

3373
03:56:31,500 --> 03:56:33,420
I honestly don't mind read mode.

3374
03:56:33,420 --> 03:56:35,980
Who despised read mode is really hard.

3375
03:56:36,060 --> 03:56:38,540
Begin our best interest to capture whatever lost technology

3376
03:56:38,540 --> 03:56:40,140
is being evacuated with him.

3377
03:56:40,140 --> 03:56:41,660
Assault space port.

3378
03:56:41,660 --> 03:56:42,860
Someone has to go into a heavily guarded space port,

3379
03:56:42,860 --> 03:56:44,140
blow the Blake drop ship,

3380
03:56:44,140 --> 03:56:46,140
and kill or strand straighter.

3381
03:56:46,140 --> 03:56:47,580
Guess who gets the job?

3382
03:56:47,580 --> 03:56:48,300
Not it.

3383
03:56:48,300 --> 03:56:49,980
Right, you are a briefing boy.

3384
03:56:49,980 --> 03:56:51,260
Good luck, Captain.

3385
03:56:51,260 --> 03:56:52,620
Foster, your job.

3386
03:56:52,620 --> 03:56:54,300
You need to get the drop ship fixed

3387
03:56:54,300 --> 03:56:56,940
so we can get off this planet and enjoy our R&R,

3388
03:56:56,940 --> 03:56:58,780
after our esteemed captain gets done.

3389
03:56:58,780 --> 03:56:59,980
That has like a billion enemies in it.

3390
03:56:59,980 --> 03:57:01,500
As soon as you unlock the Atlas, Lilith,

3391
03:57:01,500 --> 03:57:04,140
it's not too, it's not too tricky.

3392
03:57:04,140 --> 03:57:05,020
Two more missions.

3393
03:57:06,140 --> 03:57:06,620
Oh, my God.

3394
03:57:06,620 --> 03:57:07,980
We're beating the game journalist.

3395
03:57:11,660 --> 03:57:13,020
We're beating the game journalist.

3396
03:57:13,020 --> 03:57:13,420
Let's go.

3397
03:57:15,980 --> 03:57:17,420
Is the game sent me the wrong way?

3398
03:57:18,620 --> 03:57:19,100
No.

3399
03:57:19,100 --> 03:57:19,900
I'm being pranked.

3400
03:57:21,340 --> 03:57:21,740
Clearly.

3401
03:57:26,380 --> 03:57:27,740
You're blowing it right now.

3402
03:57:27,740 --> 03:57:29,580
Can I get across this one first, please?

3403
03:57:34,460 --> 03:57:35,340
Okay, now.

3404
03:57:36,140 --> 03:57:37,740
I saw my life flash before my eyes.

3405
03:57:42,380 --> 03:57:42,940
Oh, my God.

3406
03:57:45,020 --> 03:57:46,540
Is this another timed mission?

3407
03:57:46,540 --> 03:57:47,100
Yes or no?

3408
03:57:48,060 --> 03:57:49,500
That would have time to be fucking around

3409
03:57:49,500 --> 03:57:50,460
and destroying stuff.

3410
03:57:51,820 --> 03:57:52,940
Oh, they have full health.

3411
03:57:53,580 --> 03:57:55,100
Man, this game is short.

3412
03:57:55,100 --> 03:57:57,020
Older games tend to be like that,

3413
03:57:57,020 --> 03:57:58,780
although I think Conker's Bad Party

3414
03:57:58,780 --> 03:58:01,340
is the only game that was like old AF,

3415
03:58:01,340 --> 03:58:03,260
and it was like took so long to do.

3416
03:58:03,260 --> 03:58:05,020
I mean, I've never completed it.

3417
03:58:05,020 --> 03:58:06,780
I used to play the same mission as a child

3418
03:58:06,780 --> 03:58:08,620
and then get stuck at the exact same spot,

3419
03:58:08,620 --> 03:58:11,340
which honestly, that game was wildly inappropriate for me,

3420
03:58:11,340 --> 03:58:13,340
inappropriate for me to be playing as a child,

3421
03:58:13,340 --> 03:58:16,780
but hey, it gave me a personality,

3422
03:58:16,780 --> 03:58:20,060
so I can't actually say anything bad against it.

3423
03:58:22,460 --> 03:58:24,380
I'd actually be so boring if I didn't game.

3424
03:58:25,020 --> 03:58:27,740
I don't even think I would have anything to say to them.

3425
03:58:27,740 --> 03:58:30,780
I'd probably be like a mukbang type of person

3426
03:58:32,940 --> 03:58:34,460
and just watch people eat food all day.

3427
03:58:34,460 --> 03:58:37,820
I'd be like, oh yeah, this is time for it again.

3428
03:58:41,820 --> 03:58:43,420
You're so in my face.

3429
03:58:47,500 --> 03:58:51,500
No, no, okay, let's go again.

3430
03:58:52,940 --> 03:58:55,580
Oh, okay, let's go again.

3431
03:58:55,580 --> 03:58:56,940
Again, again, again, again, again, again.

3432
03:58:56,940 --> 03:58:59,260
That was my humble mistake.

3433
03:58:59,260 --> 03:59:00,700
That was my humble mistake.

3434
03:59:00,700 --> 03:59:01,820
I do apologize.

3435
03:59:02,380 --> 03:59:04,540
Literally went for a cheeky dip in the thing.

3436
03:59:06,380 --> 03:59:09,260
The only thing that can kill me is myself.

3437
03:59:09,260 --> 03:59:10,700
I am back to the video game.

3438
03:59:11,580 --> 03:59:13,580
Okay, I need to sprint across the bridge

3439
03:59:13,580 --> 03:59:15,180
because they're going to blow it up.

3440
03:59:15,180 --> 03:59:17,100
I cannot believe I just did that.

3441
03:59:17,100 --> 03:59:19,260
Into the flaming hot Cheetos.

3442
03:59:19,260 --> 03:59:20,780
Literally, what an air.

3443
03:59:22,620 --> 03:59:25,820
I can't believe I successfully managed that as hilarious.

3444
03:59:27,820 --> 03:59:29,100
I'm so energy-honored.

3445
03:59:29,820 --> 03:59:33,340
I don't know how I'm not in some e-sports team.

3446
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:33,820
Is that good?

3447
03:59:35,340 --> 03:59:37,180
Not only am I terrible at the game.

3448
03:59:41,340 --> 03:59:42,220
Let's try that again.

3449
03:59:42,780 --> 03:59:44,860
This time, no perish.

3450
03:59:46,540 --> 03:59:47,180
I'm pretty cheeky.

3451
03:59:47,180 --> 03:59:49,260
Speaking, talking about hot sprang.

3452
03:59:51,020 --> 03:59:52,620
Yeah, Conqueror's had Inuit on it.

3453
03:59:52,620 --> 03:59:56,780
I, the childhood memory for me playing Conqueror's Bad Friday

3454
03:59:56,780 --> 03:59:58,620
is bouncing on that sunflowers.

3455
03:59:59,500 --> 04:00:00,300
Nothing else.

3456
04:00:00,300 --> 04:00:02,860
I used to do it for minutes at a time.

3457
04:00:02,860 --> 04:00:05,340
And then whenever I could hear my mom or dad come into the room,

3458
04:00:05,340 --> 04:00:09,020
I'd get off them because I'd be scared they'd be mad at me.

3459
04:00:09,020 --> 04:00:11,020
And they'd be like, what are you doing, strongy?

3460
04:00:16,140 --> 04:00:17,180
Right, do not fall.

3461
04:00:17,180 --> 04:00:18,380
Whoa, you idle.

3462
04:00:19,740 --> 04:00:21,020
They had a funny little ha-ha.

3463
04:00:25,020 --> 04:00:25,660
Oh, jeez.

3464
04:00:26,220 --> 04:00:28,220
Everything's got an HP up there.

3465
04:00:30,300 --> 04:00:32,220
You're not actually supposed to get stronger.

3466
04:00:32,220 --> 04:00:33,180
You should get weaker.

3467
04:00:35,980 --> 04:00:38,060
Right, do not fall off the map with time.

3468
04:00:38,060 --> 04:00:40,540
Even if the mix gets all the way in my face.

3469
04:00:42,380 --> 04:00:45,020
Oh my god, it's so fast compared to me.

3470
04:00:45,020 --> 04:00:47,740
I think, oh my god, such a fast mix.

3471
04:00:47,740 --> 04:00:48,380
Please stop.

3472
04:00:49,020 --> 04:00:49,900
Please, I beg you.

3473
04:00:50,540 --> 04:00:51,180
Give me a gun.

3474
04:00:54,140 --> 04:00:55,980
Yeah, I don't think going invisible at this stage

3475
04:00:55,980 --> 04:00:57,500
won't do anything for you, buddy.

3476
04:00:57,500 --> 04:00:59,260
Please do not drop your guns on them.

3477
04:01:01,980 --> 04:01:03,340
Is there anything else here?

3478
04:01:03,340 --> 04:01:04,540
Or is this just like a...

3479
04:01:08,540 --> 04:01:10,380
I am the great mate even.

3480
04:01:12,860 --> 04:01:13,980
Oh, is this a dead end?

3481
04:01:13,980 --> 04:01:15,420
OK, so I have to go that way.

3482
04:01:15,420 --> 04:01:17,340
Maybe we can get a few licks in though.

3483
04:01:17,340 --> 04:01:17,980
Yeah, we can.

3484
04:01:18,940 --> 04:01:19,820
Look at that.

3485
04:01:19,820 --> 04:01:20,540
That was a good lick.

3486
04:01:21,980 --> 04:01:23,020
That was a good lick.

3487
04:01:23,020 --> 04:01:24,300
Something, something red there.

3488
04:01:24,300 --> 04:01:24,780
Let's get it.

3489
04:01:26,780 --> 04:01:28,220
I love doing stuff from a distance.

3490
04:01:29,580 --> 04:01:30,940
I'd save some of our HP.

3491
04:01:32,140 --> 04:01:33,900
I hate the Dracula.

3492
04:01:34,780 --> 04:01:36,940
I never got to that stage as a child.

3493
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:38,540
I unlocked the Sunflower,

3494
04:01:38,540 --> 04:01:40,540
and then I think after that I was just like,

3495
04:01:40,540 --> 04:01:42,460
I couldn't progress because I didn't know what was going on.

3496
04:01:43,980 --> 04:01:45,260
OK, there's a lava flume.

3497
04:01:45,820 --> 04:01:47,500
I guess I will love it.

3498
04:01:48,140 --> 04:01:50,140
I will allow a lava flume.

3499
04:01:50,140 --> 04:01:50,780
Just one, though.

3500
04:01:51,580 --> 04:01:54,700
There shall be no other lava flumming near me.

3501
04:01:54,700 --> 04:01:55,260
Oh, OK.

3502
04:01:55,260 --> 04:01:56,540
Well, that's illegal to do that.

3503
04:01:59,020 --> 04:02:00,460
Am I to destroy this?

3504
04:02:00,460 --> 04:02:02,220
Gain access to the spaceport.

3505
04:02:03,900 --> 04:02:04,460
OK, is it?

3506
04:02:05,980 --> 04:02:06,860
Aren't you at me?

3507
04:02:09,420 --> 04:02:09,980
Space...

3508
04:02:10,700 --> 04:02:11,260
Space...

3509
04:02:11,260 --> 04:02:13,020
I want to do a cheeky U-turn.

3510
04:02:14,780 --> 04:02:15,820
Cheeky U-turn moment.

3511
04:02:18,540 --> 04:02:19,100
Nah.

3512
04:02:19,100 --> 04:02:20,700
I hate when they get a lick on me when I'm...

3513
04:02:23,340 --> 04:02:24,620
The 80s, what do you mean?

3514
04:02:25,740 --> 04:02:27,820
Way too distracted by Sunflower Booba.

3515
04:02:27,820 --> 04:02:30,700
I did the pitchfork in Bunker's...

3516
04:02:30,700 --> 04:02:32,060
Bunker's Kites for...

3517
04:02:33,100 --> 04:02:34,780
Conqueror's Bad Ferdy.

3518
04:02:34,780 --> 04:02:37,180
I did the pitchfork inside the hay bale.

3519
04:02:38,060 --> 04:02:40,860
I did the Booba Sunflower,

3520
04:02:40,860 --> 04:02:42,620
and then after that I just kinda...

3521
04:02:42,620 --> 04:02:43,660
Like, I did the wasp.

3522
04:02:45,260 --> 04:02:46,220
I did the bull,

3523
04:02:46,220 --> 04:02:47,260
and then after the bull,

3524
04:02:47,260 --> 04:02:48,620
I think I got stuck in the bale.

3525
04:02:48,620 --> 04:02:49,900
I actually don't know how to progress,

3526
04:02:49,900 --> 04:02:51,180
so you guys don't have to hold my hand

3527
04:02:51,180 --> 04:02:52,780
when we get that game shot.

3528
04:02:53,500 --> 04:02:55,420
I don't know if we can get achievements for it,

3529
04:02:55,420 --> 04:02:56,940
because it's on rare replay,

3530
04:02:57,820 --> 04:03:00,540
but I don't know how the achievements work in that game.

3531
04:03:01,340 --> 04:03:05,500
Obviously, this is made before achievements really were a thing.

3532
04:03:07,020 --> 04:03:07,980
Entertuality.

3533
04:03:08,540 --> 04:03:09,020
Hold on.

3534
04:03:10,940 --> 04:03:12,940
I'm trying to, like, rotate between both...

3535
04:03:13,820 --> 04:03:14,320
Eh.

3536
04:03:15,660 --> 04:03:18,060
The missiles and the shotgun.

3537
04:03:18,060 --> 04:03:19,580
It seems to be very efficient,

3538
04:03:19,580 --> 04:03:20,700
which I'm quite happy with.

3539
04:03:25,260 --> 04:03:25,760
Take...

3540
04:03:27,820 --> 04:03:28,320
Woah!

3541
04:03:29,100 --> 04:03:30,220
Those are low keys!

3542
04:03:31,100 --> 04:03:32,620
They're so fucking skinny!

3543
04:03:33,660 --> 04:03:35,740
And, oh god, they have such high mobility.

3544
04:03:35,740 --> 04:03:37,260
This shouldn't be awful.

3545
04:03:37,260 --> 04:03:38,380
But they have low health.

3546
04:03:38,380 --> 04:03:39,340
That's my benefit.

3547
04:03:39,340 --> 04:03:40,060
They have low health.

3548
04:03:43,900 --> 04:03:45,580
I love when they just take it,

3549
04:03:45,580 --> 04:03:46,860
like a good little mech.

3550
04:03:46,860 --> 04:03:48,300
Honestly, you're such a good mech.

3551
04:03:51,020 --> 04:03:52,700
They double killed each other!

3552
04:03:54,540 --> 04:03:55,500
Oh my god.

3553
04:03:55,500 --> 04:03:57,020
I love when they take it, sorry,

3554
04:03:57,020 --> 04:03:58,860
but, like, literally,

3555
04:03:58,860 --> 04:04:00,220
this is the best feeling ever.

3556
04:04:05,020 --> 04:04:05,900
Two for one.

3557
04:04:05,900 --> 04:04:07,660
Yeah, their HP is literally so low.

3558
04:04:13,020 --> 04:04:14,300
Okay, blow up the tunnel.

3559
04:04:14,300 --> 04:04:15,100
Got it.

3560
04:04:15,100 --> 04:04:15,740
Or the bridge.

3561
04:04:15,740 --> 04:04:16,460
I don't know what one.

3562
04:04:17,740 --> 04:04:18,380
Then the bridge?

3563
04:04:21,100 --> 04:04:22,140
I just waste this one.

3564
04:04:22,140 --> 04:04:23,660
I know it doesn't do as much damage,

3565
04:04:23,660 --> 04:04:24,540
but I don't want to, like,

3566
04:04:25,900 --> 04:04:27,580
waste my good ammo on it.

3567
04:04:33,180 --> 04:04:34,460
If you like more old games,

3568
04:04:34,460 --> 04:04:35,180
and then good game,

3569
04:04:35,980 --> 04:04:36,860
good old games,

3570
04:04:36,860 --> 04:04:37,580
it's, like, for steam,

3571
04:04:37,580 --> 04:04:38,940
but some obscure stuff.

3572
04:04:38,940 --> 04:04:39,580
Mmm.

3573
04:04:39,580 --> 04:04:41,500
Their problem is I can only play games

3574
04:04:41,500 --> 04:04:43,260
that I've had experience before,

3575
04:04:43,260 --> 04:04:44,220
or seen be played,

3576
04:04:45,740 --> 04:04:47,660
which is why I play games like Mech Assault,

3577
04:04:47,660 --> 04:04:48,940
because I've seen my dad play it

3578
04:04:48,940 --> 04:04:50,460
like a million times over.

3579
04:04:52,460 --> 04:04:53,420
Oh, there's health there.

3580
04:04:55,500 --> 04:04:57,420
Oh, and there's a helicopter coming.

3581
04:04:57,420 --> 04:04:58,140
Oh, there.

3582
04:04:58,140 --> 04:04:58,460
Sorry.

3583
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:00,380
I'm using the HUD,

3584
04:05:00,380 --> 04:05:01,500
and then looking at the same time,

3585
04:05:01,500 --> 04:05:02,780
which is the cause of me being there.

3586
04:05:03,340 --> 04:05:03,580
Oh, no.

3587
04:05:09,580 --> 04:05:10,300
Gee.

3588
04:05:10,300 --> 04:05:11,660
I just picked the health up.

3589
04:05:11,660 --> 04:05:12,860
Give me a second to do that.

3590
04:05:13,980 --> 04:05:15,980
And your dad's in school.

3591
04:05:15,980 --> 04:05:17,740
He plays mostly mobile games.

3592
04:05:17,740 --> 04:05:20,380
He tried to get into Starcraft for a bit.

3593
04:05:20,380 --> 04:05:21,340
He got in the floor,

3594
04:05:21,340 --> 04:05:22,860
so he doesn't game that much,

3595
04:05:22,860 --> 04:05:24,540
but we're going to play another game

3596
04:05:24,540 --> 04:05:25,980
called Halo Wars.

3597
04:05:25,980 --> 04:05:28,380
He was fucking addicted to that shit.

3598
04:05:28,380 --> 04:05:29,740
Holy crap.

3599
04:05:29,740 --> 04:05:30,940
He can get enough of it.

3600
04:05:31,900 --> 04:05:34,620
And the difficulty can increase,

3601
04:05:35,260 --> 04:05:38,220
and he got to a stupid, silly number

3602
04:05:38,220 --> 04:05:39,100
and difficulty,

3603
04:05:39,100 --> 04:05:40,220
which is honestly insane.

3604
04:05:41,020 --> 04:05:42,540
Oh, my God, Halo Wars.

3605
04:05:42,540 --> 04:05:44,780
Yeah, you guys have played Halo Wars, too.

3606
04:05:46,780 --> 04:05:48,540
I'm not going to lie, Reefland.

3607
04:05:48,540 --> 04:05:50,140
You'd get along with my dad very well.

3608
04:05:52,460 --> 04:05:53,580
He was addicted to it,

3609
04:05:53,580 --> 04:05:55,420
so we're definitely going to give Halo Wars a bash,

3610
04:05:55,420 --> 04:05:57,100
but it's quite long.

3611
04:05:57,100 --> 04:05:58,380
If I remember correctly,

3612
04:05:58,380 --> 04:05:59,260
it's a long game.

3613
04:05:59,260 --> 04:06:00,460
It's not like a...

3614
04:06:00,460 --> 04:06:02,060
I think it may even be a two-streamer.

3615
04:06:04,620 --> 04:06:05,420
Nope, I missed.

3616
04:06:09,260 --> 04:06:09,820
No!

3617
04:06:10,860 --> 04:06:11,420
I got him.

3618
04:06:13,180 --> 04:06:13,580
Uh...

3619
04:06:15,100 --> 04:06:16,460
Okay, there is a health spot.

3620
04:06:16,460 --> 04:06:17,020
I think...

3621
04:06:17,820 --> 04:06:18,780
I don't need it right now.

3622
04:06:18,780 --> 04:06:19,660
I'm actually still health.

3623
04:06:19,660 --> 04:06:20,300
I mean...

3624
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:25,180
My dad has quite literally taught me

3625
04:06:25,180 --> 04:06:27,020
everything I needed to know about this game.

3626
04:06:27,900 --> 04:06:30,540
Okay, the doors are open.

3627
04:06:32,540 --> 04:06:33,420
Is this a fight?

3628
04:06:33,420 --> 04:06:34,620
If I've ever seen one,

3629
04:06:34,620 --> 04:06:36,140
it certainly looks like it.

3630
04:06:39,100 --> 04:06:40,140
I think we'll try and talk.

3631
04:06:41,580 --> 04:06:43,500
There's something going on over here.

3632
04:06:43,500 --> 04:06:44,300
I don't like it.

3633
04:06:45,180 --> 04:06:46,060
Is it a plan?

3634
04:06:46,780 --> 04:06:47,820
There's quite a few...

3635
04:06:47,820 --> 04:06:49,340
Oh, it's that building there.

3636
04:06:49,340 --> 04:06:50,620
Okay, I see it.

3637
04:06:50,620 --> 04:06:51,260
Hold on.

3638
04:06:51,260 --> 04:06:52,220
Let's get rid of it now.

3639
04:06:53,340 --> 04:06:54,940
We don't have problems.

3640
04:06:54,940 --> 04:06:56,860
Okay, that's what we want to see.

3641
04:06:57,980 --> 04:06:58,860
Take your time.

3642
04:06:58,860 --> 04:06:59,500
Take your time.

3643
04:07:00,540 --> 04:07:01,660
Time is on our side.

3644
04:07:01,660 --> 04:07:02,540
Health is on our side.

3645
04:07:02,540 --> 04:07:03,340
We don't need to be...

3646
04:07:04,460 --> 04:07:06,700
Going absolutely fast as far as I'm aware.

3647
04:07:08,220 --> 04:07:09,820
Unless maybe we do have enough.

3648
04:07:09,820 --> 04:07:10,380
Oh, there is.

3649
04:07:12,620 --> 04:07:14,620
We are over keeping quite nasty.

3650
04:07:17,260 --> 04:07:20,780
Did my dad ever try Warcraft?

3651
04:07:20,780 --> 04:07:22,620
I don't think so.

3652
04:07:22,620 --> 04:07:23,740
He tried Starcraft.

3653
04:07:23,740 --> 04:07:25,340
He got into a wee bit,

3654
04:07:25,420 --> 04:07:27,420
but I wasn't saying he went MLG crazy.

3655
04:07:31,580 --> 04:07:34,140
But he doesn't really game that much these days

3656
04:07:34,140 --> 04:07:35,180
because of his work,

3657
04:07:35,180 --> 04:07:39,500
but I'm hoping I can retire him next year.

3658
04:07:40,060 --> 04:07:42,060
So, obviously,

3659
04:07:42,060 --> 04:07:44,700
I've got quite a lot of motivational factors.

3660
04:07:44,700 --> 04:07:47,740
Like, the girls motivate me to work hard.

3661
04:07:47,740 --> 04:07:49,660
Like, my dad motivates me to work hard.

3662
04:07:49,660 --> 04:07:51,820
But like, in the nicest way,

3663
04:07:52,780 --> 04:07:55,580
like, if my dad wasn't cool with me gaming,

3664
04:07:55,580 --> 04:07:57,820
like, you guys tell me stories about your parents

3665
04:07:57,820 --> 04:07:59,180
kind of being a bit obtuse,

3666
04:07:59,180 --> 04:08:02,060
like, when you like, game or whatever.

3667
04:08:02,060 --> 04:08:06,140
If my dad wasn't like, cool enough to get into Xbox

3668
04:08:06,140 --> 04:08:07,820
and like, get online and all of that,

3669
04:08:07,820 --> 04:08:09,100
like, I wouldn't be a gamer.

3670
04:08:09,100 --> 04:08:10,460
I'd probably be like,

3671
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:12,220
Ew, ew, makeup!

3672
04:08:12,220 --> 04:08:12,780
Ew, ew!

3673
04:08:13,660 --> 04:08:16,300
Oh, I love going out to nightclubs

3674
04:08:16,300 --> 04:08:17,980
and grinding on people.

3675
04:08:17,980 --> 04:08:19,020
Oh, like,

3676
04:08:19,740 --> 04:08:22,140
So, I do feel like, oh, my dad or whatever,

3677
04:08:22,140 --> 04:08:22,780
how it came up.

3678
04:08:22,780 --> 04:08:23,820
Like, my mom as well,

3679
04:08:23,820 --> 04:08:25,580
she never had any issues with gaming

3680
04:08:25,580 --> 04:08:26,540
because my dad's game,

3681
04:08:26,540 --> 04:08:27,980
so my mom was like, well, I don't,

3682
04:08:27,980 --> 04:08:28,780
I couldn't get to...

3683
04:08:31,260 --> 04:08:31,760
Oh?

3684
04:08:41,980 --> 04:08:42,480
Uh...

3685
04:08:44,620 --> 04:08:45,660
I don't remember that.

3686
04:08:49,580 --> 04:08:50,080
Okay.

3687
04:08:53,260 --> 04:08:55,260
Take it, take it, take it.

3688
04:08:55,260 --> 04:08:55,980
Yep, that's right.

3689
04:08:55,980 --> 04:08:57,100
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

3690
04:08:57,100 --> 04:08:58,220
Give him everything I got.

3691
04:08:59,580 --> 04:09:00,060
Come on.

3692
04:09:00,780 --> 04:09:01,820
Come on, buddy.

3693
04:09:01,820 --> 04:09:02,300
Parish.

3694
04:09:03,340 --> 04:09:04,140
That's all we'll see.

3695
04:09:04,140 --> 04:09:04,700
Right, you're next.

3696
04:09:07,420 --> 04:09:08,460
Okay, that's all I want to see.

3697
04:09:08,460 --> 04:09:09,260
That's all I want to see.

3698
04:09:10,220 --> 04:09:10,780
Come on.

3699
04:09:12,220 --> 04:09:13,020
Oh, look.

3700
04:09:13,020 --> 04:09:15,180
Yeah, if you have an invisible guy,

3701
04:09:15,180 --> 04:09:15,740
if you shoot,

3702
04:09:15,740 --> 04:09:17,740
he becomes less invisible in the multiplayer.

3703
04:09:17,740 --> 04:09:18,380
Whoa!

3704
04:09:18,380 --> 04:09:19,580
Not what we want to see.

3705
04:09:19,580 --> 04:09:20,060
Hold on.

3706
04:09:20,700 --> 04:09:21,980
Let's get rid of this building.

3707
04:09:21,980 --> 04:09:22,780
Not what we want to see.

3708
04:09:22,780 --> 04:09:24,620
We don't want him to respawn on enemies.

3709
04:09:26,140 --> 04:09:26,620
Come on.

3710
04:09:27,180 --> 04:09:27,980
There we go.

3711
04:09:27,980 --> 04:09:28,460
There we go.

3712
04:09:28,460 --> 04:09:29,180
We don't want that.

3713
04:09:29,180 --> 04:09:29,660
We don't want that.

3714
04:09:32,140 --> 04:09:34,540
Unfortunately, I'm very, uh...

3715
04:09:36,140 --> 04:09:36,780
Overkeating.

3716
04:09:38,540 --> 04:09:41,180
And these guys move left to right so quickly.

3717
04:09:41,900 --> 04:09:43,100
Oh, God, please hurt him.

3718
04:09:44,140 --> 04:09:44,380
Oh!

3719
04:09:45,820 --> 04:09:46,940
Oh, that's a...

3720
04:09:46,940 --> 04:09:48,860
I need to change that to my donal sound.

3721
04:09:48,860 --> 04:09:50,460
The sound of them exploding

3722
04:09:50,460 --> 04:09:52,380
is just like such a good sound effect.

3723
04:09:52,380 --> 04:09:53,100
Like, shaw.

3724
04:09:54,700 --> 04:09:55,420
That is so good.

3725
04:09:55,980 --> 04:09:56,620
Let's get rid of you.

3726
04:09:57,980 --> 04:09:59,260
Uh, looks like...

3727
04:09:59,820 --> 04:10:00,700
Oh, there we go.

3728
04:10:00,700 --> 04:10:00,940
Right.

3729
04:10:02,380 --> 04:10:03,340
Mama Dad gamed a bit,

3730
04:10:03,340 --> 04:10:04,780
but he stopped less the time going on.

3731
04:10:04,780 --> 04:10:07,100
Oh, my mom was like a Lara Croft e-girl.

3732
04:10:07,100 --> 04:10:08,140
She loves Lara Croft.

3733
04:10:08,940 --> 04:10:10,140
She loves the movies as well.

3734
04:10:10,140 --> 04:10:12,060
We should watch Lara Croft movies for my mom,

3735
04:10:12,060 --> 04:10:14,540
because I feel at home with it like I don't.

3736
04:10:14,540 --> 04:10:15,500
I need to do what again?

3737
04:10:16,460 --> 04:10:17,260
Shit!

3738
04:10:17,260 --> 04:10:18,300
I spoke over it.

3739
04:10:19,100 --> 04:10:19,660
The doors?

3740
04:10:22,700 --> 04:10:23,260
I don't know.

3741
04:10:23,820 --> 04:10:24,220
Oh, shit.

3742
04:10:25,660 --> 04:10:26,540
What am I to do?

3743
04:10:26,540 --> 04:10:26,940
Hello?

3744
04:10:27,580 --> 04:10:29,580
Then you make us all players a little bit of attention.

3745
04:10:30,540 --> 04:10:30,860
This?

3746
04:10:32,220 --> 04:10:32,620
Shit.

3747
04:10:35,180 --> 04:10:36,220
Doors can't be blown.

3748
04:10:38,380 --> 04:10:39,820
What, you calling yourself a door?

3749
04:10:39,820 --> 04:10:41,340
Calling yourself a challenge for me?

3750
04:10:41,340 --> 04:10:41,980
Am I being dumb?

3751
04:10:46,460 --> 04:10:48,460
Camera pan to the generators.

3752
04:10:48,460 --> 04:10:49,420
Find another way.

3753
04:10:49,420 --> 04:10:51,820
Okay, as long as we're not on a timed mission, right?

3754
04:10:52,460 --> 04:10:54,540
Haha, what if we're on a timed mission right now?

3755
04:10:55,500 --> 04:10:56,940
I was fucking around trying to look for...

3756
04:11:00,380 --> 04:11:03,420
Lara Croft and Joy are in a multiplayer mech assault smack talker.

3757
04:11:06,300 --> 04:11:07,020
When you guys are like,

3758
04:11:07,020 --> 04:11:08,140
uh, is your dad single?

3759
04:11:08,140 --> 04:11:09,180
Is your mom single?

3760
04:11:09,180 --> 04:11:09,500
No!

3761
04:11:10,380 --> 04:11:11,660
They're a gaming jewel!

3762
04:11:12,460 --> 04:11:15,900
And they have happy marriage.

3763
04:11:17,100 --> 04:11:18,780
And they have happy daughters.

3764
04:11:19,580 --> 04:11:20,860
And all is good in the world.

3765
04:11:20,860 --> 04:11:21,900
Oh, I see the generator.

3766
04:11:24,380 --> 04:11:26,780
I wonder if I, if I broke that before.

3767
04:11:27,660 --> 04:11:29,100
Would it have standard?

3768
04:11:30,380 --> 04:11:31,980
Is there a daughter single?

3769
04:11:32,780 --> 04:11:34,060
Do you want to meet my parents?

3770
04:11:34,780 --> 04:11:36,940
Would you be nervous if I brought them on stream?

3771
04:11:39,340 --> 04:11:40,700
Okay, now let's go fuck them up.

3772
04:11:42,140 --> 04:11:43,420
Bring my parents on stream.

3773
04:11:43,420 --> 04:11:43,980
Go to the...

3774
04:11:46,060 --> 04:11:48,140
We officially cannot hit on stories.

3775
04:11:48,140 --> 04:11:50,060
Do not hit on my mom and dad!

3776
04:11:51,020 --> 04:11:51,740
Honestly.

3777
04:11:53,820 --> 04:11:55,580
Do they want to be adopted?

3778
04:11:55,580 --> 04:11:56,860
Do you want to be my stepbrother?

3779
04:11:57,820 --> 04:12:01,420
Do you already know what kind of things I'm into?

3780
04:12:01,420 --> 04:12:03,100
Are you sure you want to be my stepbrother?

3781
04:12:05,980 --> 04:12:07,660
Yeah, I'll have you know what I created, I mean.

3782
04:12:08,060 --> 04:12:11,500
I don't think it happened.

3783
04:12:11,500 --> 04:12:13,580
Things would happen if you became my stepbrother.

3784
04:12:15,820 --> 04:12:17,420
Oh yeah, okay, okay.

3785
04:12:18,540 --> 04:12:19,740
All right, let's see what's going on.

3786
04:12:19,740 --> 04:12:22,140
Okay, the base doors just closed, which I don't like.

3787
04:12:22,140 --> 04:12:24,460
I'll bet that plane is loaded with goodness.

3788
04:12:24,460 --> 04:12:27,580
Destroy the drop ship or it can take off.

3789
04:12:27,580 --> 04:12:31,900
Well, considering you've locked me into a cut scene,

3790
04:12:31,900 --> 04:12:33,900
you know, it's really getting away, I have to admit.

3791
04:12:34,620 --> 04:12:35,660
It's really getting away.

3792
04:12:38,620 --> 04:12:39,900
Okay, I think that's it.

3793
04:12:39,900 --> 04:12:40,940
I didn't have much for it.

3794
04:12:41,500 --> 04:12:43,100
I'm like, hold on, there's an enemy.

3795
04:12:43,740 --> 04:12:44,620
Hold on, base.

3796
04:12:54,540 --> 04:12:55,420
Okay, hold on.

3797
04:12:55,420 --> 04:12:57,100
I think we're going to have to try hard a little bit.

3798
04:12:58,700 --> 04:13:00,700
Maybe we do a little bit of sweating.

3799
04:13:00,700 --> 04:13:02,540
Hold on, hold on, a little bit of sweating.

3800
04:13:03,260 --> 04:13:04,060
Just a wee bit.

3801
04:13:05,020 --> 04:13:07,100
Maybe, oh no, that's a terrible good one again.

3802
04:13:07,100 --> 04:13:08,060
Oh, and a clue.

3803
04:13:10,780 --> 04:13:12,060
I feel like he's so weak.

3804
04:13:12,620 --> 04:13:13,740
Oh, no, he's weak.

3805
04:13:13,740 --> 04:13:14,780
He's freaking glowing.

3806
04:13:17,820 --> 04:13:20,460
Wow, okay, that was good.

3807
04:13:20,460 --> 04:13:20,860
Bye.

3808
04:13:24,380 --> 04:13:25,820
Hot heals, I got the H.

3809
04:13:27,500 --> 04:13:29,340
There seems to be something up here.

3810
04:13:29,740 --> 04:13:30,220
Oh, hi there.

3811
04:13:33,340 --> 04:13:34,380
Whoa, the texture.

3812
04:13:35,020 --> 04:13:36,060
I don't know what it is.

3813
04:13:37,500 --> 04:13:38,460
I'm shooting at it anyway.

3814
04:13:44,060 --> 04:13:45,660
Definitely not having a lever.

3815
04:13:49,660 --> 04:13:51,180
Let's see if he can do the bit.

3816
04:13:52,620 --> 04:13:56,220
In the Disney music scene, I can do the bit.

3817
04:13:56,860 --> 04:13:58,300
Right, so this is just an end.

3818
04:13:58,300 --> 04:14:00,300
Okay, I am definitely not good at it.

3819
04:14:01,660 --> 04:14:03,100
What is going on over here?

3820
04:14:05,580 --> 04:14:07,180
I'd be nervous to meet my gran.

3821
04:14:08,540 --> 04:14:09,900
No, they shouldn't send love to you,

3822
04:14:09,900 --> 04:14:11,660
but I feel like she would be the protective one.

3823
04:14:13,180 --> 04:14:15,660
My gran's dead, so you don't have to worry about my gran?

3824
04:14:17,740 --> 04:14:20,300
Yeah, you don't need to worry about her approval.

3825
04:14:20,300 --> 04:14:22,860
She popped her cogs, so you're fine, Riflin.

3826
04:14:25,180 --> 04:14:26,860
Oh, that's funny as fuck.

3827
04:14:29,180 --> 04:14:33,580
Oh, honestly, it was just like, I'm like,

3828
04:14:33,580 --> 04:14:36,140
did I see it or did I just let it go?

3829
04:14:36,140 --> 04:14:37,740
I'm like, nah, that's actually kind of funny.

3830
04:14:39,500 --> 04:14:41,100
Oh, shit, here we go, here we go.

3831
04:14:41,900 --> 04:14:42,700
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3832
04:14:42,700 --> 04:14:43,660
Nah, don't worry about it.

3833
04:14:44,940 --> 04:14:46,460
It's not as painful.

3834
04:14:46,460 --> 04:14:47,580
Oh, shit, I'm going to miss it.

3835
04:14:47,580 --> 04:14:48,700
There's the dropship.

3836
04:14:48,700 --> 04:14:49,100
Kill it.

3837
04:14:49,100 --> 04:14:49,900
Wait, what?

3838
04:14:49,900 --> 04:14:51,020
What you saw, straighter?

3839
04:14:52,380 --> 04:14:52,780
What?

3840
04:14:55,660 --> 04:14:57,980
Nah, it was like Solar's fuck to talk about it.

3841
04:14:59,100 --> 04:15:01,420
Mercenary scum, you'll die now.

3842
04:15:01,420 --> 04:15:03,100
You'll face Ragnarok.

3843
04:15:04,300 --> 04:15:05,340
What is that?

3844
04:15:05,340 --> 04:15:07,420
That's not in any of our technical readouts.

3845
04:15:07,420 --> 04:15:09,100
Oh, my God, it's the Ragnarok.

3846
04:15:12,220 --> 04:15:13,660
Oh, my God, that's right.

3847
04:15:13,660 --> 04:15:15,340
His ultimate is invincibility.

3848
04:15:17,260 --> 04:15:18,380
Oh, my God.

3849
04:15:18,380 --> 04:15:21,020
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

3850
04:15:21,020 --> 04:15:22,300
I completely forgot.

3851
04:15:22,300 --> 04:15:22,940
I forgot.

3852
04:15:23,580 --> 04:15:24,380
Holy shit.

3853
04:15:24,380 --> 04:15:25,420
I forgot everything.

3854
04:15:25,420 --> 04:15:26,140
Just send everything.

3855
04:15:26,860 --> 04:15:27,660
Call the guards.

3856
04:15:27,660 --> 04:15:28,300
Call the guards.

3857
04:15:29,180 --> 04:15:30,700
Oh, my God.

3858
04:15:30,700 --> 04:15:33,500
Oh, my God, he's fucking annihilating me for another day.

3859
04:15:34,460 --> 04:15:34,940
Oh, my God.

3860
04:15:37,100 --> 04:15:37,820
Show mercy.

3861
04:15:39,260 --> 04:15:40,380
Show mercy, Modis.

3862
04:15:40,380 --> 04:15:41,500
Show me mercy, Modis.

3863
04:15:41,500 --> 04:15:44,380
Oh, my God, his ultimate is that freaking three rocket attack.

3864
04:15:46,140 --> 04:15:47,660
I know he's got technology.

3865
04:15:47,660 --> 04:15:48,060
We haven't.

3866
04:15:58,380 --> 04:15:59,980
See you in hell, strainer.

3867
04:16:01,340 --> 04:16:02,060
Sorry, sirs.

3868
04:16:02,060 --> 04:16:03,580
Couldn't help myself.

3869
04:16:03,580 --> 04:16:04,940
Well done, Captain.

3870
04:16:04,940 --> 04:16:07,820
At least now we know what Ragnarok is, or it was.

3871
04:16:08,460 --> 04:16:12,460
Sir, too bad we couldn't capture it and analyze it.

3872
04:16:12,460 --> 04:16:13,980
Sir, what?

3873
04:16:13,980 --> 04:16:15,420
Look at the feet from the cameras.

3874
04:16:16,060 --> 04:16:17,180
Whoa, they had two?

3875
04:16:17,820 --> 04:16:19,180
Foster, send in the tech.

3876
04:16:19,180 --> 04:16:21,100
Oh, I thought I had to do a double fight there.

3877
04:16:21,100 --> 04:16:21,980
I was getting scared.

3878
04:16:21,980 --> 04:16:23,740
We need to stop the Stoom's Day device

3879
04:16:23,740 --> 04:16:25,180
and save this world.

3880
04:16:25,740 --> 04:16:26,460
Oh, thank God.

3881
04:16:31,260 --> 04:16:31,980
Oh, my God.

3882
04:16:33,980 --> 04:16:35,900
I thought we were going to have to do a second fight.

3883
04:16:35,900 --> 04:16:37,900
I was like, I'm wasting 50% health.

3884
04:16:42,940 --> 04:16:43,660
Ready to roll.

3885
04:16:55,180 --> 04:16:57,820
Oh, man, all of us are depending on you.

3886
04:16:57,820 --> 04:16:59,020
Got anything to add, Foster?

3887
04:16:59,660 --> 04:17:01,580
Drinks on me when you get back?

3888
04:17:01,580 --> 04:17:02,140
Good man.

3889
04:17:04,860 --> 04:17:07,180
OK, Ragnarok.

3890
04:17:07,180 --> 04:17:09,900
The Ragnarok is a unique prototype

3891
04:17:09,900 --> 04:17:14,780
built using Loth Tech to provide massive stopping power.

3892
04:17:16,860 --> 04:17:17,260
Wow.

3893
04:17:21,100 --> 04:17:22,540
Look at that swagger.

3894
04:17:25,260 --> 04:17:26,860
OK, let's see what we're dealing with.

3895
04:17:27,900 --> 04:17:30,700
OK, we've got sniper bullets, rockets.

3896
04:17:35,580 --> 04:17:36,620
Wait, and then...

3897
04:17:38,700 --> 04:17:40,060
Wait, then how do I get big...

3898
04:17:41,580 --> 04:17:42,220
How do I do the...

3899
04:17:44,860 --> 04:17:45,980
Wait, how do I do that?

3900
04:17:45,980 --> 04:17:46,460
Do that again.

3901
04:17:52,700 --> 04:17:53,660
What's the red?

3902
04:17:56,060 --> 04:17:57,900
I don't know what the red is.

3903
04:17:58,700 --> 04:17:59,900
But I didn't like it.

3904
04:18:02,060 --> 04:18:04,380
Have I had to secret Abeliae in all these mix

3905
04:18:04,380 --> 04:18:05,340
that haven't used before?

3906
04:18:10,460 --> 04:18:11,740
It's down on its arse.

3907
04:18:14,140 --> 04:18:14,620
Yeah.

3908
04:18:15,820 --> 04:18:16,380
Hold on.

3909
04:18:18,540 --> 04:18:19,660
OK, what the fuck?

3910
04:18:20,860 --> 04:18:21,340
Oh, OK.

3911
04:18:21,340 --> 04:18:21,820
Of course.

3912
04:18:21,820 --> 04:18:23,260
OK, let's see what we're dealing with.

3913
04:18:25,180 --> 04:18:25,740
Why would we...

3914
04:18:28,140 --> 04:18:29,180
All right, let's destroy that.

3915
04:18:30,700 --> 04:18:31,500
Holy shit.

3916
04:18:32,220 --> 04:18:34,220
I forget I have nothing to level with.

3917
04:18:34,220 --> 04:18:34,940
I'm not getting hit.

3918
04:18:36,300 --> 04:18:38,460
Now, I don't have as much health as the Atlas.

3919
04:18:41,500 --> 04:18:44,060
It's not letting me select that one.

3920
04:18:46,860 --> 04:18:49,020
Red is how long it takes to wield it.

3921
04:18:49,020 --> 04:18:52,700
I don't know if you know it or working with people.

3922
04:18:56,140 --> 04:18:56,940
Quick.

3923
04:18:57,500 --> 04:18:59,020
I'm fucking trying, hen.

3924
04:19:01,500 --> 04:19:03,420
Oh, my God, he's already on fire.

3925
04:19:03,420 --> 04:19:04,300
It's fantastic.

3926
04:19:06,780 --> 04:19:07,260
Wow.

3927
04:19:09,500 --> 04:19:10,300
Wow.

3928
04:19:11,660 --> 04:19:12,300
Oh, it's...

3929
04:19:12,300 --> 04:19:13,100
I'm going to sneeze.

3930
04:19:13,100 --> 04:19:13,900
It's so lovely.

3931
04:19:14,780 --> 04:19:15,980
It brings a tear to me.

3932
04:19:15,980 --> 04:19:18,140
Oh, how fucking easy it is with a regular ult.

3933
04:19:20,140 --> 04:19:24,300
OK, let's get right into this.

3934
04:19:25,180 --> 04:19:26,460
Wow, you can't do that to me.

3935
04:19:26,460 --> 04:19:27,260
That wasn't very nice.

3936
04:19:28,300 --> 04:19:29,420
Oh, this is a fuck up.

3937
04:19:34,220 --> 04:19:35,180
OK, get fucked.

3938
04:19:35,180 --> 04:19:36,220
Great, you fuck off.

3939
04:19:37,340 --> 04:19:37,980
Holy shit.

3940
04:19:41,580 --> 04:19:43,420
Yeah, I definitely do not have as much health.

3941
04:19:43,420 --> 04:19:44,060
Can you...

3942
04:19:44,060 --> 04:19:47,100
As if there's a wee bam up there shooting me as well.

3943
04:19:47,100 --> 04:19:47,500
Hold on.

3944
04:19:49,580 --> 04:19:50,060
Hold on.

3945
04:19:51,020 --> 04:19:51,980
Yeah, yeah.

3946
04:19:51,980 --> 04:19:52,940
Take that, bitch.

3947
04:19:54,540 --> 04:19:55,020
Hold on.

3948
04:19:55,500 --> 04:19:55,980
Inbop.

3949
04:19:59,660 --> 04:20:01,100
Sorry, I'm trying so hard.

3950
04:20:01,100 --> 04:20:03,500
I would actually love to do this in one.

3951
04:20:03,500 --> 04:20:05,820
Because the only time I totally lost

3952
04:20:05,820 --> 04:20:08,140
was that crazy runaway mission,

3953
04:20:08,140 --> 04:20:09,660
which you had to have known the layout

3954
04:20:09,660 --> 04:20:10,700
to even know what to do.

3955
04:20:12,060 --> 04:20:14,620
And I jumped off the map like a dafty.

3956
04:20:16,220 --> 04:20:17,100
OK, that's fine.

3957
04:20:18,940 --> 04:20:19,420
Ooh.

3958
04:20:20,860 --> 04:20:24,220
Oh, this is what I remember my dad doing all the time.

3959
04:20:24,220 --> 04:20:25,180
I think it was me.

3960
04:20:27,020 --> 04:20:27,500
Hold on.

3961
04:20:28,220 --> 04:20:29,020
I'll just fuck him up.

3962
04:20:29,900 --> 04:20:31,420
Look at the thing in the background.

3963
04:20:31,420 --> 04:20:36,380
I'd really rather not have infinitely spawning enemies.

3964
04:20:36,380 --> 04:20:37,420
I don't know about you guys,

3965
04:20:37,420 --> 04:20:41,420
but infinite spawning enemies is not my sound of fun.

3966
04:20:42,060 --> 04:20:43,100
My sound of fun?

3967
04:20:43,100 --> 04:20:45,980
Gee, I can hardly speak and play at the same time.

3968
04:20:45,980 --> 04:20:46,540
I'm so sorry.

3969
04:20:47,900 --> 04:20:50,940
I think my dad used to perfectly not destroy the buildings

3970
04:20:50,940 --> 04:20:53,260
so he could collect all these items and leave them there.

3971
04:20:53,260 --> 04:20:54,060
I'm actually sorry.

3972
04:20:54,060 --> 04:20:55,900
I'm legit calling him after my aim is done.

3973
04:20:56,940 --> 04:20:57,820
Because I need to know.

3974
04:20:58,620 --> 04:20:59,420
I think it's true.

3975
04:21:00,460 --> 04:21:01,580
Oh, come on.

3976
04:21:01,580 --> 04:21:02,300
I got you.

3977
04:21:02,300 --> 04:21:03,100
Bear in square.

3978
04:21:03,740 --> 04:21:04,220
Oh, shit.

3979
04:21:04,220 --> 04:21:04,860
I'm low health.

3980
04:21:07,820 --> 04:21:08,460
Hold on.

3981
04:21:08,460 --> 04:21:08,940
Hold on.

3982
04:21:10,140 --> 04:21:10,540
Hold on.

3983
04:21:10,540 --> 04:21:11,820
I'm getting my dad on the phone right now.

3984
04:21:11,820 --> 04:21:13,580
He fucking walks me through this damn game.

3985
04:21:13,580 --> 04:21:13,980
Hold on.

3986
04:21:13,980 --> 04:21:14,620
There must be like...

3987
04:21:15,900 --> 04:21:17,020
Oh, come on.

3988
04:21:17,020 --> 04:21:17,900
Not another one.

3989
04:21:18,860 --> 04:21:19,980
OK, I'll just talk about that.

3990
04:21:19,980 --> 04:21:22,700
Where are these freaking supply bases?

3991
04:21:23,020 --> 04:21:23,500
Hold on.

3992
04:21:24,220 --> 04:21:24,940
Yeah, yeah.

3993
04:21:24,940 --> 04:21:25,660
No, no, no.

3994
04:21:25,660 --> 04:21:27,180
Why did the fillet go up?

3995
04:21:27,180 --> 04:21:28,300
I don't know why it is up.

3996
04:21:28,300 --> 04:21:29,580
I don't know why it is up.

3997
04:21:29,580 --> 04:21:31,260
Right, I just tried that one last week.

3998
04:21:32,860 --> 04:21:33,340
Are you?

3999
04:21:34,700 --> 04:21:35,420
No, he's not.

4000
04:21:35,420 --> 04:21:36,540
It's not reloaded yet.

4001
04:21:38,860 --> 04:21:39,740
Can I get you first?

4002
04:21:41,100 --> 04:21:43,180
Whoa, I need to start doing that whole crap.

4003
04:21:43,180 --> 04:21:43,820
Please.

4004
04:21:44,620 --> 04:21:45,340
Aim.

4005
04:21:45,340 --> 04:21:45,820
Please.

4006
04:21:45,820 --> 04:21:46,700
I'm begging you.

4007
04:21:46,700 --> 04:21:47,020
Aim.

4008
04:21:47,980 --> 04:21:49,500
Why aren't you freaking going off?

4009
04:21:49,580 --> 04:21:50,220
Yeah.

4010
04:21:51,900 --> 04:21:52,860
Oh, come on.

4011
04:21:52,860 --> 04:21:53,260
Freak.

4012
04:21:55,100 --> 04:21:56,380
Oh, come on.

4013
04:21:57,740 --> 04:21:58,780
Please, I'm on my knees.

4014
04:22:02,380 --> 04:22:03,580
I was far too early on that.

4015
04:22:03,580 --> 04:22:04,060
That's fine.

4016
04:22:04,060 --> 04:22:04,860
I can pick up the goods.

4017
04:22:07,500 --> 04:22:07,900
Wah.

4018
04:22:11,100 --> 04:22:11,740
OK, here we go.

4019
04:22:12,380 --> 04:22:13,180
Here we go.

4020
04:22:13,180 --> 04:22:13,740
Where is he?

4021
04:22:14,300 --> 04:22:15,340
Oh, fuck, I missed him.

4022
04:22:15,340 --> 04:22:16,380
I don't know where the fuck he was.

4023
04:22:17,340 --> 04:22:18,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4024
04:22:18,460 --> 04:22:19,260
Oh, he's limping.

4025
04:22:19,260 --> 04:22:20,140
That's what we want to see.

4026
04:22:25,660 --> 04:22:26,700
Oh, thank goodness.

4027
04:22:29,020 --> 04:22:29,500
Crap.

4028
04:22:30,940 --> 04:22:32,620
I'm starting to feel the struggle.

4029
04:22:32,620 --> 04:22:34,620
I'm not sure how much confidence I've got.

4030
04:22:34,620 --> 04:22:35,660
I'm going to be honest.

4031
04:22:35,660 --> 04:22:36,540
I'm getting a bit nervous.

4032
04:22:36,540 --> 04:22:37,580
I'm getting a little shaky.

4033
04:22:37,580 --> 04:22:38,300
I'm getting nervous.

4034
04:22:39,340 --> 04:22:41,340
I'm going to grab this little guy over here.

4035
04:22:41,340 --> 04:22:42,060
Hail's bar.

4036
04:22:42,060 --> 04:22:42,780
I know.

4037
04:22:42,780 --> 04:22:43,260
I know.

4038
04:22:44,620 --> 04:22:46,140
Right, I can't grab that.

4039
04:22:46,140 --> 04:22:46,860
I got this.

4040
04:22:49,820 --> 04:22:50,940
Are these even possible?

4041
04:22:52,700 --> 04:22:54,700
I just destroyed my health bar for that.

4042
04:22:54,700 --> 04:22:55,260
Crap.

4043
04:22:55,260 --> 04:22:56,460
OK, OK, it's fine.

4044
04:22:56,460 --> 04:22:56,940
It's fine.

4045
04:22:57,980 --> 04:22:59,900
OK, I need to use my ultimate.

4046
04:22:59,900 --> 04:23:00,460
Holy crap.

4047
04:23:00,460 --> 04:23:02,300
It like respawns so quickly as well.

4048
04:23:03,900 --> 04:23:04,940
I'm still going to get to see you there.

4049
04:23:04,940 --> 04:23:05,340
Hold on.

4050
04:23:09,420 --> 04:23:10,940
OK, use my ultimate.

4051
04:23:10,940 --> 04:23:11,420
Wham.

4052
04:23:12,860 --> 04:23:13,420
Wham.

4053
04:23:14,140 --> 04:23:15,580
It's ultraviolet.

4054
04:23:16,620 --> 04:23:16,940
Whoa.

4055
04:23:17,900 --> 04:23:19,900
Please do not glitch out on the last mission.

4056
04:23:19,900 --> 04:23:20,700
I appreciate that.

4057
04:23:20,700 --> 04:23:21,260
I appreciate that.

4058
04:23:21,260 --> 04:23:22,220
I appreciate that.

4059
04:23:22,220 --> 04:23:22,460
Hold on.

4060
04:23:22,460 --> 04:23:23,420
I'm going to dream far.

4061
04:23:23,420 --> 04:23:24,940
Sir, Atlas inbound.

4062
04:23:24,940 --> 04:23:26,140
OK, OK, I can handle it.

4063
04:23:26,140 --> 04:23:26,860
Atlas is gone.

4064
04:23:26,860 --> 04:23:28,540
Let me just get the other things that are kind of

4065
04:23:28,540 --> 04:23:29,580
to plant me up with this.

4066
04:23:32,140 --> 04:23:32,860
Oh, here he comes.

4067
04:23:33,740 --> 04:23:35,100
Right, ultimate, ultimate.

4068
04:23:37,100 --> 04:23:37,580
OK.

4069
04:23:39,020 --> 04:23:41,020
Uh, how often?

4070
04:23:41,020 --> 04:23:41,420
OK.

4071
04:23:42,540 --> 04:23:44,140
Am I just kind of the mercenary?

4072
04:23:44,140 --> 04:23:45,420
I have a prolonged escape

4073
04:23:46,380 --> 04:23:47,180
to real life.

4074
04:23:47,180 --> 04:23:47,660
I am.

4075
04:23:47,660 --> 04:23:49,180
I'm happy to be the mercenary.

4076
04:23:49,180 --> 04:23:50,380
Hmm.

4077
04:23:50,380 --> 04:23:51,180
I don't like that.

4078
04:23:52,460 --> 04:23:53,580
OK, ultimate's ready.

4079
04:23:54,780 --> 04:23:55,580
Please.

4080
04:23:55,580 --> 04:23:56,700
OK, yay.

4081
04:23:56,700 --> 04:23:57,820
We hit nothing.

4082
04:23:57,820 --> 04:23:58,620
Let's go.

4083
04:23:58,620 --> 04:23:59,500
I love hitting nothing.

4084
04:24:00,620 --> 04:24:01,500
OK, he's on fire.

4085
04:24:01,500 --> 04:24:02,700
He's on fire.

4086
04:24:02,700 --> 04:24:04,700
I'm also in trouble equally, though.

4087
04:24:08,460 --> 04:24:10,780
Please drop pieces of health I beg of you.

4088
04:24:10,780 --> 04:24:12,780
Whoa, those rocks are also falling.

4089
04:24:13,740 --> 04:24:17,100
Let's destroy a few buildings while we're at it.

4090
04:24:21,420 --> 04:24:23,500
Yeah, I'm going to need the ability to see if there's going

4091
04:24:23,500 --> 04:24:25,260
to be more enemies about to spawn in.

4092
04:24:25,260 --> 04:24:26,940
I'm going to need the ability to see if this thing's

4093
04:24:26,940 --> 04:24:29,660
going to be great instead of, like, playing hide and go seek.

4094
04:24:31,740 --> 04:24:34,540
Zero aim assist on the health fire.

4095
04:24:34,780 --> 04:24:35,260
Yeah.

4096
04:24:42,220 --> 04:24:45,660
It's the field of view in this game is absolute.

4097
04:24:45,660 --> 04:24:47,260
Hey, it's all shadows.

4098
04:24:47,260 --> 04:24:48,940
I'm going to be fighting shadows right now.

4099
04:24:49,580 --> 04:24:50,380
Give me that.

4100
04:24:50,380 --> 04:24:51,180
Give me that.

4101
04:24:51,180 --> 04:24:52,220
As if I missed 20.

4102
04:24:52,220 --> 04:24:52,620
Hold on.

4103
04:24:56,300 --> 04:24:56,940
All right.

4104
04:24:56,940 --> 04:24:59,020
Let's hope there's some health on the route

4105
04:24:59,020 --> 04:25:00,540
because I'm sparking a little bit.

4106
04:25:00,540 --> 04:25:02,060
My little ankles are sparking.

4107
04:25:02,060 --> 04:25:03,740
It's just not a good sign at all.

4108
04:25:03,820 --> 04:25:06,540
You need to traverse these lava fields to get to the drill.

4109
04:25:06,540 --> 04:25:07,580
Yes, that's fine.

4110
04:25:09,340 --> 04:25:10,060
Who's that?

4111
04:25:10,060 --> 04:25:11,420
Oh, it's a mech.

4112
04:25:14,460 --> 04:25:17,180
OK, well, that was completely overheated for that,

4113
04:25:17,180 --> 04:25:18,060
not to get a look in.

4114
04:25:20,140 --> 04:25:21,420
Oh, god, there's two of them.

4115
04:25:22,380 --> 04:25:22,860
Sorry.

4116
04:25:22,860 --> 04:25:24,700
All you're going to hear in this is, um,

4117
04:25:25,340 --> 04:25:28,620
because I'm literally just spamming the button to activate it.

4118
04:25:28,620 --> 04:25:29,260
I'm so sorry.

4119
04:25:29,260 --> 04:25:34,380
I mean, it's working.

4120
04:25:35,260 --> 04:25:36,380
Oh, is he in the lava?

4121
04:25:40,380 --> 04:25:41,180
If you're right in front of me,

4122
04:25:41,180 --> 04:25:42,540
you're getting ultimated right now.

4123
04:25:43,980 --> 04:25:47,340
Oh, hey, that didn't quite work in the end, so that's OK.

4124
04:25:49,260 --> 04:25:49,980
Come on.

4125
04:25:49,980 --> 04:25:52,220
I'm so heavy.

4126
04:25:53,020 --> 04:25:54,460
I'm so hot.

4127
04:25:55,260 --> 04:25:57,260
The mech is like running on fire.

4128
04:25:59,260 --> 04:26:00,300
Bro, you aren't going to give up.

4129
04:26:04,460 --> 04:26:06,460
We'll get two health back from those two,

4130
04:26:06,460 --> 04:26:08,540
which should take me back to full health.

4131
04:26:08,540 --> 04:26:09,820
Oh, just under full health.

4132
04:26:12,300 --> 04:26:13,420
He's not going to lie.

4133
04:26:13,420 --> 04:26:15,980
I think that's how you're supposed to play this mech.

4134
04:26:15,980 --> 04:26:16,700
Just constantly.

4135
04:26:19,100 --> 04:26:21,020
Oh, wait, the lava plume.

4136
04:26:21,020 --> 04:26:22,940
I'm supposed to walk through the lava plume.

4137
04:26:24,220 --> 04:26:27,020
Is it possible to do it as little damage as possible?

4138
04:26:30,140 --> 04:26:32,540
OK, hold on.

4139
04:26:32,540 --> 04:26:32,940
Oh, no.

4140
04:26:36,060 --> 04:26:37,100
Oh, shit.

4141
04:26:37,100 --> 04:26:37,660
Oh, shit.

4142
04:26:37,660 --> 04:26:38,140
Oh, shit.

4143
04:26:38,140 --> 04:26:38,620
What have I done?

4144
04:26:44,140 --> 04:26:45,180
OK, OK, OK, it's fine.

4145
04:26:45,180 --> 04:26:48,380
It takes a hot second for it to actually register you're in lava,

4146
04:26:48,380 --> 04:26:50,780
which I'm quite glad about.

4147
04:26:52,620 --> 04:26:54,380
Wah, OK, that was a bit silly of me,

4148
04:26:54,380 --> 04:26:54,940
but we did it.

4149
04:26:54,940 --> 04:26:55,420
We did it.

4150
04:26:55,420 --> 04:26:56,300
We're fine.

4151
04:26:56,300 --> 04:26:56,780
Kind of.

4152
04:26:57,740 --> 04:26:59,020
We're fine.

4153
04:27:00,860 --> 04:27:01,660
OK, big one.

4154
04:27:02,540 --> 04:27:04,140
It might take a little bit of damage.

4155
04:27:05,340 --> 04:27:06,860
We better, we better, we better, we better.

4156
04:27:06,860 --> 04:27:07,420
Could have been worse.

4157
04:27:07,420 --> 04:27:08,060
Could have been worse.

4158
04:27:10,860 --> 04:27:11,340
OK.

4159
04:27:12,540 --> 04:27:12,860
OK.

4160
04:27:13,980 --> 04:27:15,580
OK, ultimate time, I guess.

4161
04:27:16,700 --> 04:27:17,900
Oh, completely missed.

4162
04:27:17,900 --> 04:27:18,540
No, I hit.

4163
04:27:19,340 --> 04:27:21,660
Wah, I hit, I hit, I hit.

4164
04:27:24,220 --> 04:27:26,620
Now, if this mech could just calm down a bit.

4165
04:27:27,260 --> 04:27:30,060
Whenever I hear something aiming at me.

4166
04:27:32,060 --> 04:27:34,060
The gate ahead will take you to the drill approach.

4167
04:27:34,060 --> 04:27:34,780
Hurry.

4168
04:27:34,780 --> 04:27:35,420
I see him.

4169
04:27:36,380 --> 04:27:36,860
I see him.

4170
04:27:37,500 --> 04:27:39,420
Oh, there's fucking Atlas as well.

4171
04:27:40,140 --> 04:27:40,940
Oh, shit.

4172
04:27:41,740 --> 04:27:42,620
Shit, shit, shit.

4173
04:27:42,620 --> 04:27:43,340
Do not like this.

4174
04:27:44,140 --> 04:27:44,860
Hold on.

4175
04:27:44,860 --> 04:27:46,380
I need to pick them off.

4176
04:27:46,380 --> 04:27:47,660
Oh, my God, I need to pick them off.

4177
04:27:48,300 --> 04:27:50,540
OK, Atlas has really low mobility,

4178
04:27:50,540 --> 04:27:52,300
which I'm going to use my damage.

4179
04:27:53,420 --> 04:27:54,940
One is taken down.

4180
04:27:55,020 --> 04:27:57,420
Maybe the Atlas can take some fucking damage.

4181
04:27:58,940 --> 04:28:00,220
OK, he's limping.

4182
04:28:00,220 --> 04:28:01,100
That's what I want to see.

4183
04:28:02,940 --> 04:28:03,740
That's what I want to see.

4184
04:28:03,740 --> 04:28:05,180
I want to see you limping, darling.

4185
04:28:05,180 --> 04:28:07,260
No, you want to limp for me, don't you?

4186
04:28:08,140 --> 04:28:08,860
Oh, yeah.

4187
04:28:09,900 --> 04:28:10,540
OK.

4188
04:28:10,540 --> 04:28:11,420
And then, ultimate.

4189
04:28:12,380 --> 04:28:13,260
And then, receive.

4190
04:28:14,140 --> 04:28:16,460
I'm going to spam you down until you're nothing.

4191
04:28:17,660 --> 04:28:18,620
OK, perfect.

4192
04:28:20,060 --> 04:28:20,620
Perfect.

4193
04:28:20,620 --> 04:28:22,780
I don't know if I can grab that.

4194
04:28:22,780 --> 04:28:25,260
I may be able to grab that with my invincibility shield.

4195
04:28:25,260 --> 04:28:25,980
Holy crap.

4196
04:28:26,780 --> 04:28:28,060
I think we're doing it.

4197
04:28:28,060 --> 04:28:29,420
I don't know what mission we're on.

4198
04:28:29,420 --> 04:28:30,940
I don't know if we're at the end of the game or not,

4199
04:28:30,940 --> 04:28:31,980
but I think we're doing it.

4200
04:28:33,020 --> 04:28:33,980
OK, perfect.

4201
04:28:33,980 --> 04:28:36,700
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.

4202
04:28:36,700 --> 04:28:37,500
Perfect.

4203
04:28:38,540 --> 04:28:40,460
Stony, leave me limping for real.

4204
04:28:40,460 --> 04:28:43,020
These fights are getting kind of heated.

4205
04:28:48,300 --> 04:28:50,300
Look, the map's covered in lava.

4206
04:28:50,300 --> 04:28:51,740
I'm overheating as a mech.

4207
04:28:51,740 --> 04:28:54,700
It's not a bad joke if you put two and two together.

4208
04:28:54,700 --> 04:28:55,180
Jeez.

4209
04:28:56,780 --> 04:28:58,540
These guys are terrible.

4210
04:28:58,540 --> 04:28:59,420
Whoa.

4211
04:28:59,420 --> 04:29:00,140
Next section.

4212
04:29:01,980 --> 04:29:03,580
Ready to rock number two.

4213
04:29:07,420 --> 04:29:07,660
Oh.

4214
04:29:09,260 --> 04:29:11,820
Sir, the trail isn't far down this path.

4215
04:29:11,820 --> 04:29:14,380
I am leading a number of large mechs defending it.

4216
04:29:14,380 --> 04:29:15,900
I wonder if they even know what they're guarding.

4217
04:29:16,540 --> 04:29:18,060
Captain, good luck.

4218
04:29:18,060 --> 04:29:19,100
We're depending on you.

4219
04:29:20,060 --> 04:29:22,700
Yeah, you keep saying the whole world is depending on my shoulders.

4220
04:29:22,700 --> 04:29:23,420
That's quite a lot.

4221
04:29:23,420 --> 04:29:24,220
I'm not going to lie.

4222
04:29:24,220 --> 04:29:25,980
Like, you know, not a lot gets to me,

4223
04:29:25,980 --> 04:29:27,820
but saying that the whole world depends on me,

4224
04:29:27,820 --> 04:29:29,500
like right now, right at this very second.

4225
04:29:29,500 --> 04:29:30,220
Yeah.

4226
04:29:30,220 --> 04:29:32,620
Sorry, I was just checking if there's like any secret behind me.

4227
04:29:33,580 --> 04:29:35,020
Stony, you always huggy here.

4228
04:29:38,780 --> 04:29:41,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4229
04:29:41,500 --> 04:29:41,740
Right.

4230
04:29:41,740 --> 04:29:42,380
OK, wait.

4231
04:29:42,380 --> 04:29:43,980
If they've given me eight minutes,

4232
04:29:43,980 --> 04:29:45,820
this round can be done in four.

4233
04:29:45,820 --> 04:29:46,540
I am OK.

4234
04:29:47,500 --> 04:29:48,300
Holy shit.

4235
04:29:48,300 --> 04:29:49,500
I'm getting obliterated.

4236
04:29:49,500 --> 04:29:50,300
I'm not the good thing.

4237
04:29:51,260 --> 04:29:52,540
Like, actually obliterated.

4238
04:29:53,420 --> 04:29:54,860
I've not even started.

4239
04:29:56,940 --> 04:29:57,500
Oh, my God.

4240
04:29:57,500 --> 04:29:59,580
And I'm so slow to turn around.

4241
04:30:00,460 --> 04:30:01,500
Oh, I got him though.

4242
04:30:02,460 --> 04:30:03,340
OK, I got him though.

4243
04:30:03,340 --> 04:30:03,980
I got him though.

4244
04:30:05,260 --> 04:30:05,740
Oh, my God.

4245
04:30:05,740 --> 04:30:05,980
Right.

4246
04:30:05,980 --> 04:30:07,820
It only takes four minutes to finish this mission.

4247
04:30:07,820 --> 04:30:08,860
That's how it works.

4248
04:30:08,860 --> 04:30:09,580
That's how it works.

4249
04:30:09,580 --> 04:30:10,380
It's four minutes.

4250
04:30:10,380 --> 04:30:11,020
That's all.

4251
04:30:11,020 --> 04:30:12,060
And I'm already over here.

4252
04:30:12,060 --> 04:30:12,620
That's safe.

4253
04:30:15,180 --> 04:30:15,980
Oh.

4254
04:30:15,980 --> 04:30:17,020
What am I supposed to do?

4255
04:30:19,980 --> 04:30:20,940
I don't know.

4256
04:30:20,940 --> 04:30:22,220
For a man.

4257
04:30:23,820 --> 04:30:24,380
Four minutes.

4258
04:30:24,380 --> 04:30:25,820
And I can't even get around the corner.

4259
04:30:26,940 --> 04:30:27,580
Four minutes.

4260
04:30:27,580 --> 04:30:29,180
I'm already lost the frickin' minute.

4261
04:30:30,220 --> 04:30:30,620
Please.

4262
04:30:31,740 --> 04:30:33,260
Video game work with me here.

4263
04:30:33,260 --> 04:30:33,900
Yeah, that's right.

4264
04:30:33,900 --> 04:30:34,380
You better be.

4265
04:30:35,420 --> 04:30:36,620
Yeah, you better give me real quick.

4266
04:30:37,180 --> 04:30:38,940
I don't know if I'm fucking good.

4267
04:30:38,940 --> 04:30:40,380
I'm sorry for grabbing this stuff.

4268
04:30:40,380 --> 04:30:41,740
But if they gave me eight minutes,

4269
04:30:41,740 --> 04:30:44,860
that means I have four minutes to fuck all the show.

4270
04:30:46,380 --> 04:30:47,180
Are we already here?

4271
04:30:49,580 --> 04:30:51,340
Or did I have eight minutes to come here?

4272
04:30:51,340 --> 04:30:52,140
Whoa.

4273
04:30:52,140 --> 04:30:53,340
You perished.

4274
04:30:53,340 --> 04:30:54,860
Am I supposed to perish you?

4275
04:30:54,860 --> 04:30:55,580
I feel like it.

4276
04:30:59,820 --> 04:31:01,900
Uh, what?

4277
04:31:02,860 --> 04:31:04,540
I just wasted everything on that ship.

4278
04:31:04,540 --> 04:31:05,900
And that wasn't even my target.

4279
04:31:08,060 --> 04:31:09,180
Please, Atlas.

4280
04:31:09,180 --> 04:31:10,060
Not now.

4281
04:31:10,060 --> 04:31:10,620
Please.

4282
04:31:11,660 --> 04:31:12,220
Surely.

4283
04:31:12,220 --> 04:31:13,580
Oh, I've actually fucked that

4284
04:31:13,580 --> 04:31:14,620
because I went for that ship.

4285
04:31:14,620 --> 04:31:16,700
And it wasn't even my target.

4286
04:31:16,700 --> 04:31:18,460
It wasn't my target.

4287
04:31:18,460 --> 04:31:20,380
I've actually pulled that up so badly.

4288
04:31:20,380 --> 04:31:20,700
Okay.

4289
04:31:20,700 --> 04:31:22,540
We'll need to restart because I messed that up.

4290
04:31:22,540 --> 04:31:23,180
But that's okay.

4291
04:31:23,180 --> 04:31:23,660
Oh.

4292
04:31:25,580 --> 04:31:26,140
Hello.

4293
04:31:33,820 --> 04:31:35,500
Oh, because I aimed at that ship.

4294
04:31:35,500 --> 04:31:36,780
I got annihilated.

4295
04:31:37,820 --> 04:31:38,300
Holy.

4296
04:31:39,900 --> 04:31:40,300
Hmm.

4297
04:31:41,580 --> 04:31:42,460
Holy moly.

4298
04:31:43,420 --> 04:31:44,060
Okay.

4299
04:31:44,060 --> 04:31:44,300
Okay.

4300
04:31:44,300 --> 04:31:44,620
Yes.

4301
04:31:44,620 --> 04:31:45,820
I understand.

4302
04:31:45,820 --> 04:31:47,180
The drill isn't far down this path.

4303
04:31:47,180 --> 04:31:47,420
Okay.

4304
04:31:47,420 --> 04:31:47,900
Right.

4305
04:31:47,900 --> 04:31:49,420
Let's go to the choppers first.

4306
04:31:49,420 --> 04:31:50,540
We know there's choppers ahead.

4307
04:31:52,540 --> 04:31:52,620
Okay.

4308
04:31:52,620 --> 04:31:53,260
Here they come.

4309
04:31:57,500 --> 04:32:00,140
I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do.

4310
04:32:00,140 --> 04:32:01,020
I'm going to be honest.

4311
04:32:02,540 --> 04:32:03,420
It's tough to rule.

4312
04:32:07,420 --> 04:32:07,900
Hold on.

4313
04:32:13,100 --> 04:32:14,700
Holy moly.

4314
04:32:16,700 --> 04:32:18,860
I'm wondering because of the environment as well.

4315
04:32:18,860 --> 04:32:19,340
Oops.

4316
04:32:19,340 --> 04:32:19,820
Sorry.

4317
04:32:19,820 --> 04:32:21,740
Oh, and I just damaged myself.

4318
04:32:21,740 --> 04:32:22,380
Lucky me.

4319
04:32:25,180 --> 04:32:29,100
Um, because obviously I'm just so good at that.

4320
04:32:29,100 --> 04:32:32,700
Uh, it's actually my best winning strategy in this game.

4321
04:32:33,980 --> 04:32:35,900
Let's see if my snipe is better than this one.

4322
04:32:38,540 --> 04:32:39,980
Tanks are going to come around the corner.

4323
04:32:39,980 --> 04:32:40,700
Okay.

4324
04:32:40,700 --> 04:32:41,740
We already know that.

4325
04:32:42,060 --> 04:32:43,100
Oh, one's down already.

4326
04:32:43,740 --> 04:32:43,980
Okay.

4327
04:32:43,980 --> 04:32:45,980
We're doing a much better run already.

4328
04:32:48,620 --> 04:32:50,700
I need to keep using my ultimates.

4329
04:32:51,980 --> 04:32:52,860
Give me full health.

4330
04:32:55,020 --> 04:32:56,380
Do not shoot at the ship.

4331
04:32:56,380 --> 04:32:58,540
The ship is not the objective.

4332
04:32:59,500 --> 04:33:01,580
Shabby and harem.

4333
04:33:02,940 --> 04:33:03,980
What the heck?

4334
04:33:03,980 --> 04:33:05,500
I was about to redirect it to you.

4335
04:33:06,780 --> 04:33:07,740
Don't be selfish, Shabby.

4336
04:33:07,740 --> 04:33:08,460
Get back online.

4337
04:33:10,140 --> 04:33:10,540
Right.

4338
04:33:10,620 --> 04:33:11,260
Okay.

4339
04:33:11,260 --> 04:33:11,980
Take a breather.

4340
04:33:13,020 --> 04:33:13,500
Let's go.

4341
04:33:14,620 --> 04:33:15,100
Let's go.

4342
04:33:16,460 --> 04:33:16,940
Let's go.

4343
04:33:19,180 --> 04:33:19,980
Okay.

4344
04:33:19,980 --> 04:33:21,100
Atlas is on fire.

4345
04:33:21,100 --> 04:33:21,660
I repeat.

4346
04:33:21,660 --> 04:33:22,780
Atlas is on fire.

4347
04:33:22,780 --> 04:33:23,740
That's what we want to see.

4348
04:33:23,740 --> 04:33:24,620
Atlas down first.

4349
04:33:24,620 --> 04:33:26,300
Atlas is the biggest issue.

4350
04:33:26,300 --> 04:33:26,940
Hi, harem.

4351
04:33:26,940 --> 04:33:28,140
We're playing mech assault.

4352
04:33:28,140 --> 04:33:29,900
It's not the easiest game.

4353
04:33:29,900 --> 04:33:31,020
It's a very old game.

4354
04:33:31,900 --> 04:33:33,180
Very much an older game.

4355
04:33:33,180 --> 04:33:35,420
I am doing absolutely dog ass right now.

4356
04:33:35,420 --> 04:33:35,980
Holy crap.

4357
04:33:35,980 --> 04:33:37,580
I'm messing this up so badly.

4358
04:33:37,580 --> 04:33:37,980
Right.

4359
04:33:37,980 --> 04:33:38,460
Got one.

4360
04:33:39,660 --> 04:33:40,300
We've got one.

4361
04:33:40,700 --> 04:33:41,660
We've got one.

4362
04:33:41,660 --> 04:33:42,460
We've got one.

4363
04:33:42,460 --> 04:33:43,340
That's all we need.

4364
04:33:43,980 --> 04:33:45,660
My Ragnarok flame is a fact.

4365
04:33:45,660 --> 04:33:46,220
That's fine.

4366
04:33:46,860 --> 04:33:50,300
The second Atlas is now fucking up my ass.

4367
04:33:51,340 --> 04:33:52,300
I'm not the good way.

4368
04:33:53,900 --> 04:33:56,060
I am using my ultimate so much.

4369
04:33:56,060 --> 04:33:56,780
I really am.

4370
04:33:56,780 --> 04:33:57,660
I'm trying my best.

4371
04:33:57,660 --> 04:33:58,540
I am darling.

4372
04:33:58,540 --> 04:33:59,500
So I'm trying my best.

4373
04:33:59,500 --> 04:33:59,980
Hi, harem.

4374
04:33:59,980 --> 04:34:01,100
Hi, Shabby.

4375
04:34:01,100 --> 04:34:01,980
What was the...

4376
04:34:01,980 --> 04:34:02,540
What was the...

4377
04:34:02,540 --> 04:34:05,500
On the agendination for the stream today for sheepsters?

4378
04:34:05,500 --> 04:34:06,860
Actually, there's underwear.

4379
04:34:07,660 --> 04:34:08,700
What one it could be.

4380
04:34:09,580 --> 04:34:11,180
Oh, forgive me for sake.

4381
04:34:11,180 --> 04:34:12,780
I'm going to get a couple ammo.

4382
04:34:12,780 --> 04:34:14,140
I'm going to need to pick this up.

4383
04:34:14,140 --> 04:34:15,980
This fucking Atlas with his real gun

4384
04:34:15,980 --> 04:34:17,660
is going for my cooter.

4385
04:34:18,300 --> 04:34:19,340
And not the good way.

4386
04:34:20,780 --> 04:34:21,020
Okay.

4387
04:34:21,020 --> 04:34:21,980
Let's get rid of him.

4388
04:34:21,980 --> 04:34:22,380
Whoa.

4389
04:34:22,380 --> 04:34:23,340
That's not Atlas.

4390
04:34:23,340 --> 04:34:24,460
It's a different floor.

4391
04:34:25,660 --> 04:34:26,140
Right.

4392
04:34:26,140 --> 04:34:26,620
Get you.

4393
04:34:28,380 --> 04:34:29,500
Can you take some damage?

4394
04:34:29,500 --> 04:34:31,180
That would be great if you could have taken some...

4395
04:34:31,180 --> 04:34:33,340
Like, honestly, don't be so selfish.

4396
04:34:33,340 --> 04:34:34,860
Take some freaking damage.

4397
04:34:34,860 --> 04:34:35,260
Hold on.

4398
04:34:35,900 --> 04:34:36,620
Oh, please hit.

4399
04:34:36,620 --> 04:34:37,180
Please hit.

4400
04:34:37,180 --> 04:34:37,420
Okay.

4401
04:34:37,420 --> 04:34:38,060
We've got two hits.

4402
04:34:38,060 --> 04:34:39,340
We've got two hits from our ultimate.

4403
04:34:39,340 --> 04:34:40,300
I'll take it.

4404
04:34:40,300 --> 04:34:41,100
He's on fire.

4405
04:34:41,100 --> 04:34:41,740
He's on fire.

4406
04:34:41,740 --> 04:34:42,940
That's all I need to see.

4407
04:34:42,940 --> 04:34:43,660
That's all I need to see.

4408
04:34:44,540 --> 04:34:44,940
No.

4409
04:34:44,940 --> 04:34:45,900
Sorry, mate.

4410
04:34:45,900 --> 04:34:46,700
I'm getting more and more.

4411
04:34:46,700 --> 04:34:47,100
Fuck you.

4412
04:34:48,300 --> 04:34:48,700
Get right.

4413
04:34:49,340 --> 04:34:49,740
Get right.

4414
04:34:50,380 --> 04:34:50,860
Get right.

4415
04:34:52,380 --> 04:34:52,940
He's limping.

4416
04:34:52,940 --> 04:34:53,580
He's limping.

4417
04:34:54,140 --> 04:34:54,380
Oh, yeah.

4418
04:34:54,380 --> 04:34:56,060
I'm going to pick up the stuff that dropped over here.

4419
04:35:00,140 --> 04:35:00,380
Okay.

4420
04:35:01,340 --> 04:35:01,820
Oh, shit.

4421
04:35:01,820 --> 04:35:02,140
Hold on.

4422
04:35:02,140 --> 04:35:03,740
There's like a few things on the map.

4423
04:35:03,740 --> 04:35:04,060
Hold on.

4424
04:35:04,060 --> 04:35:04,380
Hold on.

4425
04:35:04,380 --> 04:35:04,780
Hold on.

4426
04:35:04,780 --> 04:35:05,740
There's a few things on the map.

4427
04:35:05,740 --> 04:35:06,140
Hold on.

4428
04:35:08,540 --> 04:35:09,020
Hold on.

4429
04:35:09,020 --> 04:35:09,660
Give me a second.

4430
04:35:10,860 --> 04:35:12,540
You guys need to relax.

4431
04:35:12,540 --> 04:35:13,100
Relax.

4432
04:35:13,100 --> 04:35:13,580
Relax.

4433
04:35:14,940 --> 04:35:15,180
Wait.

4434
04:35:16,060 --> 04:35:17,180
Relax.

4435
04:35:17,180 --> 04:35:17,660
Oh, my God.

4436
04:35:17,660 --> 04:35:18,620
What's the problem?

4437
04:35:18,620 --> 04:35:20,060
I'm just trying to destroy everything.

4438
04:35:20,060 --> 04:35:21,580
What's the problem?

4439
04:35:21,580 --> 04:35:22,380
Sheesh.

4440
04:35:22,380 --> 04:35:23,420
You guys don't have any fun.

4441
04:35:25,420 --> 04:35:27,340
Are they infinitely respawned?

4442
04:35:27,340 --> 04:35:29,180
Or am I misappropriated?

4443
04:35:31,420 --> 04:35:32,060
Holy crap.

4444
04:35:32,060 --> 04:35:33,580
Are these guys infinite respawned?

4445
04:35:36,300 --> 04:35:37,500
She's falling for the bait.

4446
04:35:38,780 --> 04:35:39,660
Here's the drill.

4447
04:35:39,660 --> 04:35:41,900
The grunt spam is probably to waste time.

4448
04:35:42,460 --> 04:35:43,740
Fuck you, old bitch.

4449
04:35:43,740 --> 04:35:44,780
Fuck you, bitch.

4450
04:35:44,780 --> 04:35:45,500
Fuck you, booty.

4451
04:35:45,500 --> 04:35:46,140
Fuck you, bitch.

4452
04:35:55,020 --> 04:35:57,020
Am I supposed to sacrifice myself?

4453
04:35:57,020 --> 04:35:58,860
I actually don't remember how this game ends.

4454
04:36:03,500 --> 04:36:04,620
Uh, I'll listen.

4455
04:36:05,580 --> 04:36:06,220
Self-destruct.

4456
04:36:06,220 --> 04:36:09,020
You must confirm triggering the self-destruct sequence

4457
04:36:09,020 --> 04:36:10,220
in order to blow up the drill.

4458
04:36:10,220 --> 04:36:11,820
Press the A button to self-destruct.

4459
04:36:18,780 --> 04:36:20,140
Am I going to get a cutscene?

4460
04:36:20,700 --> 04:36:21,980
That was so chaotic.

4461
04:36:24,060 --> 04:36:25,660
Okay, I sacrifice myself.

4462
04:36:25,660 --> 04:36:25,980
Okay.

4463
04:36:30,220 --> 04:36:32,060
Wait, we save all of humanity in the door.

4464
04:36:32,060 --> 04:36:32,780
You can get this.

4465
04:36:32,780 --> 04:36:33,820
Wait, did that survive?

4466
04:36:37,180 --> 04:36:39,100
The drilling device is going critical.

4467
04:36:39,100 --> 04:36:39,980
Keep in it.

4468
04:36:41,420 --> 04:36:42,700
Any chance our boy made it?

4469
04:36:44,140 --> 04:36:44,620
Unknown.

4470
04:36:46,780 --> 04:36:48,380
There's a secret escape pod?

4471
04:36:49,660 --> 04:36:51,820
Hey, Tiger, you're finally awake.

4472
04:36:51,820 --> 04:36:52,460
Oh, right.

4473
04:36:52,460 --> 04:36:53,980
So Lieutenant Foster and the Tex

4474
04:36:53,980 --> 04:36:55,420
have been looking at your little toy.

4475
04:36:56,220 --> 04:36:58,140
We thought you were taking the dirt nap for sure.

4476
04:36:58,700 --> 04:36:59,500
Nice trick.

4477
04:36:59,500 --> 04:36:59,980
Sirs?

4478
04:36:59,980 --> 04:37:01,820
Your cockpit carried you out of that inferno

4479
04:37:01,820 --> 04:37:03,660
and straight back to our loving arms.

4480
04:37:04,220 --> 04:37:04,620
Sirs?

4481
04:37:05,340 --> 04:37:06,860
You really need to see this.

4482
04:37:06,860 --> 04:37:07,260
Oh, no.

4483
04:37:07,820 --> 04:37:09,900
This is technology that we have never seen.

4484
04:37:10,460 --> 04:37:11,660
And this is just the start.

4485
04:37:12,300 --> 04:37:14,460
We're not sure yet what all it can do,

4486
04:37:14,460 --> 04:37:15,420
but it saved your life.

4487
04:37:16,300 --> 04:37:17,100
I wonder if the enemy...

4488
04:37:21,660 --> 04:37:23,100
We handed it to the word,

4489
04:37:23,100 --> 04:37:24,220
saved everyone's butt,

4490
04:37:24,220 --> 04:37:26,380
and in the process definitely got the prize.

4491
04:37:27,100 --> 04:37:28,460
The other Dragoons are still down there

4492
04:37:28,460 --> 04:37:30,540
mopping up the remaining fanatics.

4493
04:37:30,540 --> 04:37:31,980
Most of them started running after you,

4494
04:37:31,980 --> 04:37:33,180
86, their commander.

4495
04:37:34,140 --> 04:37:35,420
We beat them on this planet,

4496
04:37:35,420 --> 04:37:37,260
but I have a feeling this war is just beginning.

4497
04:37:37,980 --> 04:37:39,660
The problem is a lot of them got away

4498
04:37:39,660 --> 04:37:41,100
and they'll spread like a virus.

4499
04:37:41,980 --> 04:37:43,340
So congratulations.

4500
04:37:43,340 --> 04:37:44,540
We've earned our pay

4501
04:37:44,540 --> 04:37:45,500
and a permanent place

4502
04:37:45,500 --> 04:37:46,620
on the word of Blake to the list.

4503
04:37:46,620 --> 04:37:47,580
Yay, the framerate's fucking dying.

4504
04:37:47,580 --> 04:37:48,860
They'll be coming for us.

4505
04:37:48,860 --> 04:37:50,940
And I'm damned if I'm going to give them your toy back.

4506
04:37:51,500 --> 04:37:53,900
Question is, are you ready for this sport?

4507
04:37:54,460 --> 04:37:55,820
Sure.

4508
04:37:55,820 --> 04:37:56,620
I'm ready.

4509
04:38:00,620 --> 04:38:01,580
We did it.

4510
04:38:02,380 --> 04:38:04,780
And the video game journalist lied.

4511
04:38:04,780 --> 04:38:05,420
This game...

4512
04:38:05,420 --> 04:38:06,140
Oh, sorry.

4513
04:38:06,700 --> 04:38:07,180
Hold on.

4514
04:38:07,180 --> 04:38:09,180
My Xbox's dust issue.

4515
04:38:09,180 --> 04:38:09,660
Hold on.

4516
04:38:10,700 --> 04:38:11,660
Oh, my God.

4517
04:38:12,300 --> 04:38:13,500
What the heck just happened?

4518
04:38:15,740 --> 04:38:16,860
Jeez, Louise.

4519
04:38:17,740 --> 04:38:18,300
Oh, yeah.

4520
04:38:18,300 --> 04:38:18,620
Sorry.

4521
04:38:18,620 --> 04:38:21,660
The dust is really building up.

4522
04:38:21,660 --> 04:38:22,300
Holy crap.

4523
04:38:22,300 --> 04:38:23,180
We actually did it.

4524
04:38:23,180 --> 04:38:23,820
I'm so surprised.

4525
04:38:23,820 --> 04:38:25,660
I better just play that game.

4526
04:38:25,660 --> 04:38:26,140
Hi.

4527
04:38:27,420 --> 04:38:28,860
Hi, I'm Strawny.

4528
04:38:28,860 --> 04:38:30,620
I don't even have a chat in slide.

4529
04:38:30,620 --> 04:38:31,100
Hold on.

4530
04:38:32,460 --> 04:38:32,700
Nope.

4531
04:38:32,700 --> 04:38:33,420
That's just...

4532
04:38:33,420 --> 04:38:34,460
That's just my...

4533
04:38:36,620 --> 04:38:38,700
Where the heck am I supposed to be on this?

4534
04:38:39,980 --> 04:38:40,860
This?

4535
04:38:40,860 --> 04:38:42,140
Oh, I'm hiding.

4536
04:38:42,140 --> 04:38:42,940
Oh, okay.

4537
04:38:42,940 --> 04:38:43,980
Hi.

4538
04:38:43,980 --> 04:38:45,980
Oh, let me turn off reactive model.

4539
04:38:45,980 --> 04:38:46,700
We did it.

4540
04:38:47,740 --> 04:38:48,540
I said, let me...

4541
04:38:48,540 --> 04:38:49,660
Is that reactive model?

4542
04:38:49,660 --> 04:38:51,180
Is that how bright I normally am?

4543
04:38:51,180 --> 04:38:52,300
Jeez, that's so bright.

4544
04:38:53,260 --> 04:38:54,780
Hi.

4545
04:38:54,780 --> 04:38:55,900
Hi, Hirom.

4546
04:38:56,940 --> 04:38:58,780
Thank you for joining.

4547
04:38:58,780 --> 04:38:59,820
And thank you, Sheepsters,

4548
04:38:59,900 --> 04:39:01,900
for redirecting into me.

4549
04:39:01,900 --> 04:39:03,180
Wait, are you straining?

4550
04:39:03,180 --> 04:39:04,220
The cold fish?

4551
04:39:04,220 --> 04:39:04,860
Heck, yeah.

4552
04:39:07,980 --> 04:39:10,220
I don't know if you can hear my little background music

4553
04:39:10,220 --> 04:39:11,180
should be in right now.

4554
04:39:11,740 --> 04:39:13,420
But we freaking did it.

4555
04:39:13,420 --> 04:39:15,020
I didn't realize Sheepy was gonna finish,

4556
04:39:15,020 --> 04:39:15,420
to be honest.

4557
04:39:15,420 --> 04:39:16,940
I was gonna redirect into her,

4558
04:39:16,940 --> 04:39:18,700
but I don't know if anyone else was coming on.

4559
04:39:23,260 --> 04:39:24,300
Where is it?

4560
04:39:27,340 --> 04:39:29,580
Is there anyone alive at all?

4561
04:39:30,300 --> 04:39:31,580
Will you play the second game?

4562
04:39:31,580 --> 04:39:33,580
I didn't even know there was a second game.

4563
04:39:33,580 --> 04:39:34,780
Oh, Mamosa.

4564
04:39:34,780 --> 04:39:35,420
Yes, okay.

4565
04:39:35,420 --> 04:39:37,180
I can happily redirect into Mosa.

4566
04:39:38,060 --> 04:39:38,380
Right.

4567
04:39:39,260 --> 04:39:40,060
Just so you know,

4568
04:39:41,180 --> 04:39:44,140
I'm going to do my membership ASMR stream early,

4569
04:39:44,140 --> 04:39:46,940
because I genuinely thought it was gonna take

4570
04:39:46,940 --> 04:39:49,180
like a couple billion hours to do this.

4571
04:39:49,820 --> 04:39:52,540
And every single Veloer model has so much detail.

4572
04:39:52,540 --> 04:39:54,460
I don't even think the girls know this.

4573
04:39:54,460 --> 04:39:56,620
Oh, well, I spent a pretty penny.

4574
04:39:56,620 --> 04:39:57,500
Yeah, but we're like,

4575
04:39:57,660 --> 04:39:59,340
your models look like shit.

4576
04:39:59,340 --> 04:40:00,780
And it's like, try again.

4577
04:40:00,780 --> 04:40:01,660
Good luck with that, mate.

4578
04:40:01,660 --> 04:40:02,140
Good luck.

4579
04:40:03,340 --> 04:40:04,700
Like, I'm sorry,

4580
04:40:04,700 --> 04:40:06,460
but we got designed out the wazoo.

4581
04:40:07,500 --> 04:40:08,780
And starting remember,

4582
04:40:08,780 --> 04:40:09,980
you have a bedroom scene.

4583
04:40:09,980 --> 04:40:10,700
I forget.

4584
04:40:10,700 --> 04:40:12,620
Oh, somewhere.

4585
04:40:12,620 --> 04:40:14,700
Yeah, I'll set up for the ASMR.

4586
04:40:15,660 --> 04:40:19,340
Um, I didn't know Mekosal even had a second game.

4587
04:40:19,340 --> 04:40:20,860
I don't even think my dad played it.

4588
04:40:20,860 --> 04:40:21,900
Hold on a minute.

4589
04:40:22,780 --> 04:40:23,900
Your phone, I'm gonna be like,

4590
04:40:23,900 --> 04:40:26,300
dad, do you recommend the Mekosal 2 game?

4591
04:40:26,300 --> 04:40:28,060
And he'll be like, why, Strony?

4592
04:40:28,060 --> 04:40:31,340
And I'll be like, I may or may not have played it on stream,

4593
04:40:31,340 --> 04:40:32,380
the first one anyway.

4594
04:40:33,420 --> 04:40:35,580
Um, oh, I didn't know.

4595
04:40:36,220 --> 04:40:38,700
It has spectacular lighting.

4596
04:40:38,700 --> 04:40:40,380
Yeah, oh, your phone.

4597
04:40:43,020 --> 04:40:44,460
And the start in street.

4598
04:40:44,460 --> 04:40:46,700
Oh, you guys haven't even seen my singers.

4599
04:40:46,700 --> 04:40:50,220
I don't even have my singers that are like activated.

4600
04:40:51,100 --> 04:40:52,220
I don't even use it.

4601
04:40:52,220 --> 04:40:54,620
The dad, and dad will watch the whole vlog.

4602
04:40:54,620 --> 04:40:57,420
Honestly, he'll start giggling if I send him the link to that.

4603
04:40:58,140 --> 04:41:00,860
Um, but he's busy with work,

4604
04:41:00,860 --> 04:41:02,540
which is why I'm trying to get him retired,

4605
04:41:02,540 --> 04:41:05,260
because I don't want him to like work himself

4606
04:41:05,260 --> 04:41:07,180
until a heart attack or something like that.

4607
04:41:08,140 --> 04:41:09,260
Does dad play anything?

4608
04:41:09,580 --> 04:41:13,340
Um, I would say no.

4609
04:41:13,340 --> 04:41:16,460
However, when he comes over,

4610
04:41:16,460 --> 04:41:18,700
I'm gonna download Halo Wars for him,

4611
04:41:18,700 --> 04:41:19,980
and he can play Mekosal.

4612
04:41:19,980 --> 04:41:22,940
I'll keep this installed if he wants to play it.

4613
04:41:23,580 --> 04:41:27,900
Um, dad gaming channel when?

4614
04:41:27,900 --> 04:41:30,780
Are you more interested in my dad gaming than me?

4615
04:41:32,620 --> 04:41:34,300
Strontium Games.

4616
04:41:34,300 --> 04:41:37,900
Call the channel Strontium Plays Games or something like that.

4617
04:41:39,100 --> 04:41:41,020
Quick, donate to the dad retirement fund.

4618
04:41:41,020 --> 04:41:41,820
No, no, no, no.

4619
04:41:41,820 --> 04:41:42,700
Let me earn it.

4620
04:41:42,700 --> 04:41:43,580
Let me work for it.

4621
04:41:43,580 --> 04:41:44,940
Let me upload ASMR.

4622
04:41:44,940 --> 04:41:47,020
Let me do an exchange for goods and money.

4623
04:41:47,020 --> 04:41:47,900
Let me do that, okay?

4624
04:41:49,020 --> 04:41:51,260
Hey, you should do Halo Co-op.

4625
04:41:51,260 --> 04:41:52,140
I think we will.

4626
04:41:52,940 --> 04:41:53,820
I think we will.

4627
04:41:53,820 --> 04:41:55,820
I'm like, I don't know how much patience

4628
04:41:55,820 --> 04:41:57,660
and how long he'll play it for,

4629
04:41:57,660 --> 04:42:02,860
and the problem is if I ask him questions during the game,

4630
04:42:02,860 --> 04:42:04,540
he's probably gonna be like,

4631
04:42:05,580 --> 04:42:08,060
Shawnee, shut the fuck up and try to play the game.

4632
04:42:09,500 --> 04:42:10,460
He'll probably be like,

4633
04:42:10,460 --> 04:42:12,620
wait, you talk and play through the game the entire time.

4634
04:42:12,620 --> 04:42:15,260
I'm like, yeah, that's how it works when you stream.

4635
04:42:15,260 --> 04:42:17,660
You can either talk to chat

4636
04:42:17,660 --> 04:42:19,020
and like respond to what they're saying.

4637
04:42:19,020 --> 04:42:20,700
You can commentate the game.

4638
04:42:20,700 --> 04:42:23,260
You can go on a tangent and that kind of thing.

4639
04:42:23,260 --> 04:42:25,100
But he'll be like, look, I'm here trying

4640
04:42:25,100 --> 04:42:27,260
to like defeat the covenant, like shut up, Shawnee.

4641
04:42:27,260 --> 04:42:28,540
And I'll be like, okay, thanks, dad.

4642
04:42:28,540 --> 04:42:29,820
Okay, I'll try my best.

4643
04:42:30,700 --> 04:42:33,820
That's my only thing if I did try and do Co-op with my dad.

4644
04:42:35,740 --> 04:42:37,020
But maybe I could record it

4645
04:42:37,020 --> 04:42:39,980
and like put it into like a funny highlight video instead.

4646
04:42:39,980 --> 04:42:43,820
Because I was gonna do like my dad guesses VTuber names

4647
04:42:45,100 --> 04:42:48,380
or my dad renames VTubers for the heck of it.

4648
04:42:49,100 --> 04:42:52,700
Cause if you thought Fondle of Boozom was bad,

4649
04:42:52,700 --> 04:42:57,340
my dad's gonna start naming VTubers like after Celtic players

4650
04:42:57,340 --> 04:42:59,980
and be like, oh, that's Nakamura.

4651
04:42:59,980 --> 04:43:04,540
Oh, that's, is it John Elton was the manager?

4652
04:43:04,540 --> 04:43:07,980
Someone called John dad and dad, dad names Jen too.

4653
04:43:09,420 --> 04:43:11,580
Honestly, that'd be funny.

4654
04:43:12,540 --> 04:43:13,660
He plays the game.

4655
04:43:13,660 --> 04:43:15,020
I commentate over it.

4656
04:43:15,020 --> 04:43:17,500
Oh, possibly that would work out.

4657
04:43:18,460 --> 04:43:21,660
Um, would he call Azura tits McGee?

4658
04:43:21,660 --> 04:43:22,940
Oh, absolutely.

4659
04:43:22,940 --> 04:43:25,580
He, my dad is like absolutely hilarious.

4660
04:43:25,580 --> 04:43:28,620
Like one time we went into the Co-op together

4661
04:43:28,620 --> 04:43:32,060
and they sell these like frog cakes and he gasped

4662
04:43:32,060 --> 04:43:35,180
and he went, oh, Shawnee, it's Peppy.

4663
04:43:36,060 --> 04:43:37,260
Like Peppy the frog.

4664
04:43:38,940 --> 04:43:41,900
Is it true your dad is a fucking slime VTuber?

4665
04:43:41,900 --> 04:43:46,220
No, Shawnee on stream would have 30 second delays

4666
04:43:46,220 --> 04:43:47,580
so that Shawnee can censor it.

4667
04:43:47,980 --> 04:43:51,020
Oh, honestly, I'm like, my name is Shawnee.

4668
04:43:52,380 --> 04:43:54,700
Shawnee is not helping chat when he's being on stream.

4669
04:43:54,700 --> 04:43:55,260
My mom.

4670
04:43:58,460 --> 04:44:01,660
But yes, John Elton right now.

4671
04:44:03,180 --> 04:44:06,060
The manager that used to be for Celtic.

4672
04:44:06,060 --> 04:44:07,020
Oh, Jock Steen.

4673
04:44:07,020 --> 04:44:08,700
Sorry, not John Elton.

4674
04:44:08,700 --> 04:44:12,060
I don't, as Jock Steen was a previous manager at Celtic.

4675
04:44:13,260 --> 04:44:15,260
We need him to operate a Cyclist VTuber.

4676
04:44:15,260 --> 04:44:18,220
I think he'd rather stab himself in the Cyclops eye

4677
04:44:18,220 --> 04:44:19,980
than become a Cyclops VTuber.

4678
04:44:20,860 --> 04:44:22,460
Peppy the frog is my religion.

4679
04:44:23,100 --> 04:44:27,980
My favorite animal is Peppy the frog.

4680
04:44:29,500 --> 04:44:33,420
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, yes, yes.

4681
04:44:33,420 --> 04:44:34,860
I bet your dad would like a slime.

4682
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:35,580
You know what?

4683
04:44:36,380 --> 04:44:37,260
I'll ask him.

4684
04:44:37,260 --> 04:44:39,820
I'll, when, when he gets here,

4685
04:44:39,820 --> 04:44:43,020
I'll show him a picture of the gen two concepts

4686
04:44:43,020 --> 04:44:45,980
and I'll stick a slime girl in between one of them

4687
04:44:45,980 --> 04:44:49,100
and I'll get him to rate them one out of 10.

4688
04:44:49,100 --> 04:44:52,060
And I bet you he'll agree with me and I'll be like, that looks,

4689
04:44:52,060 --> 04:44:55,580
he'll be like, that looks like piss but colored blue.

4690
04:44:55,580 --> 04:44:56,700
That's what he's gonna say.

4691
04:44:58,460 --> 04:45:00,620
He's gonna forget Shawnee the second, the stream blue.

4692
04:45:00,620 --> 04:45:02,460
I know that's why we're not, we're not doing live.

4693
04:45:02,460 --> 04:45:03,340
No chance.

4694
04:45:03,340 --> 04:45:05,420
Shawnee and dad ain't, ain't coming live.

4695
04:45:07,020 --> 04:45:09,500
If he says yes to slime, there has to be one.

4696
04:45:09,500 --> 04:45:10,940
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

4697
04:45:11,660 --> 04:45:16,220
If the slime girl outranks any veal or concept that we have,

4698
04:45:16,860 --> 04:45:19,100
I will give someone a slime toggle.

4699
04:45:19,100 --> 04:45:19,740
How about that?

4700
04:45:22,060 --> 04:45:25,420
You can tell she be chatting here with the slime girl propaganda.

4701
04:45:25,420 --> 04:45:27,740
Honestly, your propaganda is useless.

4702
04:45:29,660 --> 04:45:31,500
Not all slime girls are blue.

4703
04:45:31,500 --> 04:45:33,580
What, you want, oh, so you don't even want

4704
04:45:33,580 --> 04:45:35,980
the traditional blue slime girl.

4705
04:45:35,980 --> 04:45:39,740
It has to be an alternative color of slime girl on top.

4706
04:45:39,740 --> 04:45:42,300
Wow, I see your priorities.

4707
04:45:42,300 --> 04:45:43,820
I see your priorities.

4708
04:45:43,820 --> 04:45:44,940
Shocking behavior.

4709
04:45:45,660 --> 04:45:47,660
Shocking, honestly.

4710
04:45:49,740 --> 04:45:50,700
Paint, purple.

4711
04:45:50,700 --> 04:45:52,220
You want a purple slime girl?

4712
04:45:53,500 --> 04:45:53,820
No.

4713
04:45:54,860 --> 04:45:56,620
Shawnee is immune to boob again though.

4714
04:45:57,420 --> 04:45:58,940
Shimmering orange.

4715
04:45:58,940 --> 04:46:00,300
Shimmering orange.

4716
04:46:01,100 --> 04:46:03,980
What, so she's fucking neon pea color.

4717
04:46:03,980 --> 04:46:06,780
Orange, tangerine slime girl.

4718
04:46:06,780 --> 04:46:08,860
I'll call her, I'll call her tango

4719
04:46:08,860 --> 04:46:10,140
because she's tangerine.

4720
04:46:10,140 --> 04:46:10,700
Why not?

4721
04:46:10,700 --> 04:46:12,220
White slime girl, all right, you're done.

4722
04:46:12,220 --> 04:46:13,500
You're done, mods, get that man.

4723
04:46:14,140 --> 04:46:15,820
Jump on, jump on mods.

4724
04:46:17,260 --> 04:46:18,620
Slime girl is the lowest tier.

4725
04:46:18,620 --> 04:46:20,140
It's like McDonald's of slime girls.

4726
04:46:20,140 --> 04:46:22,860
I have to admit, I agree with that sentiment.

4727
04:46:24,140 --> 04:46:25,740
I agree, I agree.

4728
04:46:25,740 --> 04:46:29,740
Nuclear yellow, white jar slime girl.

4729
04:46:29,740 --> 04:46:31,900
You're done, you're getting timed out as well, right?

4730
04:46:31,900 --> 04:46:32,780
You're all getting timed out.

4731
04:46:33,580 --> 04:46:35,580
If your pea is orange, you need to go to a doctor.

4732
04:46:35,580 --> 04:46:36,780
Are you squirming me right now?

4733
04:46:37,340 --> 04:46:38,620
I swear if you're asking for slime.

4734
04:46:38,620 --> 04:46:39,820
I'll take that BT.

4735
04:46:41,020 --> 04:46:42,220
Yeah, good luck.

4736
04:46:42,220 --> 04:46:44,860
Thank you for the tip, Rilke Cadmus.

4737
04:46:44,860 --> 04:46:46,940
You take that bit because I know for a fact

4738
04:46:46,940 --> 04:46:48,300
my dad couldn't give less of a,

4739
04:46:49,580 --> 04:46:50,540
about slime girls.

4740
04:46:51,100 --> 04:46:54,780
He, in a lineup of Gen 1's designs,

4741
04:46:55,420 --> 04:46:58,300
I already know he's gonna like she be the most

4742
04:46:58,300 --> 04:46:59,820
because they, because they're blonde.

4743
04:47:00,860 --> 04:47:04,060
I do know her, her chest is out.

4744
04:47:07,020 --> 04:47:13,900
It'll be she be he likes first, then Azura,

4745
04:47:13,900 --> 04:47:17,420
then Mercy, then Icey, then Amylast.

4746
04:47:18,220 --> 04:47:19,100
I can already tell.

4747
04:47:19,820 --> 04:47:21,500
I can already tell.

4748
04:47:23,340 --> 04:47:25,900
He's gonna be scared of the lollipops

4749
04:47:25,900 --> 04:47:28,060
because he doesn't consume anime.

4750
04:47:29,100 --> 04:47:31,740
If you don't consume anime or like any of that content,

4751
04:47:31,740 --> 04:47:34,140
it can be a bit startling seeing lollipops.

4752
04:47:36,860 --> 04:47:38,940
ASMR, Amy turns Strony into a slime girl.

4753
04:47:38,940 --> 04:47:39,660
I believe her.

4754
04:47:39,660 --> 04:47:40,460
Honestly.

4755
04:47:44,140 --> 04:47:47,580
Yeah, my, this man likes them big.

4756
04:47:47,580 --> 04:47:49,500
Yeah, he's definitely like,

4757
04:47:52,380 --> 04:47:53,900
he's not gonna be interested in,

4758
04:47:53,900 --> 04:47:56,620
I am not getting my dad to rate my beach ever model.

4759
04:47:56,620 --> 04:47:59,260
That seems a bit, other than like, I'll tell,

4760
04:47:59,260 --> 04:48:01,420
like he already knows that I'm Strony,

4761
04:48:01,420 --> 04:48:03,100
like after and such thing.

4762
04:48:03,980 --> 04:48:08,060
Understood, but we are in anime world.

4763
04:48:08,060 --> 04:48:09,740
Lollipop covered slime girl.

4764
04:48:09,740 --> 04:48:10,460
You know what?

4765
04:48:12,220 --> 04:48:12,940
You know what?

4766
04:48:12,940 --> 04:48:14,620
If I look back and chat one more time

4767
04:48:14,620 --> 04:48:15,660
and see the S word,

4768
04:48:18,060 --> 04:48:20,780
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going scorched earth.

4769
04:48:20,780 --> 04:48:21,660
I'm going nuclear.

4770
04:48:21,660 --> 04:48:22,700
Do I make myself clear?

4771
04:48:24,940 --> 04:48:26,540
So I'm not looking at chat right now.

4772
04:48:26,540 --> 04:48:28,380
I'm getting ready to redirect into mimosa

4773
04:48:28,380 --> 04:48:31,100
because she's about to reach the watch time.

4774
04:48:31,100 --> 04:48:33,260
So please do consider watching her.

4775
04:48:34,060 --> 04:48:36,380
I am going to take a five minute break

4776
04:48:36,380 --> 04:48:37,660
and then we are going to boot up.

4777
04:48:40,700 --> 04:48:41,500
I like them.

4778
04:48:44,220 --> 04:48:45,180
Scorched earth.

4779
04:48:46,220 --> 04:48:50,540
Scorched earth is a saying where,

4780
04:48:51,500 --> 04:48:52,380
you know what?

4781
04:48:52,380 --> 04:48:53,660
We're in the information age.

4782
04:48:53,660 --> 04:48:56,780
Scorched earth meaning, let's search it.

4783
04:48:57,740 --> 04:49:01,180
Scorched earth.

4784
04:49:01,180 --> 04:49:03,500
Used to describe a military policy

4785
04:49:03,500 --> 04:49:06,220
in which all houses, crops, factories

4786
04:49:06,220 --> 04:49:07,420
in the area are destroyed

4787
04:49:07,420 --> 04:49:09,740
so that the enemy cannot utilize them.

4788
04:49:11,580 --> 04:49:13,020
And in layman's terms,

4789
04:49:13,020 --> 04:49:16,300
scorched earth means that you're all in trouble

4790
04:49:16,300 --> 04:49:17,660
if I read slime one more time.

4791
04:49:19,100 --> 04:49:22,140
I don't know why you guys are like so interested in slime.

4792
04:49:22,140 --> 04:49:23,020
It's not.

4793
04:49:23,020 --> 04:49:24,380
Why are you, why?

4794
04:49:24,380 --> 04:49:24,780
Why?

4795
04:49:25,580 --> 04:49:27,420
It's not going to work in each of her.

4796
04:49:36,140 --> 04:49:37,260
Yeah, that's scorched.

4797
04:49:37,260 --> 04:49:38,140
What's scratched?

4798
04:49:38,140 --> 04:49:39,180
Oh, did I say it wrong?

4799
04:49:39,180 --> 04:49:40,620
Did I say scratched earth?

4800
04:49:42,460 --> 04:49:43,820
Scratch my arse earth.

4801
04:49:43,820 --> 04:49:45,260
I'll scratch the earth's arse.

4802
04:49:45,260 --> 04:49:46,700
Stronium will burn viola to the ground

4803
04:49:46,700 --> 04:49:48,220
before having a slime grow.

4804
04:49:48,220 --> 04:49:50,620
Now, if one of the girls wants a slime toggle,

4805
04:49:50,620 --> 04:49:53,180
sure, knock yourself out just to upset me.

4806
04:49:53,180 --> 04:49:54,380
I don't care if they want that.

4807
04:49:54,780 --> 04:49:55,820
They can get it.

4808
04:49:55,820 --> 04:49:56,380
They want it.

4809
04:49:56,380 --> 04:49:56,940
They could get it.

4810
04:49:56,940 --> 04:49:59,340
I'm not stopping them from any goals like that.

4811
04:49:59,340 --> 04:50:02,780
But if you are asking me for a straight up slime girl,

4812
04:50:02,780 --> 04:50:09,180
default outfit, default position, no, I don't care.

4813
04:50:09,740 --> 04:50:10,460
I don't care.

4814
04:50:11,340 --> 04:50:14,220
So any muscle mummy concepts, that's called leaks.

4815
04:50:14,220 --> 04:50:15,500
I'm not allowed to leak that yet.

4816
04:50:17,420 --> 04:50:20,460
All I can say is that there's been progress

4817
04:50:21,660 --> 04:50:22,540
behind the scenes.

4818
04:50:23,260 --> 04:50:24,060
That's all I can say.

4819
04:50:24,060 --> 04:50:24,940
I'm not saying nothing more.

4820
04:50:26,300 --> 04:50:27,580
Everything's under NDA.

4821
04:50:27,580 --> 04:50:28,780
No, there's no NDA.

4822
04:50:29,900 --> 04:50:31,900
Everything's under NDA though, but there's no NDA.

4823
04:50:32,540 --> 04:50:33,740
I can't be also NDA.

4824
04:50:33,740 --> 04:50:34,620
I fucking can't stand them.

4825
04:50:36,780 --> 04:50:40,140
An elemental girl, like a flaming raccoon and that.

4826
04:50:40,140 --> 04:50:40,860
You know what's funny?

4827
04:50:40,860 --> 04:50:42,860
I sent away a spring in Skyrim,

4828
04:50:42,860 --> 04:50:45,660
and I did not get back a spring in Skyrim at all.

4829
04:50:46,460 --> 04:50:47,340
But I sent it away.

4830
04:50:47,340 --> 04:50:49,100
So I tried my best.

4831
04:50:49,740 --> 04:50:51,340
You are the NDA.

4832
04:50:51,340 --> 04:50:53,420
I'm an NDA's worst nightmare.

4833
04:50:53,420 --> 04:50:55,980
I am literally loose lip sync ships.

4834
04:50:55,980 --> 04:50:59,580
I cannot shut the fuck up about all my interests.

4835
04:50:59,580 --> 04:51:01,660
We've got the first animation back

4836
04:51:01,660 --> 04:51:05,180
for the alternative video game, and it looks good.

4837
04:51:05,180 --> 04:51:05,900
It looks good.

4838
04:51:07,020 --> 04:51:09,180
I just don't know how long it's going to take.

4839
04:51:09,180 --> 04:51:13,900
I still want to say July, end of July.

4840
04:51:15,740 --> 04:51:20,620
If not very early August, incredibly early August,

4841
04:51:20,700 --> 04:51:24,060
there's no way it's going past halfway through August.

4842
04:51:25,020 --> 04:51:26,780
We're just waiting on the animations,

4843
04:51:26,780 --> 04:51:27,740
and then everything,

4844
04:51:27,740 --> 04:51:29,660
all the puzzle pieces can be put together

4845
04:51:29,660 --> 04:51:31,580
once the animations are finalized.

4846
04:51:31,580 --> 04:51:34,700
I saw a preview of Icy's animation,

4847
04:51:34,700 --> 04:51:36,060
and you're welcome.

4848
04:51:36,940 --> 04:51:38,620
I saw I'm going to say you're welcome.

4849
04:51:40,620 --> 04:51:42,700
We only bring up some stuff to tease.

4850
04:51:42,700 --> 04:51:44,380
Yeah, I know you teasing.

4851
04:51:44,380 --> 04:51:45,980
I wanted to make a joke about our lips,

4852
04:51:45,980 --> 04:51:47,500
but the Japanese one wins.

4853
04:51:47,500 --> 04:51:48,140
I know.

4854
04:51:48,140 --> 04:51:49,420
You need to be quick.

4855
04:51:49,500 --> 04:51:51,340
You need to be quick,

4856
04:51:51,340 --> 04:51:53,420
if you want to make a joke on something I said,

4857
04:51:53,420 --> 04:51:55,180
because I'll be off it real quick.

4858
04:51:56,460 --> 04:51:57,900
As the human race has proven,

4859
04:51:57,900 --> 04:52:01,820
anything can be at this point.

4860
04:52:02,460 --> 04:52:03,180
You want us quick?

4861
04:52:03,180 --> 04:52:04,940
Are you kidding me right now?

4862
04:52:04,940 --> 04:52:06,300
I swear if this is a slime girl.

4863
04:52:06,300 --> 04:52:09,180
Strongly, if you're up for a scary game,

4864
04:52:09,180 --> 04:52:13,340
a few days ago a game called Still Wakes the Deep came out.

4865
04:52:13,340 --> 04:52:16,940
It takes place on a Scottish oil rig and has a great story.

4866
04:52:16,940 --> 04:52:17,900
Oh, does it?

4867
04:52:17,900 --> 04:52:18,620
Is it?

4868
04:52:18,620 --> 04:52:20,780
Oh, I need to get a heart rate monitor.

4869
04:52:20,780 --> 04:52:21,580
I don't.

4870
04:52:21,580 --> 04:52:21,900
Hold on.

4871
04:52:21,900 --> 04:52:23,500
Let me put it in my notes right now.

4872
04:52:23,500 --> 04:52:24,540
Like right this moment.

4873
04:52:46,380 --> 04:52:46,780
Hold on.

4874
04:52:46,780 --> 04:52:47,820
Let me write my notes.

4875
04:52:47,820 --> 04:52:48,380
Write my notes.

4876
04:52:48,780 --> 04:52:50,860
Heart rate monitor because I need it,

4877
04:52:50,860 --> 04:52:52,460
and then I need a new shot caller,

4878
04:52:52,460 --> 04:52:53,660
or actually hold on.

4879
04:52:54,300 --> 04:52:57,820
Sin sister, shot caller, cold smile.

4880
04:52:58,620 --> 04:53:00,700
Her problem now, not mine.

4881
04:53:01,900 --> 04:53:03,580
Yes, I might give it a shot.

4882
04:53:03,580 --> 04:53:05,740
Also, actually Scottish voice actors,

4883
04:53:05,740 --> 04:53:07,260
not Americans try to be Scottish.

4884
04:53:07,260 --> 04:53:08,860
Oh, praise the fucking Lord.

4885
04:53:08,860 --> 04:53:11,660
It's not that hard to find Scottish actors.

4886
04:53:11,660 --> 04:53:15,660
It's that thing like Junkrat and Overwatch as an American,

4887
04:53:15,660 --> 04:53:16,780
and it was like, oh, come on.

4888
04:53:16,780 --> 04:53:19,740
You're telling me there wasn't one voice actor available

4889
04:53:19,740 --> 04:53:21,900
that could do Maniac Australian?

4890
04:53:21,900 --> 04:53:23,340
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

4891
04:53:24,620 --> 04:53:25,660
Mentioning the heart rate monitor,

4892
04:53:25,660 --> 04:53:26,540
did you get the burner phone?

4893
04:53:26,540 --> 04:53:29,100
No, I'm going to ask Sin sister

4894
04:53:29,100 --> 04:53:31,020
if I could just use her phone number.

4895
04:53:31,020 --> 04:53:32,060
Yeah, oh, well, yeah.

4896
04:53:32,060 --> 04:53:34,300
Okay, well, we both just answered each other's question there.

4897
04:53:37,020 --> 04:53:40,540
He's getting the feeling for having a shield generator.

4898
04:53:41,980 --> 04:53:44,300
Is the Australian guy from Siege voice finals?

4899
04:53:44,300 --> 04:53:44,860
I have no idea.

4900
04:53:44,860 --> 04:53:46,540
Name two Scottish voice actors.

4901
04:53:51,340 --> 04:53:52,860
Strony Cuttles and Sin sister.

4902
04:53:52,860 --> 04:53:53,180
Thank you.

4903
04:53:53,180 --> 04:53:53,420
Thank you.

4904
04:53:53,420 --> 04:53:54,140
I'll be here all day.

4905
04:53:54,940 --> 04:53:55,500
Anyone else?

4906
04:53:55,500 --> 04:53:55,980
Anyone else?

4907
04:53:58,780 --> 04:54:02,780
I promise you it's not that hard to find actual a Scottish.

4908
04:54:03,420 --> 04:54:05,180
Well, actually, Sin sister doesn't count

4909
04:54:05,180 --> 04:54:05,900
because she's not.

4910
04:54:07,980 --> 04:54:09,340
She's honorary Scott.

4911
04:54:09,340 --> 04:54:10,140
You know what I mean?

4912
04:54:10,140 --> 04:54:11,660
Okay, look, you know what I mean?

4913
04:54:12,700 --> 04:54:13,820
No, Sin isn't Scottish.

4914
04:54:15,580 --> 04:54:16,940
You thought I was Welsh?

4915
04:54:16,940 --> 04:54:17,740
What the fuck?

4916
04:54:19,260 --> 04:54:20,060
Are you trolling?

4917
04:54:20,060 --> 04:54:21,420
You did not think I was Welsh.

4918
04:54:22,940 --> 04:54:23,900
Isn't Welsh like,

4919
04:54:25,500 --> 04:54:28,220
I'm the only gay in the village that's Welsh?

4920
04:54:29,340 --> 04:54:33,580
No. Sin is honorary Scott,

4921
04:54:33,580 --> 04:54:34,860
which not actually is not.

4922
04:54:36,460 --> 04:54:38,460
No one can do a good fake Scott accent.

4923
04:54:39,260 --> 04:54:43,180
It's like there is no Welsh and Strony now.

4924
04:54:45,740 --> 04:54:47,100
Someone thought you were Welsh or anything.

4925
04:54:47,100 --> 04:54:48,780
Oh my God, Sheep Girl, Gen 2 confirmed.

4926
04:54:49,580 --> 04:54:54,060
And then POV, you're supposed to be a Sheep Shagger.

4927
04:54:54,060 --> 04:54:54,860
Oh, that's awful.

4928
04:54:54,860 --> 04:54:55,980
I'm sorry for even saying that.

4929
04:54:56,860 --> 04:54:58,060
It's funny in the moment,

4930
04:54:58,060 --> 04:54:59,340
but now that I've said it out loud.

4931
04:54:59,340 --> 04:55:01,340
Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous as well.

4932
04:55:01,340 --> 04:55:03,020
But yes, I'll definitely,

4933
04:55:03,020 --> 04:55:04,460
once the heart rate monitor comes through,

4934
04:55:04,460 --> 04:55:05,820
I will be messing around.

4935
04:55:05,820 --> 04:55:10,540
I want to do that fitness Nintendo game Ring Fit,

4936
04:55:10,540 --> 04:55:12,300
but again, I need a heart rate monitor

4937
04:55:12,300 --> 04:55:14,540
to show you how quickly my heart is about to explode

4938
04:55:14,540 --> 04:55:16,540
because I'm needing to get some exercise in

4939
04:55:16,540 --> 04:55:18,060
and because I'm streaming all along,

4940
04:55:18,060 --> 04:55:19,580
I'm not really getting that exercise.

4941
04:55:20,780 --> 04:55:22,300
I'm being a naughty girl.

4942
04:55:23,340 --> 04:55:25,260
I'm not getting that exercise.

4943
04:55:25,260 --> 04:55:26,540
I'm going to do it with you.

4944
04:55:28,940 --> 04:55:30,140
But yes, I'm going to be doing that.

4945
04:55:32,780 --> 04:55:37,180
No, I've got my first limited ad stream.

4946
04:55:37,980 --> 04:55:40,700
No, this cannot.

4947
04:55:40,700 --> 04:55:41,820
No, what?

4948
04:55:41,900 --> 04:55:43,660
I've got, no.

4949
04:55:43,660 --> 04:55:45,820
More things have been hit with limited ads.

4950
04:55:47,100 --> 04:55:47,980
No way.

4951
04:55:50,860 --> 04:55:55,020
My freaking, my RuneScape stream.

4952
04:55:56,860 --> 04:56:00,220
My RuneScape stream where I got Wrecked and Connect 4

4953
04:56:00,220 --> 04:56:01,740
got hit with limited ads.

4954
04:56:01,740 --> 04:56:03,020
Don't you dare, YouTube.

4955
04:56:04,220 --> 04:56:05,500
Stop it, YouTube.

4956
04:56:05,500 --> 04:56:06,780
You're so stinky.

4957
04:56:08,460 --> 04:56:11,180
Okay, but all my other stuff is fine.

4958
04:56:11,420 --> 04:56:14,780
Literally the RuneScape is probably because of the tinfoil.

4959
04:56:14,780 --> 04:56:16,540
We spoke too much about BlackRock.

4960
04:56:16,540 --> 04:56:17,180
They got me.

4961
04:56:17,180 --> 04:56:17,740
I can't believe it.

4962
04:56:17,740 --> 04:56:18,940
They're killing my income source.

4963
04:56:19,820 --> 04:56:21,340
Right, I just,

4964
04:56:21,340 --> 04:56:23,820
I'm going to redirect into mimosa in a second.

4965
04:56:23,820 --> 04:56:27,500
I do want to say tomorrow,

4966
04:56:29,580 --> 04:56:32,700
if I'm not mistaken, is Valtral, okay?

4967
04:56:33,740 --> 04:56:34,700
But hear me out.

4968
04:56:35,580 --> 04:56:41,020
It is two hours after my usual stream start time.

4969
04:56:41,740 --> 04:56:42,060
Okay?

4970
04:56:42,780 --> 04:56:44,140
It's going to be a shorter stream

4971
04:56:44,140 --> 04:56:46,940
so I can focus on some ASMR work as I always do.

4972
04:56:47,660 --> 04:56:50,380
In Valtral, oh, sorry.

4973
04:56:50,380 --> 04:56:52,300
Ballatral or Valtral.

4974
04:56:55,100 --> 04:56:57,740
It starts two hours later

4975
04:56:57,740 --> 04:56:59,900
because Veeler having a meet-in.

4976
04:56:59,900 --> 04:57:02,780
I need to make sure the girls are all good and even fine.

4977
04:57:02,860 --> 04:57:04,060
Catch them up with them

4978
04:57:04,060 --> 04:57:05,980
because I really had a chance to talk to them all.

4979
04:57:07,260 --> 04:57:08,540
Obviously, Emma doesn't count

4980
04:57:08,540 --> 04:57:10,380
because she's not even at her PC.

4981
04:57:10,380 --> 04:57:11,580
She's not even in the company.

4982
04:57:12,940 --> 04:57:15,260
But yeah, we're going to have a nice little girl group meeting

4983
04:57:15,260 --> 04:57:18,380
and the best time zone for it was my start time

4984
04:57:18,380 --> 04:57:21,500
because American, Europe, mashed together.

4985
04:57:21,500 --> 04:57:22,620
And what do you get? A pancake.

4986
04:57:25,100 --> 04:57:26,700
So I'm going to be two hours.

4987
04:57:27,260 --> 04:57:28,460
No, I'm not going to be late.

4988
04:57:28,460 --> 04:57:29,820
The stream is two hours later.

4989
04:57:29,820 --> 04:57:31,820
So just keep that in mind for Valtral.

4990
04:57:31,820 --> 04:57:33,660
The stream is two hours later than usual

4991
04:57:34,300 --> 04:57:36,540
just because I'm catching up with my girls,

4992
04:57:36,540 --> 04:57:37,900
making sure everything's okay

4993
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:39,580
and everyone's having a good time.

4994
04:57:40,940 --> 04:57:43,740
Because it's all fine and well,

4995
04:57:43,740 --> 04:57:45,980
like sending a message or a DM and being like,

4996
04:57:45,980 --> 04:57:46,700
oh, are you good?

4997
04:57:46,700 --> 04:57:48,860
But when you hear someone in voice chat,

4998
04:57:48,860 --> 04:57:50,060
they can bring up concerns

4999
04:57:50,060 --> 04:57:52,940
or they can bring up things they maybe hoped

5000
04:57:52,940 --> 04:57:54,700
would be better or have gone better.

5001
04:57:54,700 --> 04:57:59,260
So yeah, too early.

5002
04:57:59,260 --> 04:58:00,860
I don't really think it's going to be that long

5003
04:58:00,860 --> 04:58:01,820
unless we girls can.

5004
04:58:03,020 --> 04:58:04,780
You know what happens when girls get together?

5005
04:58:04,780 --> 04:58:05,740
Can't shut the fuck up.

5006
04:58:06,940 --> 04:58:08,940
But yeah, two hours extra sleep.

5007
04:58:08,940 --> 04:58:09,500
Nice.

5008
04:58:09,500 --> 04:58:11,820
Yeah, it's literally for the folk

5009
04:58:11,820 --> 04:58:14,460
who are like absolutely exhausted.

5010
04:58:14,460 --> 04:58:15,740
You get two extra hours.

5011
04:58:17,580 --> 04:58:20,140
God, my French tip nails are growing.

5012
04:58:20,140 --> 04:58:22,140
The fuck is actually getting pretty gross now.

5013
04:58:22,140 --> 04:58:24,060
I'll have to admit, yeah.

5014
04:58:25,420 --> 04:58:26,620
Yapping intensifies.

5015
04:58:26,620 --> 04:58:28,780
Yeah, basically it's just going to be a big old yap fest

5016
04:58:28,860 --> 04:58:30,300
and I'll be like, I hope you guys are okay.

5017
04:58:30,300 --> 04:58:31,500
And everyone will be like, yeah, you're okay.

5018
04:58:32,700 --> 04:58:35,500
And I completely forgot to do that 5K celebration

5019
04:58:36,220 --> 04:58:37,500
because everyone hit 5K.

5020
04:58:37,500 --> 04:58:41,020
So I'm going to see if I can get the social media manager

5021
04:58:41,020 --> 04:58:45,420
to post the artwork I got for it as a celebration.

5022
04:58:45,420 --> 04:58:48,380
I cannot wait for you guys to see the 10K celebration

5023
04:58:48,380 --> 04:58:49,580
on everyone.

5024
04:58:49,580 --> 04:58:51,340
I got a really good artwork.

5025
04:58:51,340 --> 04:58:52,300
Sorry, but it's like that.

5026
04:58:54,140 --> 04:58:55,820
It's a beautiful 10K artwork.

5027
04:58:56,700 --> 04:59:01,100
You VLU girls are running your purr fans' ragged.

5028
04:59:01,660 --> 04:59:03,660
Are you drained like that one meme?

5029
04:59:04,860 --> 04:59:05,580
Don't mention it.

5030
04:59:05,580 --> 04:59:06,620
How's your heart doing?

5031
04:59:06,620 --> 04:59:07,580
A lot better.

5032
04:59:07,580 --> 04:59:14,940
It's still like blood underneath the skin.

5033
04:59:16,940 --> 04:59:19,100
That's what it is at the moment.

5034
04:59:21,500 --> 04:59:23,180
A video or a picture.

5035
04:59:23,180 --> 04:59:24,700
An artwork.

5036
04:59:24,700 --> 04:59:27,660
I got a special artwork for 10K,000 subscribers.

5037
04:59:27,660 --> 04:59:31,180
For like, when everyone reaches 10,000 subscribers,

5038
04:59:31,980 --> 04:59:35,180
it will go live and it's a beautiful piece of artwork.

5039
04:59:35,980 --> 04:59:37,260
I absolutely adore it.

5040
04:59:37,260 --> 04:59:46,140
I think we might try and work on free access rewards at Milestones.

5041
04:59:46,140 --> 04:59:51,740
So you know how I'm kind of doing one ASMR video per 1,000 subscribers?

5042
04:59:52,460 --> 04:59:56,140
I obviously am in a bit of a deficit and need to start uploading them.

5043
04:59:56,140 --> 04:59:56,540
But I will.

5044
04:59:56,540 --> 04:59:57,100
I'm getting on it.

5045
04:59:57,100 --> 04:59:58,140
I promise I'm getting on it.

5046
04:59:58,140 --> 05:00:06,380
I am going to see if the girls might consider doing,

5047
05:00:06,380 --> 05:00:08,940
even if it's like a voice pack, for example,

5048
05:00:10,460 --> 05:00:14,220
or like a thank you audio on the alternative account,

5049
05:00:14,220 --> 05:00:16,380
something like that when they reach Milestones,

5050
05:00:16,380 --> 05:00:18,380
just to make things like a bit sweeter,

5051
05:00:18,460 --> 05:00:21,900
like any support you are clipping or tweeting or retweeting,

5052
05:00:21,900 --> 05:00:23,980
or you know, any support like that.

5053
05:00:23,980 --> 05:00:28,060
It just, it feels a bit sweeter and that you are getting rewarded for it.

5054
05:00:30,060 --> 05:00:31,740
I think the problem is more YouTube you already made.

5055
05:00:31,740 --> 05:00:33,980
I definitely did make the 2K one,

5056
05:00:33,980 --> 05:00:36,700
but I'll go back to the drawing board.

5057
05:00:36,700 --> 05:00:37,660
It's not a problem.

5058
05:00:37,660 --> 05:00:40,300
I'm going to do a tapping one with my fake nails,

5059
05:00:40,300 --> 05:00:43,020
because fake nails sound awesome when it comes to tapping anymore.

5060
05:00:43,980 --> 05:00:44,540
And strong.

5061
05:00:44,540 --> 05:00:46,140
Your feet are still hot listening.

5062
05:00:46,140 --> 05:00:46,780
Oh, don't.

5063
05:00:46,780 --> 05:00:48,140
Oh, don't say it like that.

5064
05:00:48,940 --> 05:00:49,900
Don't say it like that.

5065
05:00:51,740 --> 05:00:55,580
And I'm basically that Mexican alien.

5066
05:00:57,580 --> 05:01:03,100
And but yes, I am going to let you guys get redirected into mimosa.

5067
05:01:03,100 --> 05:01:08,540
Please do consider hanging about for a couple of cheeky minutes or so,

5068
05:01:08,540 --> 05:01:11,500
because she is very close to being monetized.

5069
05:01:11,500 --> 05:01:13,660
She just needs to watch ours.

5070
05:01:13,660 --> 05:01:16,540
So she's pushing herself for an endurance stream,

5071
05:01:16,540 --> 05:01:24,780
which has made her a perfect target for my Borderlands 2 gameplay that I want to sort out.

5072
05:01:24,780 --> 05:01:26,940
I want to see if I maybe get it done in July.

5073
05:01:28,620 --> 05:01:30,620
Mimosa seems like a good candidate.

5074
05:01:30,620 --> 05:01:34,620
I'm wondering if I could grab an endurance stream from VNU,

5075
05:01:34,620 --> 05:01:38,300
and then an endurance streamer from Mythos.

5076
05:01:38,300 --> 05:01:41,580
And then it could be like a really cool four way like get to know each other.

5077
05:01:43,580 --> 05:01:46,540
There's been fucking VTubers are so nice to me, by the way.

5078
05:01:46,540 --> 05:01:47,100
Holy shit.

5079
05:01:47,100 --> 05:01:49,100
I've got another ASMR collab on the way.

5080
05:01:50,380 --> 05:01:53,580
Turns out VTubers like are so kind and give you the time of day.

5081
05:01:53,580 --> 05:01:57,900
Like I redirected into AcoNono.

5082
05:01:57,900 --> 05:02:01,420
Did you see her little fucking call saying it was so good?

5083
05:02:01,420 --> 05:02:02,060
I don't know.

5084
05:02:02,060 --> 05:02:03,100
Sorry, not AcoNono.

5085
05:02:03,100 --> 05:02:03,740
I don't know.

5086
05:02:03,740 --> 05:02:04,540
With the bouquets.

5087
05:02:04,860 --> 05:02:09,100
And she was like, I think Strongie is a cult fish and stuff.

5088
05:02:09,100 --> 05:02:11,020
And then she followed me on Twitter and I'm like,

5089
05:02:11,020 --> 05:02:13,260
Gee, Willy, Curse, you've got me blushing now.

5090
05:02:13,260 --> 05:02:13,740
Stop it.

5091
05:02:15,500 --> 05:02:17,180
But yeah, VTubers are so fucking nice.

5092
05:02:17,180 --> 05:02:18,300
Sorry, I don't care where anyone says.

5093
05:02:18,300 --> 05:02:19,420
I'll defend VTubers.

5094
05:02:20,060 --> 05:02:20,940
Yeah, alias.

5095
05:02:20,940 --> 05:02:22,380
Literally VTubers are so nice.

5096
05:02:22,380 --> 05:02:22,940
I said it.

5097
05:02:22,940 --> 05:02:23,580
I said it.

5098
05:02:23,580 --> 05:02:24,060
They're nice.

5099
05:02:24,060 --> 05:02:25,180
Everyone seems so nice to me.

5100
05:02:25,180 --> 05:02:25,740
What the fuck?

5101
05:02:25,740 --> 05:02:27,820
They're not like, oh sorry, that was my controller.

5102
05:02:27,820 --> 05:02:28,780
They're not like, oh you whore.

5103
05:02:28,780 --> 05:02:29,900
I don't want to interact with you.

5104
05:02:29,900 --> 05:02:31,260
They're like, oh my god, it's you.

5105
05:02:31,260 --> 05:02:32,860
Yeah, I'd love to do an ASMR collab.

5106
05:02:32,860 --> 05:02:34,460
And I'm like, oh, it's so freaking cute.

5107
05:02:34,460 --> 05:02:35,260
The yes chant.

5108
05:02:35,260 --> 05:02:35,980
Yeah, it's for him.

5109
05:02:37,660 --> 05:02:39,580
We love VTubers around these parts.

5110
05:02:39,580 --> 05:02:40,620
Let's go.

5111
05:02:40,620 --> 05:02:41,100
Yes.

5112
05:02:41,100 --> 05:02:41,980
Okay.

5113
05:02:41,980 --> 05:02:45,740
I am going to go offline and give me 15 minutes.

5114
05:02:45,740 --> 05:02:47,180
I'm going to get some food down my gullet

5115
05:02:47,180 --> 05:02:48,540
and I'm going to get a cup of tea

5116
05:02:48,540 --> 05:02:52,220
and then I'll come back for a membership ASMR stream again

5117
05:02:52,220 --> 05:02:53,980
where we can just babble away to each other.

5118
05:02:55,420 --> 05:02:56,780
If you an alias collab.

5119
05:02:56,780 --> 05:02:59,020
Oh, I've not even, I've not, it wasn't alias.

5120
05:02:59,020 --> 05:03:02,220
I was actually someone else who I've never interacted with before.

5121
05:03:02,860 --> 05:03:06,700
They agreed to that collab, but I don't know.

5122
05:03:06,700 --> 05:03:08,620
Maybe I should be a cheeky shite and ask alias.

5123
05:03:09,580 --> 05:03:09,900
I don't know.

5124
05:03:09,900 --> 05:03:11,340
I feel like it's getting really cheeky now

5125
05:03:11,340 --> 05:03:14,060
because I think that would be my 10th ass collab

5126
05:03:14,060 --> 05:03:15,500
and only one is up right now.

5127
05:03:15,500 --> 05:03:16,780
But it's because I need time to do it.

5128
05:03:16,780 --> 05:03:18,300
And I don't, as far as I'm aware,

5129
05:03:18,300 --> 05:03:20,380
I don't think any VTuber is like, oh my god,

5130
05:03:20,380 --> 05:03:22,540
you've still not done, you've still not sent me your script.

5131
05:03:22,540 --> 05:03:24,460
You've still not like edited it together.

5132
05:03:24,460 --> 05:03:25,740
I don't think anyone's being cheeky.

5133
05:03:25,740 --> 05:03:28,460
I'm like, I think they can see like how hard I'm trying elsewhere.

5134
05:03:29,500 --> 05:03:30,620
And I'll get there slowly.

5135
05:03:30,620 --> 05:03:32,220
Things will, things will go slowly.

5136
05:03:33,420 --> 05:03:37,900
Um, V4, well, I was actually gonna start getting on at them

5137
05:03:37,900 --> 05:03:40,540
because Dr. Nova was so nice to me as well.

5138
05:03:40,540 --> 05:03:42,460
She was such a cutie, Batuti.

5139
05:03:42,460 --> 05:03:45,020
She did like the spit thing with Shibi's mouth

5140
05:03:45,020 --> 05:03:46,860
and I was like, that's honestly so creative.

5141
05:03:46,860 --> 05:03:48,780
My brain could not even figure out how you did that.

5142
05:03:49,660 --> 05:03:50,780
A perfectionist.

5143
05:03:50,780 --> 05:03:52,300
Oh no, I'm not a perfectionist.

5144
05:03:52,300 --> 05:03:55,020
It's because I've run out of time and I'm mentally exhausted.

5145
05:03:55,020 --> 05:03:57,500
Like yesterday, I had a complete like,

5146
05:03:58,540 --> 05:04:01,260
um, my body finally broke down,

5147
05:04:01,340 --> 05:04:03,500
but in a good way that allowed me to sleep.

5148
05:04:03,500 --> 05:04:06,060
So basically I finished the Umi Plus collab

5149
05:04:06,060 --> 05:04:07,500
after my three streams that day,

5150
05:04:07,500 --> 05:04:10,380
just, just feeling like a little bit of an overachiever there.

5151
05:04:10,940 --> 05:04:18,940
Um, and then I did, um, I went straight to bed.

5152
05:04:18,940 --> 05:04:20,540
I went straight to sleep.

5153
05:04:20,540 --> 05:04:23,660
I slept for about five hours, woke up.

5154
05:04:23,660 --> 05:04:27,260
I was like, I need to birth this loaf of bread right effing now.

5155
05:04:27,260 --> 05:04:31,740
Did that, had a shower, ordered takeaway as I do normally.

5156
05:04:33,500 --> 05:04:35,740
And then I passed out again until Microsoft.

5157
05:04:35,740 --> 05:04:38,060
I woke up 10 minutes before Microsoft,

5158
05:04:38,060 --> 05:04:40,300
but I've finally had a rest.

5159
05:04:40,300 --> 05:04:42,540
Like, I don't feel that exhaustion

5160
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:45,180
that was looming over me for so long.

5161
05:04:45,180 --> 05:04:46,620
Like, I don't feel it right now.

5162
05:04:46,620 --> 05:04:47,660
I'm so freaking glad.

5163
05:04:48,380 --> 05:04:49,260
How's the loaf?

5164
05:04:49,260 --> 05:04:52,140
The loaf, um, yes, it's gone.

5165
05:04:52,860 --> 05:04:53,660
The loaf is gone.

5166
05:04:54,940 --> 05:04:56,460
Well, the spit in the air, she's crazy.

5167
05:04:56,540 --> 05:04:58,220
There's a lot of very unique stuff apparently.

5168
05:04:58,220 --> 05:05:00,220
Oh, right.

5169
05:05:02,060 --> 05:05:04,540
No, no, finally taking care.

5170
05:05:04,540 --> 05:05:07,420
It's, things are so, it's because there's so much chaos

5171
05:05:07,420 --> 05:05:08,540
and start in the first month,

5172
05:05:08,540 --> 05:05:10,860
but now that the first month like is over,

5173
05:05:11,740 --> 05:05:15,180
um, we can actually do it.

5174
05:05:17,340 --> 05:05:18,540
We can actually do it.

5175
05:05:18,540 --> 05:05:20,460
We can actually like achieve all our,

5176
05:05:20,460 --> 05:05:23,100
uh, missions and objectives and all of that.

5177
05:05:23,100 --> 05:05:26,380
Like, oh, and like fucking hell,

5178
05:05:26,380 --> 05:05:27,740
it's been like, well, hold on.

5179
05:05:27,740 --> 05:05:29,500
I'm going to open up my YouTube stats right now.

5180
05:05:30,620 --> 05:05:33,260
It's been a month of streaming

5181
05:05:33,260 --> 05:05:38,060
and I have made 300,000 views on my content.

5182
05:05:39,340 --> 05:05:41,020
And the month hasn't even finished.

5183
05:05:41,020 --> 05:05:43,500
I mean, hell, maybe even be more to it, you know?

5184
05:05:45,420 --> 05:05:48,380
Literally, I am over a quarter of a million views

5185
05:05:48,380 --> 05:05:50,380
and I'm a new VTuber and it's been a month.

5186
05:05:50,460 --> 05:05:52,860
Like, y'all know, y'all know.

5187
05:05:53,900 --> 05:05:56,220
Uh, what does it say for subscribers?

5188
05:05:56,220 --> 05:05:58,780
8,600, like it's the first month.

5189
05:05:58,780 --> 05:05:59,660
This is insane.

5190
05:05:59,660 --> 05:06:00,700
This is insanity.

5191
05:06:01,420 --> 05:06:04,300
Um, so I definitely want to start pushing those ASMR videos

5192
05:06:04,300 --> 05:06:06,220
out consistently because I don't want to,

5193
05:06:06,220 --> 05:06:09,260
I don't want anyone thinking I'm taking like the PS

5194
05:06:09,260 --> 05:06:10,220
when I'm doing it, you know?

5195
05:06:11,500 --> 05:06:14,060
I thought she was about to say 300,000 dollars.

5196
05:06:14,060 --> 05:06:16,300
Well, if I make 300,000 dollars,

5197
05:06:16,300 --> 05:06:17,820
I'm happy to say that, yeah,

5198
05:06:17,820 --> 05:06:19,260
Gentoon through your end production

5199
05:06:19,260 --> 05:06:20,860
and no, I do not need to do a donathon.

5200
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:25,020
But yeah, for my birthday donathon,

5201
05:06:25,020 --> 05:06:26,460
which is October 10th,

5202
05:06:26,460 --> 05:06:32,700
my goals are pretty much set up to be agency-orientated.

5203
05:06:33,900 --> 05:06:34,300
So yeah.

5204
05:06:35,740 --> 05:06:37,580
Strangely, if you don't care yourself,

5205
05:06:37,580 --> 05:06:38,540
you'll be mad.

5206
05:06:38,540 --> 05:06:39,020
P.S.

5207
05:06:39,820 --> 05:06:41,500
Considering it's you, I mean, that's surprising.

5208
05:06:42,060 --> 05:06:43,420
It's because you put out four times

5209
05:06:43,420 --> 05:06:44,460
the average amount of content,

5210
05:06:44,460 --> 05:06:47,260
you get tons of views from your consistent viewer base.

5211
05:06:47,260 --> 05:06:48,460
For again, I was getting worried,

5212
05:06:48,460 --> 05:06:49,580
you guys aren't going to like stuff,

5213
05:06:49,580 --> 05:06:50,540
but you always do.

5214
05:06:50,540 --> 05:06:54,620
And I'm like, is this what unconditional love feels like?

5215
05:06:54,620 --> 05:06:55,980
Oh, my heart.

5216
05:06:55,980 --> 05:06:58,460
Oh, it made me cry.

5217
05:06:59,660 --> 05:07:02,620
Um, I can't wait to see the birthday

5218
05:07:02,620 --> 05:07:04,700
just to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood again.

5219
05:07:04,700 --> 05:07:06,940
Honestly, I'm so, I'm so ready.

5220
05:07:08,060 --> 05:07:09,580
Such a hard worker.

5221
05:07:09,580 --> 05:07:12,060
I work hard because you guys won't beat me, okay?

5222
05:07:13,900 --> 05:07:15,180
Did you see the Sheevee clip

5223
05:07:15,180 --> 05:07:18,300
where she talked about all your fan bases,

5224
05:07:18,300 --> 05:07:19,100
my wee wifling?

5225
05:07:20,380 --> 05:07:22,060
All your wiflings are belong to us.

5226
05:07:22,780 --> 05:07:25,020
You're a pretty likable person, thank yous,

5227
05:07:25,020 --> 05:07:26,780
because I used to wipe ass in care homes.

5228
05:07:27,500 --> 05:07:29,340
I mean, it humbles you very much

5229
05:07:29,340 --> 05:07:31,900
when you wipe old lady ass, I have to admit.

5230
05:07:31,900 --> 05:07:35,980
Or an old man gets a bone bone

5231
05:07:35,980 --> 05:07:37,660
because you're having to change his diaper,

5232
05:07:37,660 --> 05:07:38,380
so that's really fun.

5233
05:07:39,340 --> 05:07:40,140
It really humbles you.

5234
05:07:40,140 --> 05:07:43,020
It really gives you a very unique, strong personality, you know?

5235
05:07:45,980 --> 05:07:48,940
Um, you could do a stream of watching paint dry

5236
05:07:48,940 --> 05:07:49,980
and I'd probably watch it with you.

5237
05:07:49,980 --> 05:07:51,260
Hey, let's do it.

5238
05:07:51,260 --> 05:07:52,700
Shawnee, you need to learn that we love you.

5239
05:07:52,700 --> 05:07:53,740
We love everything you do.

5240
05:07:53,740 --> 05:07:55,420
Darling, that'll be nice to me.

5241
05:07:56,140 --> 05:07:58,460
If we miss one stream, we miss a week's worth of yeah

5242
05:07:58,460 --> 05:07:59,980
when it's compared to others.

5243
05:07:59,980 --> 05:08:03,020
Well, you guys were telling me that people that do,

5244
05:08:03,020 --> 05:08:04,460
that have membership,

5245
05:08:04,460 --> 05:08:07,100
some people like do one membership stream a month.

5246
05:08:07,100 --> 05:08:11,580
I'm like, this is an exchange of goods and services.

5247
05:08:11,580 --> 05:08:14,620
You have to make the exchange of goods and services worth it.

5248
05:08:15,340 --> 05:08:15,900
Don't you?

5249
05:08:16,620 --> 05:08:18,300
All right, don't people move away

5250
05:08:18,300 --> 05:08:20,620
if you don't make it worth their time, worth their whale?

5251
05:08:23,660 --> 05:08:24,540
I wouldn't get humbled.

5252
05:08:24,540 --> 05:08:26,780
I'm more like boosted, to be honest.

5253
05:08:27,500 --> 05:08:29,820
I, I don't know if it's because I grew up

5254
05:08:29,820 --> 05:08:31,900
looking after like cats and all of that.

5255
05:08:32,620 --> 05:08:42,460
Um, that basically any puke cat or shat,

5256
05:08:43,100 --> 05:08:44,380
it doesn't really faze me.

5257
05:08:45,020 --> 05:08:47,580
And like, yeah, the thing,

5258
05:08:47,580 --> 05:08:49,420
probably the thing that grosses me out

5259
05:08:49,420 --> 05:08:51,260
is like a decomposing corpse.

5260
05:08:51,260 --> 05:08:53,500
That's probably what would gross me out

5261
05:08:53,500 --> 05:08:55,980
in terms of like body fluids and stuff.

5262
05:08:55,980 --> 05:08:58,460
Like, I don't, this is kind of off topic,

5263
05:08:58,460 --> 05:08:59,500
but um, you know,

5264
05:08:59,500 --> 05:09:02,140
if you have a dementia patient in your care,

5265
05:09:02,140 --> 05:09:06,700
it's actually quite common to do brown smearing,

5266
05:09:07,420 --> 05:09:09,500
brown painting, if you will.

5267
05:09:09,500 --> 05:09:10,940
It's actually quite common.

5268
05:09:11,740 --> 05:09:12,940
Because when you have dementia,

5269
05:09:12,940 --> 05:09:14,780
you lose, you don't understand what you're doing.

5270
05:09:15,660 --> 05:09:16,780
And it's just a wee shame.

5271
05:09:16,780 --> 05:09:19,020
And like when, you know,

5272
05:09:19,020 --> 05:09:21,020
for example, when I entered the room,

5273
05:09:21,020 --> 05:09:24,060
you know, you go, you get shocked at first

5274
05:09:24,060 --> 05:09:25,180
and then you're like, wait,

5275
05:09:25,180 --> 05:09:27,980
if I don't clean up this, this person,

5276
05:09:27,980 --> 05:09:29,500
you know, they're going to be,

5277
05:09:29,500 --> 05:09:31,180
you know, sitting in this situation

5278
05:09:31,180 --> 05:09:31,980
and it's not nice.

5279
05:09:31,980 --> 05:09:33,340
So you do the right thing

5280
05:09:33,340 --> 05:09:35,500
and you know, you put your protective gear on

5281
05:09:35,500 --> 05:09:37,820
and you get to work and make sure they're all showered

5282
05:09:37,820 --> 05:09:39,580
and fresh sheets and all that.

5283
05:09:39,580 --> 05:09:40,700
And you just get to it.

5284
05:09:40,700 --> 05:09:42,060
That's, it's just how it is.

5285
05:09:42,140 --> 05:09:43,180
It's very straightforward.

5286
05:09:43,180 --> 05:09:44,220
I know it can be quite,

5287
05:09:46,860 --> 05:09:48,060
quite daunting, I guess,

5288
05:09:48,060 --> 05:09:50,220
maybe if the first time you're ever tasked with it,

5289
05:09:50,220 --> 05:09:53,340
but it makes you realize like, look, yeah,

5290
05:09:53,340 --> 05:09:54,380
okay, it's a bit gross.

5291
05:09:54,380 --> 05:09:55,580
Yeah, it doesn't smell nice.

5292
05:09:55,580 --> 05:09:57,900
No one's expected it to smell

5293
05:09:57,900 --> 05:09:59,500
like marshmallow fluff or whatever.

5294
05:09:59,500 --> 05:10:01,740
But yeah, you know, you just,

5295
05:10:01,740 --> 05:10:02,460
you just go for it.

5296
05:10:02,460 --> 05:10:04,460
You do the right, you do the best you can.

5297
05:10:08,460 --> 05:10:11,660
Yeah, dementia decline has actually tried it.

5298
05:10:11,660 --> 05:10:13,740
Yeah, it's, it's pretty fucking rough.

5299
05:10:13,740 --> 05:10:14,380
I have to admit.

5300
05:10:15,340 --> 05:10:17,740
Maui, Maui Gran had a fall

5301
05:10:17,740 --> 05:10:19,580
and a lot of sickness followed.

5302
05:10:19,580 --> 05:10:21,020
I don't know what it is.

5303
05:10:21,020 --> 05:10:22,460
Well, I don't know what it is.

5304
05:10:22,460 --> 05:10:26,620
Basically, old person has fall deteriorates rapidly.

5305
05:10:26,620 --> 05:10:28,940
More news at three is the most common way

5306
05:10:28,940 --> 05:10:30,620
that an old person pops or clogs.

5307
05:10:30,620 --> 05:10:31,100
I don't know.

5308
05:10:31,100 --> 05:10:31,980
Well, I don't know why

5309
05:10:31,980 --> 05:10:33,580
because it's like a shock to the system

5310
05:10:33,580 --> 05:10:35,020
and the body can't repair.

5311
05:10:35,020 --> 05:10:37,100
I think they say after the age of 30,

5312
05:10:37,100 --> 05:10:39,180
your body no longer is growing

5313
05:10:39,180 --> 05:10:40,220
and becoming a new.

5314
05:10:40,220 --> 05:10:43,180
It's just focusing on repair and maintenance

5315
05:10:43,180 --> 05:10:44,220
beyond like 30.

5316
05:10:46,380 --> 05:10:48,220
Did anyone paint anything cool?

5317
05:10:48,220 --> 05:10:49,420
One, that's funny too.

5318
05:10:49,420 --> 05:10:50,140
Shut the fuck up.

5319
05:10:53,420 --> 05:10:55,340
The fact that you could do it is commendable.

5320
05:10:55,340 --> 05:10:56,380
I've seen the bad parents.

5321
05:10:57,260 --> 05:10:59,580
Like honestly, if you ever like have to be the caretaker

5322
05:10:59,580 --> 05:11:00,700
of someone with dementia,

5323
05:11:00,700 --> 05:11:02,860
don't ever feel bad if you have to put them in a care home.

5324
05:11:02,860 --> 05:11:04,860
Like I know there's so many stories

5325
05:11:04,860 --> 05:11:07,420
that come out about care homes being bad at this and that.

5326
05:11:07,420 --> 05:11:09,980
I promise you at the forefront of care homes,

5327
05:11:09,980 --> 05:11:12,300
there are people who genuinely have the willpower

5328
05:11:12,300 --> 05:11:14,460
and the care, like they do genuinely care

5329
05:11:14,460 --> 05:11:15,660
and try their best.

5330
05:11:15,660 --> 05:11:17,980
The problem is the greedy corporations

5331
05:11:17,980 --> 05:11:20,700
that purposely understaff entire units.

5332
05:11:20,700 --> 05:11:23,340
I think my worst ever shift was like

5333
05:11:24,380 --> 05:11:28,540
to people to over 50 residents on one floor.

5334
05:11:29,100 --> 05:11:32,060
Like, no, it's not possible.

5335
05:11:33,020 --> 05:11:34,460
It's not possible.

5336
05:11:34,460 --> 05:11:35,420
So, yeah.

5337
05:11:36,380 --> 05:11:40,060
Yeah, as you age, you get worse at healing

5338
05:11:40,060 --> 05:11:41,340
and in the case of the elderly,

5339
05:11:41,340 --> 05:11:43,260
falling loss of balance is like just,

5340
05:11:43,260 --> 05:11:44,620
yeah, like fricking straight up.

5341
05:11:45,420 --> 05:11:46,620
Hey, strongy, you done with gaming?

5342
05:11:46,620 --> 05:11:48,700
I'm so sorry, MLG did it.

5343
05:11:48,700 --> 05:11:54,220
The Microsoft was supposedly supposed to be eight hours,

5344
05:11:54,220 --> 05:11:56,220
but that was a game developers assessment.

5345
05:11:56,220 --> 05:11:57,500
So they were wrong.

5346
05:11:57,500 --> 05:11:58,300
They were wrong.

5347
05:12:01,420 --> 05:12:03,660
I've seen nurses in care homes mistreat the elderly.

5348
05:12:03,660 --> 05:12:05,180
I would never have put my parents in one.

5349
05:12:05,180 --> 05:12:06,620
It's like such a hard balance

5350
05:12:06,620 --> 05:12:08,860
because to get at home health is not easy.

5351
05:12:08,860 --> 05:12:09,500
It's not cheap.

5352
05:12:09,500 --> 05:12:12,700
It's not even viable for a lot of people.

5353
05:12:12,700 --> 05:12:16,060
However, I think with the rise

5354
05:12:16,060 --> 05:12:18,700
of multi-generational households,

5355
05:12:19,340 --> 05:12:23,500
I think that is going to be a very lovely solution.

5356
05:12:25,180 --> 05:12:29,500
I would very much like to see in my lifetime

5357
05:12:29,500 --> 05:12:32,860
the rise of multi-generational households again

5358
05:12:32,860 --> 05:12:35,020
or very close-knit communities again.

5359
05:12:35,580 --> 05:12:37,100
Gardening, I'm going to see that picked up

5360
05:12:37,100 --> 05:12:39,340
so we start relying on the big supermarkets.

5361
05:12:40,140 --> 05:12:42,300
But anyway, before I put my tinfoil hat on,

5362
05:12:42,300 --> 05:12:44,380
how about we redirect into mimosa?

5363
05:12:44,380 --> 05:12:45,900
I'll get some food in my tum tum

5364
05:12:45,900 --> 05:12:49,100
and I will put up my membership ASMR stream

5365
05:12:49,100 --> 05:12:50,460
in 10 minutes time.

5366
05:12:50,460 --> 05:12:51,420
Give me 10 minutes.

5367
05:12:53,260 --> 05:12:55,660
Make a salt was, it was good.

5368
05:12:55,660 --> 05:12:58,700
I may have perished in the lava by accident.

5369
05:12:59,500 --> 05:13:03,660
And I also bumrushed the last mission, which didn't work.

5370
05:13:06,300 --> 05:13:07,180
Did you get your game?

5371
05:13:07,180 --> 05:13:10,300
No, the way I type in game and then how long?

5372
05:13:10,300 --> 05:13:12,220
So I literally type in mech assault, how long?

5373
05:13:12,220 --> 05:13:14,140
And I'm pretty sure if you type it in Google right now,

5374
05:13:14,140 --> 05:13:15,420
it says eight hours.

5375
05:13:15,420 --> 05:13:17,260
Oh my God, what happens if we type the same thing

5376
05:13:17,260 --> 05:13:18,620
on Google at the same time, right?

5377
05:13:18,620 --> 05:13:21,500
Mech assault, how long Google?

5378
05:13:23,820 --> 05:13:27,660
Main story, seven hours and 44 minutes.

5379
05:13:29,660 --> 05:13:31,340
Uh-huh, that's right.

5380
05:13:31,340 --> 05:13:34,620
And I did it in five, I think, roughly five.

5381
05:13:37,420 --> 05:13:40,220
There's a site called how long to be, exactly.

5382
05:13:40,220 --> 05:13:41,980
It's gonna be a membership tinfoil ASMR.

5383
05:13:41,980 --> 05:13:43,500
Honestly, it does may take me long.

5384
05:13:43,500 --> 05:13:45,180
It does may take me long to get started.

5385
05:13:46,060 --> 05:13:48,860
Okay, she's a gamer.

5386
05:13:48,860 --> 05:13:50,060
Oh my God, wait, what's this?

5387
05:13:50,060 --> 05:13:51,260
What's the speed run?

5388
05:13:52,140 --> 05:13:56,460
Mech assault, speed run, world, world record.

5389
05:13:57,420 --> 05:14:00,940
Let's see if my, can I be the first person to submit for it?

5390
05:14:04,460 --> 05:14:07,900
No, wait, I can be seventh place, shut up.

5391
05:14:09,980 --> 05:14:13,260
How can someone defeat the game in 59 minutes?

5392
05:14:14,300 --> 05:14:17,180
Whoever the fuck you are, elite two heroes,

5393
05:14:17,180 --> 05:14:19,260
I'm coming for your British ass.

5394
05:14:19,260 --> 05:14:22,380
Fucking 59 minutes, it took me five hours.

5395
05:14:22,380 --> 05:14:23,660
Right, I'm going for seventh place.

5396
05:14:23,660 --> 05:14:25,660
I'm gonna submit myself for mech assault, thanks.

5397
05:14:26,860 --> 05:14:29,820
And ironically making strongy cuttles right now on speedrun.com.

5398
05:14:32,460 --> 05:14:34,140
Speedrunners are insane.

5399
05:14:34,140 --> 05:14:36,860
Seventh place gamer, yay, I'm seventh place.

5400
05:14:36,860 --> 05:14:38,300
Let's go, seventh place.

5401
05:14:39,660 --> 05:14:40,860
I'm just glad we did it.

5402
05:14:41,500 --> 05:14:42,300
Let's go.

5403
05:14:42,300 --> 05:14:44,700
Oh, elite two, viewer has their YouTube video link.

5404
05:14:44,700 --> 05:14:47,340
Ah, I bet you're using cheats.

5405
05:14:47,340 --> 05:14:48,220
I'm gonna watch that.

5406
05:14:48,220 --> 05:14:49,100
I'm gonna be annoyed.

5407
05:14:49,100 --> 05:14:51,900
She's in the top, I'm top seventh on mech assault.

5408
05:14:53,420 --> 05:14:55,580
I'll tell my, I can tell my dad that.

5409
05:14:55,580 --> 05:14:56,300
Where's my phone?

5410
05:14:56,300 --> 05:14:57,500
Oh, my phone's not here.

5411
05:14:58,060 --> 05:15:00,860
I'll tell my dad that I got the seventh world record

5412
05:15:00,860 --> 05:15:02,700
on mech assault purely on the basis

5413
05:15:02,700 --> 05:15:04,380
that no one has submitted for it.

5414
05:15:06,540 --> 05:15:08,220
And then he'll be mega proud of me.

5415
05:15:10,460 --> 05:15:11,900
I just checked and it's seven.

5416
05:15:13,900 --> 05:15:15,100
Yeah, hell yeah.

5417
05:15:15,740 --> 05:15:19,100
Okay, right, before I continue yappening

5418
05:15:19,100 --> 05:15:20,380
all your ears off again.

5419
05:15:20,380 --> 05:15:21,980
So yeah, literally top 10, same top,

5420
05:15:21,980 --> 05:15:23,900
maybe I won't say seventh, I'll say top 10.

5421
05:15:23,900 --> 05:15:26,540
I'll be like, I'll talk, I'm top 10 speaker on record me,

5422
05:15:26,540 --> 05:15:27,340
but what do you mean?

5423
05:15:27,340 --> 05:15:29,740
And I'll be like, yes, well,

5424
05:15:31,020 --> 05:15:33,980
I'm gonna watch him take first place tomorrow, honestly.

5425
05:15:34,700 --> 05:15:36,860
He would probably do that way faster than me.

5426
05:15:38,220 --> 05:15:40,780
Right, as I said, I'm gonna end stream.

5427
05:15:40,780 --> 05:15:42,620
It's gonna redirect you into mimosa.

5428
05:15:42,620 --> 05:15:46,220
For those of you who are a member of Strony Cottle's channel,

5429
05:15:46,220 --> 05:15:48,860
I am about to take a 10 minute rest

5430
05:15:48,860 --> 05:15:50,380
to get some food in my belly.

5431
05:15:50,380 --> 05:15:52,940
And then we're gonna do membership ASMR.

5432
05:15:52,940 --> 05:15:54,460
And I'll get all booted up for that, okay?

5433
05:15:55,260 --> 05:15:58,460
So I will see you tomorrow for some Beltro,

5434
05:15:58,460 --> 05:15:59,660
which is two hours later,

5435
05:15:59,660 --> 05:16:03,260
or I will see you in 10 minutes for membership ASMR.

5436
05:16:03,260 --> 05:16:05,180
Thank you so so much for keeping me company

5437
05:16:05,180 --> 05:16:07,340
through an insane childhood game,

5438
05:16:07,340 --> 05:16:09,900
a childhood game, so childhoody,

5439
05:16:09,900 --> 05:16:13,340
that I actually wasn't even able to play it at the time

5440
05:16:13,340 --> 05:16:14,780
because I was so small and tiny.

5441
05:16:17,100 --> 05:16:21,180
Okay, imagine checking the speed runner list

5442
05:16:21,260 --> 05:16:24,940
and finding you lost to a watermelon cuttlefish, honestly.

5443
05:16:24,940 --> 05:16:25,820
Okay, right, bye-bye.

5444
05:16:25,820 --> 05:16:27,340
Thank you so much for the stream, Reflanks.

5445
05:16:27,340 --> 05:16:28,940
I'll see you very very shortly.

5446
05:16:28,940 --> 05:16:29,580
And have a nice day.

5447
05:16:29,580 --> 05:16:31,580
Remember to hydrate and eat and stretch

5448
05:16:31,580 --> 05:16:33,660
so you don't have any problems with your booty hole.

5449
05:16:33,660 --> 05:16:33,980
Okay?

5450
05:16:34,700 --> 05:16:35,980
Bye, Reflanks.

5451
05:16:35,980 --> 05:16:37,340
See you tomorrow.

5452
05:16:37,340 --> 05:16:38,140
Bye.

5453
05:16:43,580 --> 05:16:44,220
Are you gonna tongue it?

5454
05:16:46,380 --> 05:16:47,900
Imagine if I said goodbye like that.

5455
05:16:48,540 --> 05:16:52,220
Oh, my spit's going everywhere.

5456
05:16:52,220 --> 05:16:53,820
Sorry, I'm salivating.

5457
05:16:53,820 --> 05:16:54,620
Sorry.

5458
05:16:54,620 --> 05:16:55,260
Okay, bye.

5459
05:16:55,260 --> 05:16:57,100
See you on mimosa or see you in 10 minutes.
