00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, can you hear me?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,400
Tastin, Tastin, I'm currently holding in my hand right now because I need to be able

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:34,400
to police you down in between my thighs as an amazing thank you for the milestone.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,400
And I'm really appreciative for everyone who subscribes and likes and enjoys.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
And I just realized I'm wearing leggings.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,400
So this ASMR isn't going to work. I'm going to need to take these off.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I don't know if I should edit this part out.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm currently standing up in my recording bag and that does me lowering my leggings.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Don't tell YouTube, I think you just heard my ankle crack as well.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,400
That's my leggings around my ankles there.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Thank you very much for all of your support and I really appreciate it.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,400
And now I'm going to see if I can put you in between my legs.

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,400
How does this sound?

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Can you still hear me?

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Am I crushing you?

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm wondering. Actually, I might have to turn in this way in order to do it.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,400
But my thigh pudge is going on you.

18
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Ta-da!

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Can you still breathe?

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,400
As long as you can still breathe, that's the main thing.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,400
And you can tap out at any time.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Thomas!

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Does it sound like anything?

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Well, if you enjoy being in between my thighs,

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,400
then I'll just keep squishing you as a thank you.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:53,400
I don't know if my voice would be muffled at all in here.

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Or is this the part where I say thank you because you should be thanking me

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,400
for such an experience, shouldn't you?

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:25,400
You're so wonderfully loud.

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Did my thigh sound nice and soft?

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
See, that's my skin.

32
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
You can tap it around your ears as well.

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
See?

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,400
So my thigh is cupping your ear and if I tap my thigh fat,

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:58,400
it's getting picked up on the ear.

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:10,400
What a strange experience for you.

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm trying to see if you could hear my heartbeat through my thighs,

38
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:28,400
but I don't think my blood flow is as strong.

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Answer me this.

40
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Do you like being bloomy?

41
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I feel like it makes such a good belly.

42
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I can hate lopia because I have no strength in my arms or my wrists or my hands.

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Almost strength is in my legs.

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:10,400
So I can technically do this for as long as I like.

45
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:27,400
You can pretend to struggle and try and get away, but good luck with art.

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Good luck.

47
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm glad you're getting good at knowing your place.

48
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay, okay, I'll have a bit of a break.

49
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Can't be meaty all the time, that cannot, unless you like it.

50
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,400
That's different.

51
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Well, if you have no further objections, get back on your knees then.

52
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,400
How's that?

53
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Are you starting to realize where you should be in life?

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah, I've walked right in between my thighs.

55
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,400
This is surprisingly nice on the muscles we should do this again sometime.

56
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,400
If you're ever feeling, you know, a bit pathetic,

57
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,400
at least you know you're safe to explore that side of you with me.

58
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Because I don't judge.

59
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
No, not unless you want to.

60
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
That's different.

61
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Because then I can judge you very hard.

62
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Why?

63
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I think I will let you be.

64
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,400
And I'll stop talking over your experience, because I'll probably ruin it.

65
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I want you to get lost in your thoughts.

66
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,400
While I headlock you, okay?

67
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,400
You just let your mind run wild.

68
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,400
And think about all the scenarios.

69
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:50,400
And I'll say one last thing, that nothing is off limits.

70
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Then go by then, good boy.

71
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm sorry.

72
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm sorry.

73
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm sorry.

74
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm sorry.

75
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm sorry.

76
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm sorry.

77
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm sorry.

78
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm sorry.

80
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm sorry.

82
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm sorry.

83
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm sorry.

84
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
I'm sorry.

86
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm sorry.

87
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm sorry.

88
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm sorry.

89
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm sorry.

90
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm sorry.

91
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm sorry.

92
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm sorry.
