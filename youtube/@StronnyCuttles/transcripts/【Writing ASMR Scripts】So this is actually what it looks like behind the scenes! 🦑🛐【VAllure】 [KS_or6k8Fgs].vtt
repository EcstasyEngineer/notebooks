WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.360
I don't know how to put me, I don't know if I should put myself in the middle or not.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
This link's awful!

00:15.360 --> 00:18.360
I don't know how to do it though, right?

00:18.360 --> 00:23.240
I honestly don't know how to do it but we're doing it, we're doing it, it's fine, we'll

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
get there.

00:25.240 --> 00:29.240
Wow, hi momay, hi replays!

00:29.240 --> 00:33.240
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, we thought you forgot us.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.760
No, you know for a fact, I take like two freaking minutes to get my coffee tea, I've got a hot

00:37.760 --> 00:42.240
water bottle with me today, I don't know if you can hear me, give a good spank.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.240
I've got a hot water bottle on my tummy.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
Hi!

00:46.240 --> 00:49.740
Are you ready?

00:49.740 --> 00:54.540
I was killed more than five minutes ago, I'm able to carry you again, let's go!

00:54.540 --> 00:58.620
We aren't even going to play Elden Ring until like, I don't know, maybe August when we put

00:58.620 --> 01:00.740
up Elden Ring again.

01:00.740 --> 01:06.740
But good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

01:06.740 --> 01:16.860
Today I'm going to show you the secret to making money, a good old ASMR collab, okay?

01:16.860 --> 01:23.860
So on today's agendination, okay, I am going to write one-on-one collabs with none other

01:23.860 --> 01:29.060
than the members of Vehler and Dolj, and before you're like, when do these drop, relax,

01:29.060 --> 01:36.100
I've not even finished writing the damn thing, okay, relax, I don't want to see, when is

01:36.100 --> 01:43.220
it, when does it drop, one, Amy's away on holiday, right, relax, two, AC's voice is

01:43.220 --> 01:49.740
fucked, three, Mary's trying to move out, fucking, five, wait, no, four, Azura, Azura's

01:49.740 --> 01:57.420
trying to move out, five, she be, she be fucking on Elden Ring, okay, she's doing endurance.

01:57.420 --> 02:00.340
These girls ain't going to drop everything to get this shit done, it doesn't have to

02:00.340 --> 02:07.020
be done right now, relax, I got ASMRs coming out of the wazoo, relax, okay, ooh, oh shit,

02:07.100 --> 02:16.100
okay, I've already decided what mine and Amy's plot is, so I can just write out little,

02:16.100 --> 02:21.100
well, I would actually be big sister, I'm also so big sister, because it's going on

02:21.100 --> 02:27.740
my channel, so it's big sister and, like, the fancy and sign, nah, that's awful, and

02:27.740 --> 02:34.340
little sister tingle you to sleep, that would be mine and Amy's plot, because if you didn't

02:34.340 --> 02:40.620
know, if I had a lighter voice, it'd be fucking over for you lollipop lovers, your fucking

02:40.620 --> 02:45.780
dick would explode, I'm doing a big sister and little sister club with Denpo, fuck,

02:45.780 --> 02:55.380
fuck, right, okay, new plan, new plan, new plan, new plan, right, shit, I can't do a

02:55.380 --> 03:05.340
lighter voice, do I, do I do two little sisters tingle you, fuck, what do I do, what do I

03:05.340 --> 03:13.340
do, of course I fucking accidentally guessed what you're doing with someone else, shit,

03:13.340 --> 03:19.380
who's the big sister, you're both wee, it's okay, it's step sister, so I can make it real

03:19.380 --> 03:26.380
sisters for this one, aye, I knew it, yeah, I knew it, picture, right, that's amazing,

03:26.380 --> 03:34.380
right, okay, we're doing, we're doing real big sister and real little sister, obviously

03:34.380 --> 03:37.980
it makes no fucking sense, because one of us was randomly Scottish on the plot, but

03:37.980 --> 03:47.980
hey ho, totally real for real for real, A.C., A.C. and Snowberries, thank you for joining

03:47.980 --> 03:53.780
A.C. and Snowberries, I'm currently writing down the name of the plots that I'm forcing

03:53.780 --> 03:58.580
the Vila members to create with me at a later date, right now, not right now, not right

03:58.580 --> 04:03.980
now, that's what I'm trying to say, I've still pinned that I'm not live yet, but there's

04:03.980 --> 04:10.460
a short on, Emmys rats, actually it was a really good short, girl friend and step sister,

04:10.460 --> 04:21.820
of course, could we get away with that? I'm tempted, anonymous, hold on a minute, hold

04:21.820 --> 04:31.100
on a minute, I'm kind of tempted, does the notification come up for that? That is kind

04:31.100 --> 04:38.220
of genius, I feel like it's really taking the, I don't know, I'll put in brackets, I think

04:38.220 --> 04:45.380
we're getting really fucking cruel, so I don't know how cheeky I'm feeling, step sister,

04:45.380 --> 04:52.820
tingle, yum, I'll put in brackets that, okay, now for me and A.C., this is just an excuse

04:52.820 --> 04:58.300
for me to get A.C. commissioned in a schoolgirl outfit, I'm sorry, I said what, I said Snowberries,

04:58.300 --> 05:04.700
I don't give a fuck, okay, I wanted to do something like, it's an after school club,

05:04.700 --> 05:12.420
and we're all three of us are forced into making this after school club, so we qualify

05:12.420 --> 05:17.380
for the school not being mad at us for not doing an after school club, and then basically

05:17.380 --> 05:23.580
we're like, well, well, it literally sounds park like, well, what are we doing there? What

05:23.580 --> 05:32.300
are we doing there? And then it's just like, ooh, let's go through your phone, oh my god,

05:32.300 --> 05:45.300
you freak of nature, wait, nature, you nasty boy, what is this? It's ASMR, oh my god, oh

05:45.300 --> 05:57.420
my god, the shock, the horror, the lag deli, I'm basically a retinkler, right, so what's

05:57.420 --> 06:06.860
that called? Is it Tussanderis? Tussanderis, wait, Tussanderis, find out, you like tingles,

06:06.860 --> 06:14.620
so it's like alliteration, Tussanderis, detect, fuck, this has got a T in it, Tussanderis,

06:14.620 --> 06:22.780
detect you, get tingles, it's a marker, wait, what's the T word that begins with detect,

06:22.780 --> 06:34.500
to find out, to sleuth, wait, no, not the delay, I can't imagine AC as a Tussander, Tussanderis,

06:34.500 --> 06:43.700
trace you, trace, trace you, get tingles, it's like, shut the fuck up, this is awful, Tussanderis

06:43.700 --> 06:50.740
with an S, okay, that's all right, that's so scoff, right, okay, the next, I'll highlight

06:50.860 --> 06:56.020
it in, I'll outline it in red so you guys can see what we're probably gonna work on,

06:56.020 --> 06:59.620
thank you again anonymous for that tip, I've never even thanked ya, I was just like, thanks

06:59.620 --> 07:06.420
anonymous for the idea, mine, as if you didn't just give me your worldly money, triangulate,

07:06.420 --> 07:15.660
wait, Tussanderis, triangulate, stop, that's so funny, that you get tingles, that you get

07:15.660 --> 07:21.740
tingles, okay, that's good, I'm taking that, right, mercy, should I pick mercy, oh sugar,

07:21.740 --> 07:26.140
I'm in the way a little bit, hold on, I'm sorry chat, chat, can my hair go on you a little bit,

07:28.140 --> 07:34.620
it was mercy to geese practice their honking ASMR, honestly, I uploaded a short that someone made,

07:35.260 --> 07:41.340
that short that was made was someone's submission that they're good enough to edit, like shorts in

07:41.420 --> 07:46.940
general, and management sent it on to me and I was like, wait, who edited that, because that's

07:46.940 --> 07:50.620
not in the editing style of who got on board, and they were like, no, this is someone submitting

07:50.620 --> 07:54.620
themselves to be an editor, and I'm like, wait, they did this for free, like, obviously we paid

07:54.620 --> 08:01.100
them, but it's very rare to ever get an example of work, via an actual example of work on your

08:01.100 --> 08:06.620
content, so yeah, smell the laughter, I'm already right, what are we doing with the yandere, are

08:06.620 --> 08:14.380
we becoming yandere too, I really wish it wasn't offensive, but obviously both me and

08:14.380 --> 08:19.180
mercy's lore eventually you perish in it, and it would be kind of funny to do like a you perish

08:19.180 --> 08:26.060
in the end of it, Scottish, Scottish laughter, I don't have an accent when I'm Scottish laughing,

08:26.060 --> 08:34.380
that doesn't make sense, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what the, no, that's not a thing,

08:34.780 --> 08:44.540
you want to hear yandere lines with a Scottish accent, I thought you said that I was your yandere,

08:44.540 --> 08:50.300
wait, how about what, like two yandere's confused on who the real, no, because then we're like

08:50.300 --> 08:54.380
arguing with each other, that's not relaxing, both of us are like, listen up you slag,

08:55.340 --> 09:00.380
this is how the facts are, see that guy right there, he belongs to me, I'm the yandere in this

09:00.380 --> 09:06.860
situation, no, that's not going to put anyone to sleep, okay, let us tingle, no, it's not going

09:06.860 --> 09:14.940
to put anyone to sleep, two girls make you comfy until the darkness, oh, okay, some of you have

09:14.940 --> 09:24.060
your tastes, we're not quite there, ASMR Viking funeral, oh my god, oh wait, how about a sleep aid,

09:24.060 --> 09:32.380
hear me out, a sleep aid, but it's yanderefied, okay, so yandere tied up, sleep aid, and I'll get

09:32.380 --> 09:40.780
an artwork of you being tethered to me and mercy in bed, and like, it's like basement, like ambience,

09:40.780 --> 09:45.020
ASMR, you can hear it's like breathing in your ear, and we're doing like some sleep talking, we're like,

09:45.660 --> 09:51.740
oh you senpai, you're always ours, whatever, like that kind of thing, so like you can hear like

09:51.740 --> 09:57.100
basement jingle, and then like the little furnace goes on in the corner, because that's where the

09:57.100 --> 10:03.660
furnace thingy is kept in a house, I don't know, two yandere's take care of their pet human, that's

10:03.660 --> 10:10.700
actually gonna most likely end up in more clicks, so let me just steal that too, yandere's, I've lost

10:10.700 --> 10:19.340
it, two yandere's take care of the pet human, okay, and then sheepsters, this is not sheepsters,

10:19.340 --> 10:31.500
this is azura, right, azura was going to be a sleep aid as well, but my problem is the artwork,

10:31.500 --> 10:37.660
I wanted to get artwork where you are embraced by the both of us at a certain location,

10:38.220 --> 10:49.260
two crazy cultists, for me and merchie, two mommies, yandere flashes, oh sorry,

10:49.260 --> 10:52.540
sorry, I just made that word up, but there's not even, hold on, I'm gonna drink my tea,

10:52.540 --> 11:00.780
because it's gonna get cold, if azura embraces us, she embraces you too technically, honestly,

11:00.780 --> 11:04.780
I get swallowed up alongside, I'd be like, hold on a minute, aren't I supposed to be doing the

11:04.940 --> 11:11.900
freaking tingling, goddesses, fuck it, let's both be goddesses, I'll get myself drawn with

11:11.900 --> 11:29.500
like body paint and that, goddesses, like sleep aid ASMR, sleep aid ASMR, oh no, thank you Oregon

11:29.500 --> 11:34.220
for the vibe, wait do you guys actually want yandere's Scottish ASMR, like a solo, I'll do it,

11:34.860 --> 11:40.300
what did you say, if I find out you're fucking cheating Senpai, I'll kick your fucking cunt in,

11:40.300 --> 11:48.380
honestly, you want that, okay, okay, okay, I'll gie you, I'll gie you, let me kick, let me kick,

11:51.100 --> 11:55.180
I would have to whisper it so fast though, I'll be like, I'm gonna fucking kick that cunt in,

11:55.180 --> 11:58.460
I swear I'm going Senpai, you're supposed to only be for me, so where the fuck is

11:58.460 --> 12:01.100
I'm gonna go in your social media, I can see you following all these other

12:03.260 --> 12:08.540
like, I would have to whisper it so fast, should I do that, like the fastest whisper, like yandere

12:08.540 --> 12:15.180
Scottish ASMR, like a muster, mommy being mean to us, oh I'm not normally mean but, goddess is

12:16.220 --> 12:25.740
pamper, goddess is pamper, they're servant to sleep ASMR, I don't know, okay, as long as it's a

12:25.740 --> 12:30.940
work in progress, don't wait, who goes there, identify yourself, are you squiddin' me right now,

12:30.940 --> 12:39.180
a goat goddess and a sea goddess, Brian, wow Brian, you said that so fast, I don't know why

12:39.180 --> 12:44.380
my brain couldn't really keep up, thank you for your love for the five, how about that, I don't,

12:45.260 --> 12:55.180
so lower wise that doesn't make any sense, because as there is your mohen, does your,

12:55.180 --> 13:03.980
does every audio have to be whispers, no, but if I'm like straight up bit posting then I do,

13:03.980 --> 13:08.620
I do like to say it's not ASMR, but if we are gonna slap ASMR, you can do soft spoken ASMR,

13:08.620 --> 13:15.580
that's actually true, very true, Freya did fantastic soft spoken ASMR collab, that's coming out

13:15.580 --> 13:27.660
soon TM, oh be friends, I got an eight hour sleep, because I hired a maid, so my location

13:27.660 --> 13:33.340
is in a disarray and I don't want my dad to see it before he comes over, so I had to stay awake

13:34.140 --> 13:41.020
for this lovely maid to come over and I was passing out in my little gamer chair, I was like

13:41.020 --> 13:45.500
when you're finished please just come on through, I'm just doing some work,

13:48.060 --> 13:54.620
and yeah she likes me, because she said you've clearly never hired a maid before,

13:55.980 --> 14:00.140
I don't know, I don't know if I said this story from last time or not, I can't remember,

14:00.140 --> 14:07.260
but basically are we talking asmongold room untidy, no, no, no food, no mold, none of this stuff,

14:07.260 --> 14:13.900
just like it's a mess and I need help type stuff, a normal maid or a naughty maid, well considering

14:13.900 --> 14:19.420
the host is clean, I'm gonna say a normal maid, she being strongly tried to lure you into the

14:19.420 --> 14:25.180
respective domains, Wonderland or sorry, oh what would you pick, a nice warm hotel or a cold,

14:25.180 --> 14:33.980
freezing cold cave, even I'm picking Wonderland, but where will the rats live, it's any who has

14:33.980 --> 14:40.700
rats, are you saying for me to get a pet rat, I wish I could get a pet rat but they have very

14:40.700 --> 14:49.020
limited lifespans and I can't handle it, I cannot handle it, you picking the cave because of hypnosis,

14:49.020 --> 14:53.500
okay right sheepsters, right me and a rabbit, what would me and a rabbit do when we get together

14:53.580 --> 15:00.380
is the question, hmm, wait I'm halfway finished with tea, what would me and she be do, hmm,

15:03.340 --> 15:11.900
office worker, you want like an office worker meme, HR training ASMR, oh my god it will go like

15:11.900 --> 15:20.860
completely meme route, HR, you have to be HR trained ASMR, question mark or is that two Mimi,

15:21.820 --> 15:27.500
double domination is fun, goddess is reward and somnatic followers for their devotion to

15:27.500 --> 15:34.780
sleep ASMR, oh this is good, when you collab with Mercy do the mickey mouse, no, it's because I can't

15:34.780 --> 15:43.580
do Mercy's voice, don't do ironic jokeies, no do I run, don't, I run a jokeies one, two office ladies

15:43.580 --> 15:49.660
and you do overtime, that sounds like an alternative plot line I'm gonna be honest, how do I make it

15:49.660 --> 15:54.940
back to wholesome, the only way I can make that back to wholesome hold on

15:54.940 --> 16:01.100
angel and devil on your shoulders, one whispers negative affirmations, the other whispers positive

16:01.100 --> 16:08.460
affirmations, that is so mean, because then who's the bad guy, I can be your angel or your devil,

16:09.500 --> 16:13.740
ASMR, I mean on shibi made like that because she mentioned the meme,

16:14.620 --> 16:20.780
shibi a baddie, thank you so much Anonymous for the tip,

16:21.980 --> 16:25.340
wait I just stole something what did I steal, it's so tiny what did I steal,

16:26.460 --> 16:31.660
hold on let me let me make it big and let me make it readable, nope that was a highlight I

16:31.660 --> 16:36.860
didn't mean to do that, hold on wait hold on, I'll show you this, two office ladies and you do

16:36.860 --> 16:42.700
overtime, right now let's, if I was to expand on this one this is quite easy to do because it

16:42.700 --> 16:53.020
would be the classic, oh my god you look so tired XD and then that's when you confess you have not

16:53.020 --> 17:07.500
slipping at all and then we go oh no we must help for you at once, ASMR continues, listener falls

17:08.140 --> 17:20.780
a sweep, no a sweep, all is good in the world, amen, that would be how that plot would go,

17:20.780 --> 17:28.860
if we did too, I think HR trained, I think HR trained is more of a meme solo plot to be honest

17:28.860 --> 17:41.180
that's not really although, decisions how I want them all, I can't get them, I want to eat the whole

17:41.180 --> 17:53.660
cake, I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing, anyone listen to Borg or, oh it's been a many a year,

17:53.660 --> 17:58.860
you can't keep doing overtime if you aren't well rested, okay okay yeah yeah because we're still

17:58.860 --> 18:05.660
we're still office kind of things in here, okay okay this, I know it looks terrible, just relax,

18:05.660 --> 18:12.540
relax, okay so we've got the ideas done about what we're gonna type okay so and then we just get

18:12.540 --> 18:18.060
let's get to it, so basically break them up, break them up, give them a little room, give them a

18:18.060 --> 18:25.020
little space, so this is what actually happens behind the scenes, so just pretend I am sending

18:25.020 --> 18:32.380
Emmy a script okay, so this is what Emmy will see, first thing she will be greeted by is the title

18:32.380 --> 18:39.020
of the plot so she understands what kind of thing is about to go down, now if you really want you

18:39.020 --> 18:45.100
can also give a premise, I don't necessarily always write a premise but because the title's so

18:45.100 --> 18:51.500
explanatory there's no need for it, this is the key part okay, this is the key part

18:53.100 --> 18:57.260
and you're not ready for it, I write this in every collab script and it doesn't work

19:00.060 --> 19:04.860
please, well we're not going to do it at this, oh maybe we should please

19:05.180 --> 19:16.860
whisper through the whole script, now I know this might seem crazy to have this so big and so

19:16.860 --> 19:22.060
center, I cannot tell you how many collab scripts I've sent away, what is this, are you explaining

19:22.060 --> 19:27.740
your job, I am showing you how to make infinite money glitch on YouTube, you're welcome

19:28.060 --> 19:38.940
so this always gets ignored without fail and it's fine, I'm used to it, so if I ever get a

19:38.940 --> 19:50.140
script back and like I'm whispering but the other person isn't, it always happens, it's fine, I'm

19:50.140 --> 19:54.780
used to it, I don't get mad or anything, I don't ask the girl to redo the lines either because it

19:54.780 --> 20:01.820
takes a lot of time especially when really in this exchange the only exchange happening is like

20:01.820 --> 20:07.500
hey can I put an ASMR on my YouTube channel so the exchange isn't that good of an exchange rate

20:07.500 --> 20:15.260
okay, please whisper, well you want me to whisper right now or do you mean like I like begging them

20:15.900 --> 20:22.940
so normally you are supposed to start off your own script by yourself to have the guest, the guest

20:22.940 --> 20:30.140
person that is going to show up on your channel start is not wrong, it's not a negative if they

20:30.140 --> 20:37.740
do, I mean heck the plot might evolve quite well if you were to but you want to give your collab

20:37.740 --> 20:44.620
partner less work than what you do, that makes sense, you know if you're going for a straight 50-50

20:44.620 --> 20:52.540
on words then sure go for it but you never really want to make them in the trouble, Dumbledore said

20:52.700 --> 20:58.140
can't we, hi, did you put your name in a cup? okay so

21:01.420 --> 21:05.500
okay I've almost finished my tea, there's a bubble in my tea, I must have put a bubble in it

21:09.500 --> 21:17.260
Dr. Crush tries to give you migraine relief, Dr. Crush, get it, reindeer listener

21:18.140 --> 21:25.020
what does that mean? ASMR is begging you to whisper in a collab ASMR please, please read the start

21:25.020 --> 21:27.580
oh actually I should explain the difference between

21:28.380 --> 21:35.020
me, it's strongy, here is the new collab script, the title is we kiss and make out for 10 minutes

21:35.020 --> 21:43.260
straight, let me know what you think, anonymous, one you're wrong for that, two that's hilarious

21:43.900 --> 21:53.260
that's terrible, that's terrible, no you cannot send a script away asking for 10 minutes of kissing

21:53.260 --> 22:01.660
sounds okay and then call it ASMR, you'll get limited ads and it'll be suppressed like heck

22:01.660 --> 22:06.940
although it'd be really funny to do like six girls kissing ASMR and then when you click on it I was

22:06.940 --> 22:12.780
like careful you're not to jerk your pintas to death or something right strongy right what's the

22:12.780 --> 22:18.300
plot real big sister and real little sister tingly asleep right what are we doing are we creeping

22:18.300 --> 22:27.100
into your bedroom or do you give us a cheeky text saying you can't sleep or are we already in your

22:27.100 --> 22:33.500
bedroom or do we need to make our way to your bedroom slurping raman ASMR feed the void what

22:33.500 --> 22:41.500
it wants mother and the fire everyone please kiss throughout the whole script 10 minutes

22:41.500 --> 22:50.620
okay we're gonna creep into the bedroom okay so i'm gonna remind emmy remember we have to be super

22:51.580 --> 22:58.140
dooper quiet we're not supposed to be out of bed right now but

22:59.500 --> 23:06.060
however wait okay wait remember we have to be super super quiet oh actually here's an example so

23:06.060 --> 23:11.340
this is just me regularly talking you can start an ASMR regularly talking but then you can also

23:11.340 --> 23:17.020
do what's called soft spoken ASMR when you're the thumb in your voice is still present so you see

23:17.020 --> 23:24.780
that uh that's what i call thumb from skyrim uh you can continue to do that with soft spoken so

23:24.780 --> 23:31.260
i can get closer to you but you can still hear the uh and my voice this is soft spoken ASMR

23:31.260 --> 23:36.380
that's how it'd be and then whispering ASMR when there is no thumb present in your voice at all

23:36.380 --> 23:43.580
you hear the uh when i whisper what do you know there's absolutely no well i would have to retake

23:43.580 --> 23:49.580
that line for example but as i whisper and there should be no thumb present i constantly have to

23:49.580 --> 23:56.940
retake lines when i whisper because i have quite a voice so yeah little sister breaks down your

23:56.940 --> 24:03.180
door remember we have to be super dooper quiet we're not supposed to be out of bed right now

24:03.740 --> 24:15.420
i don't want to i don't want to get caught because i'll i'll end up getting more chores just to

24:15.420 --> 24:24.060
really set the whole our parents are asleep in bed plot okay i don't want to end up getting more

24:24.060 --> 24:30.860
chores i don't want to get caught because i'll end up getting more chores uh as their fucking birds

24:30.860 --> 24:38.380
are going wild um i want to get caught because i'll end up getting more chores does that make sense

24:39.420 --> 24:44.460
wait hold on let me recalibrate remember we have to be super dooper quiet we're not

24:44.460 --> 24:49.580
supposed to be at bed right now i don't want to get caught because is it because i've said

24:49.580 --> 24:57.020
a slang term which is because i'll end up getting more chores you you always get a waste

24:57.580 --> 25:03.020
is it scott free get it because i'm scottish oh shit is my soundboard not up hold on

25:04.300 --> 25:10.140
shit my soundboard hold on pause right was it stream deck hold on hold on hold that thought

25:10.140 --> 25:13.740
what was the joke i've already forgotten it right i'm ready i'm ready for the joke um

25:15.020 --> 25:17.740
you always get a waste scott free get it because i'm scottish

25:18.540 --> 25:24.140

i don't want to be like because i'm because i'm the parents favorite no that's not nice

25:43.740 --> 25:46.860
let's not say that i mean um you're the only one laughing here

25:49.340 --> 25:57.100
what do you mean that joke was terrible it's funny because scott is uh both a noun and a verb

25:57.980 --> 26:06.060
yeah a verb is a doing word a noun is a naming word an adjective is a describing word there you go

26:06.620 --> 26:11.180
a little bit of english for you that's how i remember you always get a waste scott free

26:11.820 --> 26:19.580
it's because i know exactly what to say and what they want to hear

26:20.220 --> 26:25.500
because emi's so emi's a wee smartical thing it's because i know exactly what to say and

26:25.500 --> 26:34.220
what they want to hear you have to think past what they immediately want you to do

26:35.020 --> 26:46.620

couldn't have made it any thinner if they wanted to uh i simply borrowed them pulls out a hammer

33:40.780 --> 33:47.500
to beat you with i mean emmy probably could make that uh idea how about instead of having a tough

33:47.500 --> 33:51.900

33:51.900 --> 33:59.340

have even better news a lot of embers found some tools that could be really useful putting it

34:02.620 --> 34:14.700
asleep what do you think what what do you mean where did i get them from stop it no she's not

34:14.700 --> 34:23.740
gonna batter them but well what do you mean where did i get them from i sourced them i sourced them

34:25.180 --> 34:35.500
was it ethically eth ethically you don't have to worry so much about me brother

34:36.300 --> 34:43.660
brother fuck macho man rendy savage you're in here with me brother you don't stand a chance

34:43.660 --> 34:50.220
against the tingles i like the way you think emmy's a little thief she's a mischievous little thing

34:50.220 --> 34:57.740
okay big brother are you implying i i procured them through scrupulous unscrupulous means

34:57.740 --> 35:02.460
should i do that should i make emmy's words like really articulate and then mine just like basic

35:02.460 --> 35:08.620
slang are you mean where did i get i sourced them ethically okay wait hold on i just like

35:08.700 --> 35:13.980
straight up yonk to sentence ah that's the only thing i hate about yonkin sentences is for some

35:13.980 --> 35:20.220
reason it does not like it are you implying are you implying that i produced them through

35:20.220 --> 35:27.340
unscrupulous means you don't have to worry so much about me brother laughter see so i can't

35:27.340 --> 35:31.980
replicate a laugh for any of the girls so when i give them like a bracket like that they must

35:31.980 --> 35:38.460
follow it or it gets completely taken out of the script um obviously i can't go like i don't

35:38.460 --> 35:45.820
know where the fuck emmy laughs like i think she goes i think she's a bit like that ethically

35:45.820 --> 35:51.660
sourcents unethically someone cringe greedy streamer versus giga chad buy yourself food mummy

35:55.340 --> 36:01.180
i acquired them from a generous patron yes the fact she is even little makes it hilarious

36:01.180 --> 36:08.940
she's a wrestling fan please do ASMR like that snapping into a slim gym it's macho man randy

36:08.940 --> 36:14.780
savage that my voice would be gone within a millisecond but you don't have to worry so much

36:14.780 --> 36:23.980
about me brother okay so the good thing about this kind of ASMR is it really doesn't have to be that

36:23.980 --> 36:29.660
long at all hold on let's get that let's get that word count in so we've got 83 words do you know what

36:29.660 --> 36:38.860
that means it means almost two minutes of dialogue i'll teach you a little trick so 100 words normally

36:38.860 --> 36:46.140
equals one minute of dialogue but there's an exception to this rule which is whispering

36:46.140 --> 36:53.340
whispering extends dialogue dramatically it it completely flips it on its head because when

36:53.340 --> 36:58.780
you whisper duggle remember we have to be super duper quiet we're not supposed to be out of bed

36:58.780 --> 37:04.940
right now i don't want to be no that's not relaxing strongy hold on that's not relaxing so i have to

37:04.940 --> 37:15.020
go remember let's be super duper quiet okay we're not supposed to be out of bed right now which is

37:15.020 --> 37:19.580
a lot faster than going remember we've got to be super duper quiet we're not supposed to be out of

37:19.580 --> 37:26.380
bed right now okay so whispering is always an exception to the the unwritten rule that normally

37:26.380 --> 37:32.780
a hundred words equals a minute whispering extends yes completely it means you need to add more big

37:32.780 --> 37:41.740
brother findom appreciators and shambles thankfully i don't care for findom yeah i'm not i need to yeah

37:42.460 --> 37:50.780
yeah remember remember the 5th of november we're gonna blow up parliament uh i was out of context

37:50.780 --> 37:58.620
for the 5th of november um that is a memorial date where guy fox's plot failed uh some nations

37:58.620 --> 38:05.980
celebrate the failure other nations scorned uh like to celebrate the attempt um but you know

38:05.980 --> 38:12.060
that is just how easy it is what it is strongy's plot this girlfriend begs you for five dollars so

38:12.060 --> 38:18.940
she can gamble on on voucher room honestly felt that right we're not doing i see i see you pop down

38:18.940 --> 38:22.700
there we're not doing you right now okay right whispering what do you mean where did i get them

38:22.700 --> 38:26.940
from are you implying i produced them through unscrupulous means you don't have to worry about

38:26.940 --> 38:35.100
me so you don't have to worry so much about me big brother laughter you know you know i can take care

38:36.140 --> 38:46.460
myself you view no i see who emi's like emi's this but i see who you know ten out of ten

38:46.460 --> 38:52.780
impression we were robbed of the good ending guy fox mentioned live on stream emi yanked them

38:52.780 --> 38:59.100
from her pay piggies in school oh my god do you think emi would do that emi would have like some

38:59.340 --> 39:02.460
em instead of like giving your lunch money

39:04.700 --> 39:14.460
feeling give me this right okay um i just realized oh no it's too big hold on there we go

39:18.060 --> 39:28.700
you know i can take care of myself now why don't you get comfy and we can have a sleep over as well

39:28.780 --> 39:34.220
tonight i don't care if we get in trouble again

39:36.780 --> 39:45.900
i never sleep better unless it's all three of us together oh my god emi with the heart of gold right

39:47.580 --> 39:51.420
okay emi's got a heart of gold right next unfortunately i'm gonna have to do it like this

39:51.500 --> 39:58.940
stronzo emi's i was actually gonna write emi's um so now that we've kind of set up the plot

39:59.980 --> 40:04.460
so again i'll just kind of quickly go over it so this is what emi's gonna see when i send her

40:04.460 --> 40:08.860
she's not gonna see all of this like notes this is like this is a different document i'll send her

40:08.860 --> 40:13.980
a different google doc link so she's gonna see the title she's gonna see please whisper please i'm on

40:13.980 --> 40:21.820
minis um so we're in we're talking in the middle of the microphone here um i'll just put a little

40:21.820 --> 40:26.620
middle i mean i think emi's pretty familiar with how i write scripts at this point in time i mean

40:26.620 --> 40:30.700
they all are because they were forced to use my terrible scripts for a little while but thank

40:30.700 --> 40:38.140
god they don't have to anymore um so the plot is we're outside your room um we noticed we don't

40:38.140 --> 40:45.660
want to get caught because parents bad um but emi's got some tools and knows how to get it because

40:45.660 --> 40:50.300
she's just so amazing she knows how to get out and then we go inside your room right now brian

40:51.180 --> 40:59.580
and she's gonna see let's make out for 10 minutes brian no anonymous no we're not gonna make out

40:59.580 --> 41:05.580
the freaking title the title is real big sister and real little sister

41:06.540 --> 41:13.580
and on you've got some tastes she says as she created emi in her own image you've got some

41:13.580 --> 41:23.500
jet you've got some tastes okay now here's the fun part here's the fun part so we've set up the

41:23.500 --> 41:29.420
plot we're in bed we're all gonna sleep together right so i'll actually i'm gonna ask emi for

41:29.420 --> 41:37.660
five minutes of soft breathing five minutes of soft breathing in the ear ASMR please but don't

41:37.660 --> 41:47.340
do like too much breathing that it becomes ear breathing ear blowing ASMR you know what i mean

41:47.340 --> 41:52.300
emi oh i just realized you can't hardly see that there you know what i mean emi there you can

41:52.300 --> 41:57.500
kind of see there that ain't move over but i don't want to be like humping chat well hold on a minute

41:58.060 --> 42:06.780
okay spoke a little bit too soon um right so this is me asking emi for soft breathing because

42:06.780 --> 42:12.700
at the end we're both gonna pass out okay um strong so you too i need five minutes soft

42:12.700 --> 42:18.700
breathing but i know what i mean when i say that so it doesn't come you don't okay let's compromise

42:18.700 --> 42:25.980
for six minutes of making out this is terrible right this is where the fun part comes in what

42:26.140 --> 42:33.260
what do you what tingles do you want us to do to you hmm or do you want us to do tingles at the

42:33.260 --> 42:40.220
same time so like i'll do like i don't know ear cupping and then emi's like i'll do finger fluttering

42:40.220 --> 42:46.460
you want hair brushing how about hair brushing and hair play we can do like two at the same time

42:48.060 --> 42:51.980
or do you want one ear difference like for example i can do ear tapping and then emi can do ear

42:52.700 --> 42:59.340
blowing um and then i can do like i don't know scrunching something against your ear i mean there's

42:59.340 --> 43:05.500
a few but if you want safer work how about sniffing brav sniffing is the market's limited ads any kind

43:05.500 --> 43:11.180
of fucking breathing orientated shite is like getting absolutely hammered right now i think it

43:11.180 --> 43:19.020
should be one at a time okay you want one at a time should we do should we do dual wheeled heartbeat

43:19.020 --> 43:30.620
oh uh uh dual wheeled heartbeat somewhere though i don't know oh it'd be fun if you did hair

43:30.620 --> 43:35.820
brushing and hair play at the same time warm breathing into our ears as if our ears were

43:35.820 --> 43:43.100
cold and you had to warm them up like that is that what you want you want golem i'm joking i

43:43.100 --> 43:50.380
know what you mean thank you anonymous okay um right i'll do warm breathing uh ear ASMR

43:51.260 --> 43:59.340
i'll get emi's to do cold blowing which is it right i don't know if we'll finally stop talking at

43:59.340 --> 44:09.340
this point hold on uh right let me just think uh right i never sleep better unless it's all three

44:09.340 --> 44:15.740
of us together i want to be like you're such a souk emi but i don't think you guys say souk the

44:15.740 --> 44:22.140
way we say souk if i say to emi you're such a souk it just means she really likes her big brother

44:22.780 --> 44:26.940
which is my little brother in the plot because i'm the big sister yeah you're i don't think you

44:26.940 --> 44:32.940
say souk in anywhere else but it basically just means that emi really likes brother

44:33.500 --> 44:39.340
rare metro man randy savage a souk a sucker no em a souk means

44:41.180 --> 44:45.500
it's like slang for you you just really like them i've never heard of the word souk right

44:45.500 --> 44:51.180
let's take that out then because literally no one's gonna get it um you're such a i don't want to be

44:51.180 --> 44:56.700
like the word doesn't suck up that's not the word it's that's a different word souk sounds different

44:57.500 --> 45:00.940
here what do you think of some fabric sounds i don't mean in the naughty way but like a blanket

45:00.940 --> 45:06.780
oh yeah yeah blanket rustling ASMR yeah i've got that um brocon would be better no no that's that's

45:06.780 --> 45:13.580
not how it works both you and emi warm breathing first then both you and emi cold breathing after

45:16.700 --> 45:24.060
i mean i can get that dude uh the only problem is it's gonna come be a bit of a headache for emi

45:24.060 --> 45:27.180
if i'm asking her to do all these different sound effects

45:29.820 --> 45:35.020
all right hold on what is an anonymous one uh thank you for the tip uh both you and emi want

45:35.020 --> 45:40.060
warm breathing right okay fuck it we'll do warm breathing together take that out you you're such a

45:40.060 --> 45:45.660
emi okay good sense you want to try again maybe i don't know have a have another shot okay first

45:45.660 --> 45:58.380
we are going to warm your ears up cut because i can already tell you're freezing in here that's why

45:58.380 --> 46:13.260
it's it's better we stick together because because because more strongy that's why it's better we

46:13.260 --> 46:24.380
stick together because we can look after you after you and in turn your extra no that should

46:24.380 --> 46:30.060
get rid of that yeah see this is like live correcting myself like oh that's a terrible

46:30.060 --> 46:36.540
sentence get out of here clingy oh clingy yeah clingy it would work warm breathing is a put

46:36.540 --> 46:44.940
okay so um so when you do your blowing ASMR it's like your your lips are pierced together and like

46:44.940 --> 46:50.460
as if you were gonna whistle okay so it's like oh sorry sorry i didn't mean to whistle sorry um

46:50.460 --> 46:57.580
it's like like that but if you want to warm someone's ears up i have to open my mouth and go

46:58.860 --> 47:04.540
you know um so that's the difference between those two tingles and especially in the three

47:04.540 --> 47:09.100
video is a very big difference you can you can hear the unwanted whistle whistle ASMR when

47:09.740 --> 47:17.340
right fucking now oh my god i'm the wind i'm the i'm the cold wind rushing past your window right

47:17.340 --> 47:25.020
now um okay first we're gonna warm up your ears because i'm going to tell you you're freezing

47:25.020 --> 47:29.420
in here that's why it's better we stick together because we can look in after you so then both

47:30.300 --> 47:37.180
me and emmer emmer oh no don't start that brain please don't me and emmy are gonna do

47:38.620 --> 47:43.580

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:45.020
of funny i don't know how i could do that good compromise yes a family kiss is where you give

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:52.460
each other a family kiss the pentails would do that wait so all three of us are falling asleep

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.140
in the bed yes all three of us are together in bed and we're going to sleep and we're just

01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.900
going to be a little bit of a sleep aid at the end i may add like rain the rain comes on and it's

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:08.140
just gently pitter pattering outside the window i love a good bit of rain and a smart plot but i

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.980
wouldn't do it during i would only be like oh the rain the rain just came on mm i was falling

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:19.260
asleep too but i didn't want to say anything what what exactly do you want me to say i love you too

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.140
you want to say that or just i love you i love you and then

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:34.140
family two whole family kisses like that part two on twitter right you're done you're done

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.220
you're getting rolled in smoke they could be killing him off because he's getting too hot

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:46.380
having both step sisters pressed against him i want to see you know step in this house

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.980
i'll see no step in this house we don't do uh not from around here partner we don't do step

01:02:53.980 --> 01:03:00.220
around here not around these parts you want emmy to say i love you in timo's voice

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:11.100
i love you like this having both blood related sister he's also blood related

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:17.580
wouldn't you make the rain in the background make more sense for cooling down mid audio

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:25.100
i'll see i don't really i don't know when to shove the rain in

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.780
our family tree is a circle

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.700
it's a fucking roundabout at the rate it's heading

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.940
eh they're right what are we doing looping okay they're they're they are and i didn't

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:47.100
they are as implying their facial massagers they are and i didn't score them they just

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:59.660
belong to me now why not focus on how refreshing i don't know why refreshing they are on your face

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:06.860
and the looping around you instead of thinking about the little detail the

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:15.100
little details that don't matter that's probably why you can't sleep dummy

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:22.700
you oh my god please oh my god the english please you just need to tune the world out

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:33.820
and focus on both of us of both your sisters pampering you to sleep okay hold on what the

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:38.860
fuck was this word supposed to be okay i've got there in the end we got there in the end i love

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:45.020
hearing dummy in role plays yeah you're welcome this is probably why you can't sleep dummy

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:52.700

01:04:52.700 --> 01:05:01.020

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:27.020
reminds me of a great german song called mine stab him is in christ i can't read german i'm sorry

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:34.940
if one opens the window mid audio then you can insert your sweaty feet tapping on floor mp3

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:56.300

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:22.540
shoni's chat no you're not banned but like i'm trying to get through one script idea and it's like

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:33.580
let's make it for 10 minutes oh yeah testosterone's peak in the morning it's 3 p.m est is that still

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:40.300
technically morning put us to sleep we're getting killed no to sleep sleep like ASMR sleep oh my god

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:46.460
in some ways the pin pals are keeping hard by like a lot let's do the script step by step is that

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:55.740
fucking is that a step sister joke pretty sure we are trolling unless the pin pals are suffering

01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:01.260
from an MA deficiency no i know exactly what the pin pals and embers have been up to don't think i don't

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:09.580
know that both of you's made an agreement a two weeks i'd be two weeks two whole weeks on both parties

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:16.060
yeah i'm not surprised you guys are in here asking for kissing make out ASMR two weeks that's what you

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:28.460
get two two two sander's triangulate that you get tingles ASMR well well if we're going to make

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:36.940
this group work we have to convince them we actually hang out there's no all right remember this plot

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:42.220
is just an excuse for me to get ac in a drawn in a school uniform okay that's what i'm going

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:52.220
i said it i said it shoni why do you pronounce to sunday like that oh shit too san dairy oh is

01:09:52.220 --> 01:10:03.900
it not how you say to to sunday so yandere to sunday as it's not that it's like sunday oh no

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:17.180
to is is sin oh it's sunday wait no my alliteration it has to be with the tea the tea is silent no my

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:28.380
alliteration the tea is silent why with the tv silent to sunday's triangulate that you get tingles

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:38.860
my alliteration no sorry it's called to sunday's triangulate no wait you said this all your life

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:45.260
yeah i just thought it was tea it's called tea why don't you put a tea in it if the tea doesn't belong

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:54.620
there words are hard oh my god everyone billy to sunday it's not the tea is not silent yeah i thought

01:10:54.620 --> 01:11:03.740
it was to sunday alliteration no i love alliteration like this i mean at least title wise it looks good

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.540
right we're not gonna use this word in the script because i'm probably gonna end up forgetting it's

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:14.860
not said like with the tea god damn well if we're gonna make this group work we have to convince

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:24.300
them we actually hang out there's no uh wait i honestly think we can get away with it but

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:31.260
we're gonna have to learn some i don't know i don't know how to phrase this so the whole point

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:37.660
the whole premise of this plot plot is it's japanese you can't use the same rules as english

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:47.100
me i can't even speak english it doesn't it doesn't count let me be ignorant in my Scottish ways

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:52.620
a fucking poor emi whenever i've written a like something for her for some reason i always

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:57.260
spell stuff horrifically wrong thank god she can correct on the spot when she's reading a script

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:03.740
but i'll always like the biggest case is so she had to say the word kitty that begins with a p

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:12.460
and instead of a u instead of a u i put this so her sentence was like um my juicy

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:22.780
and i completely fucked up and i didn't catch it and thank god she could change it in time um

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:28.780
because some people read over my mistakes because they're like oh that's the way strongy wanted it

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:32.540
and then others are like no this is clearly wrong and we'll change it and i'm like thank god

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:41.740
too sundry on the other hand you can do a new alliteration soon no that no this title looks good

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:49.740
because it's got all the t's in it it's trouble in terrorist town oh it's a soon oh my god i just

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:59.340
leaked a collab idea with it indulge i've never actually played gary's mod but um sheebie has

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:03.900
and i really want to get into it because i think that stuff is hilarious moment what oh no don't

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:12.540
say don't mummy me it makes me nervous the title's good oh my god this is how i say it t sundery

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:20.620
all right to sundry that's exactly what i'm saying what are you talking about tct is the og

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:25.980
among us game is actually feels good i want to do that and i want to do prop hunt i've never done prop

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:33.020
hunt before um but it looks hilarious like i can just imagine me accidentally being a mattress or

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.740
something like being sideways on a wall and i can't figure out how to change and then they're

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.820
just coming in the room and i'm like uh it's not what it looks like and i'm like skedaddle

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:48.620
right well if we're gonna make this right so the whole plot is basically we need to form an after

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:56.700
school grip club so the so then we can be left alone to our own devices but then eventually

01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:03.500
we find out you like asmr and then we do asmr on you whilst kind of bullying you so for those who

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:11.660
like a bit of bullying but not too far it's not like we don't like it's not like we like you or

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:21.100
anything like that kind of shite aye that's this kind of thing to to sundry's trouble you to tingletown

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:29.020
okay oh i always wanted to learn how va's make script oh it's it's an absolute nightmare um ignore

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:35.740
all of this so that this is oh shit i should lay out properly so this is what acy's gonna see

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:45.260
see she's gonna see this and then we're gonna do soft spoken in the middle of the mic please

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:51.500
because we're just gonna talk like normal at the start okay so this is what emmy's gonna see a

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:56.540
big old warning sign that goes i'll be squiddin me right now i swear god this is makeup such

01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:04.060
sensational sense you asunder a sister seek to soften your sulk and soul oh no even brian

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:11.980
doesn't say the tea thank you raven for the tip brian doesn't say the tea say again brian

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:19.500

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:24.380
sulk and soul no how does brian know it but i don't

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:39.340
how does brian know i'll give brian my tip fake weeb oh no i'm definitely the gamer

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.980
over a weeb i think someone asked that in marshmallow i'm so sorry a while ago someone

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:54.860
asked who's um brian studied as japanese honestly um someone asked who the biggest

01:15:54.860 --> 01:16:05.180
weeb is and who's the least weeb the ranking of weeb i think goes azura and then emmy and then

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:12.380
mersey then shebe then me however the gap between shebe and me is astronomical i have such little

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:18.300
anime under my belt i mean if you guys want to watch anime together i wouldn't mind um if if it's

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:23.980
a short like 12 episode only kind of anime we could probably just spoon it out in one day um

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.300
i wouldn't i wouldn't mind that i'd be down for that the gap between me and shebe from weeb to

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:37.180
gamer by is like massive like i am just by far a gamer i've consumed an astronomical amount of

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:44.220
benti um i used to be a puddin addict so that's kind of where my exposure really comes from um

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:52.780
i know that's gross but it's just the truth so it is what it is that's really my exposure

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:59.260
to the japanese weeb culture um i i mean i was like into i mean i'm still in a hatsunumiki like

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:07.660

and all that jazz and like the motherly aspect um he means the lollipop yeah i figured it out

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:09.500
i got there in the end okay right we've written one sentence of this ace more collab that's

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:13.180
probably not i'm gonna well if we're gonna make this group work we have to convince

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:25.100
the teachers the teachers we actually hang out i hope i honestly think we can get away with it

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:33.980
but we're gonna have to learn a little bit about each other so we don't seem awkward or non

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:44.940
interactive with one another when we're in class or walking down the halls through i don't know

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:51.020
american schools always portray the hallways as like never fucking ending and like a lot of stuff

01:20:51.020 --> 01:21:02.940
occurs a lot of stuff non interactive non net on a non interactive i don't know i'm sure there's

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.700
better word i'll fix it later as i said when we write the stuff live i'll fix it later when i come

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:12.060
back to it which line is the start that ac lets you go through the phone

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:19.740
ac hasn't gone through the phone yet ac is gonna yank the phone you know her posable claws are

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:25.900
quite good for yonking shit it yeah classes can be really far apart literally all the time

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:31.020
like american shows like uh it takes 20 minutes to get to the next class and it's like what how

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:40.700
was that efficient for anyone at first they yank the main hall in my high school was 400 meters

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:46.700
long the fuck you mean non interactive non interactive oh wait isn't that going e that's

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:53.340
what i said non oh do you drop the e oh because an e before i unless something something i've

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:58.540
already forgotten the rule but anyway that's english for you it's cost efficient for companies to

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.180
build a school like that

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:09.100
yeah i have classes that were like five minutes between it really wasn't enough time

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:13.660
oh i bet you the teachers were like where were you then and it was like walking from one classroom

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:18.140
to another and they probably never expected it i like learned about hall passes as well we must

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:24.140
learn a little bit about each other show me what color you're and i need to go on to the next

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:31.420
freaking script we haven't even we we haven't even add on add on i'm begging you just bust one out

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:37.900
okay clear your mind clear your mind because this is clearly there's something going on that i'm missing

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.740
well how how did you do that even i even i am not in a position to do that at this moment in time

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:49.420
i had classes that were three hours apart rip that

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:55.100
why do you think he's asking you the claw already lost to the script

01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:01.180
oh stop that's funny that's funny i seen stroney look at each other the best way to get

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:08.780
know each other 92 minutes of kiss and say right i'm gonna progress to the script because you guys

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:13.580
are made distract me well if we're gonna make if we're going to make this group work we have to

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:17.580
convince the teachers we actually hang out i hope we can get away with it but we're gonna have to

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:22.220
learn a little bit about each other so we don't seem awkward or non-interactive with one each other

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:27.500
with one another when we're in class or walking down the hall i will make that english at a later

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:36.860
date because i don't think that's english the question is what do we even do right now i mean

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:50.780
at least we managed to reserve this classroom maybe something as simple as 21 questions

01:23:50.780 --> 01:24:04.620
question mark i hope that's not european quit with us i guess that's a good start um what would ac ask

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:18.780

with good taste but looks like looks like like you are a bit more of a deviant than

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.500
i first thought

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:11.900

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:40.700
certainly can wait so when you're on your phone all day long you have this playing in your earphones

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:54.940
strange strange i i wouldn't i would never have assumed you seem so you seem so

01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:08.140
normal well maybe liking asmr doesn't mean you're not normal but i don't really

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:18.380
i well maybe liking asmr doesn't mean you're not normal but i personally wouldn't go around

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:31.180
making it obvious i get tingles i don't i don't know i think bullies might pick on you if they

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:35.340
were to find out remember we are high school students so obviously we care about what the

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:40.860
bullies think oh the bullies someone please think of the bullies oh the bullies any bullies

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:49.020
where the bullies around these parts again these are drafts i am most likely gonna fix the absolute

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:53.340
crap out of them offline i can't i can't think of this stuff off the top of my head for too long

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:59.100
i'm boozy yeah you're the bully or you want to get bullied because i can make the girls say whatever

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:06.540
you want you don't really watch asmr so instead put you like listening to asmr

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:09.980
hmm wait so you're on your phone all day long you have this playing in your exchange

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.740
i would never have assumed you seem so normal well maybe liking asmr doesn't mean you're not

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:18.460
normal but i personally wouldn't go around making it obvious i get tingles i don't know i think bully

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.900
uh wait so am i is this

01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:33.740
i think bullies might pick on you there so i guess you uh no more guessing what did you say

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:44.060
is that why you shivered randomly in class yesterday i picked up on it but i didn't want

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:56.540
to say anything because i thought i gave you a jump scare when i texted you this after school plan

01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:09.900
in all honesty in all honesty um have you ever tried giving the 3d or what really i have um

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:16.140
i'm actually gonna upload all those videos on twitter when i get a second to breathe unfortunately

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:23.100
things still haven't quite settled down behind the scenes um we might need to hire a thumbnail maker

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:32.780
but i don't know i don't know how much like thumbnail makers cost or like not it's not like

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:38.540
draw a whole new thumbnail it's like no take these pngs of all the girls take the game they're playing

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:44.780
and then give us a thumbnail okay like i i think we might need to post that we need that at the

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:55.100
moment um and then it frees up a lot of um jobs behind the scenes no no make one of your thumbnails

01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:01.740
mass producing thumbnails that's super easy to learn i don't even know if there's like a

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:07.980
going rate for it or like is it like you pair you pay per thumbnail i don't know that's a lot

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:19.420
if this character a zoomer why use jump scare oh wait what the term jump scare

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:29.740
i'm sorry i'm not following jump scare is a generational term am i being dumb pay them

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:36.860
and in me strongy makers that's terrible that would be hilarious agency exposed for paying

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:45.900
contractors via audios audios of a unique variation i picked up on it i didn't want to say

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:53.820
because i thought you gotta jump here and then this is where a a phone tapping ASMR

01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:02.940
wait so if i do this it might make you shiver all right i'll have it we do it like that you

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:08.060
keep shivering and then we're as like spurs us on to do it more to you and like have a giggle with you

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:15.820
i think that'll do it if so we discover you shiver with ASMR because some people have like a

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:23.260
visceral reaction if you will and their body goes like and then it spurs us on to actually try hard

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:28.460
as well because it's so entertaining but then eventually we're like um okay this is getting

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:34.460
weird now we need to go home smile how about she reacts to the listener being nervous as he's gonna

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:39.980
unlock the phone with her taps no so we've just taken the phone off the listener and discovered

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:46.140
that they like ASMR so we're kind of discussing it a little bit without being too details with it

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:54.220
so if i do this it might make you shiver wait that's so cute is acl out to call you cute even

01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:02.540

college was so strict whenever it scripts i'm in communication oh this is like please do not think

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:09.340
this is how actual people write scripts this is how my brain processes and slams stuff down

01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:16.620
it is a it is a complete nightmare the only way my brain can like slam this down like when i send

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:22.300
this to emmy for example what i do is i highlight like her words as well so she knows what she needs

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:29.580
to see um etc like this is not professional in any way shape or form i'm just showing you how i do it

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:37.180
and you have to take everything i do with a pinch of salt because ac sph big paw humiliation

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:45.580
honestly that's so cute i want to write that um wait so if i do this it makes you shiver

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:50.940
wait that's so cute do it again and then so this is where ac is kind of figuring out wait

01:39:51.660 --> 01:40:04.380
wait wait you huh so it can't be done over and over again do i have to switch it up like how

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:18.620
they do in the videos no i'm not going to bully you over this i am genuinely curious i don't

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:31.980
i don't think hearing sounds would ever make my body jerk whoa make my body shiver the way

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:38.940
you just did there how about that you remember that weird ass song

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:47.820
you're a jerk you're a jerk jerk jerk are you squid me right now brian then suddenly out of nowhere

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:53.740
they started making all right yous are actually fucking done and on thank you for the tip for

01:40:53.740 --> 01:41:04.460
folk sick for folk sick no um this is totally how people write scripts it's just they go through

01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:10.140
infinite revisions with co-writers and editors yes what you're seeing is basically what a draft

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:16.220
looks like but i will be honest there's some stuff doesn't really get changed that much but like for

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:21.660
example the emi collab i need to extend it dramatically but i also don't want to give

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:28.860
emi too many words to say because then it becomes like a nightmare to record you never like i i would

01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:35.100
highly recommend never giving more than a thousand words that is becoming a very intense collab

01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:40.940
now with the nature of emi at ic's collab with me because we're doing soft spoken we're actually

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:47.900
about to do whispering next which is even worse on the voice so give me all the words it's okay

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:54.540
oh shit emi's here for the challenge um but in general for a collab partner you do not want to

01:41:54.540 --> 01:42:01.020
overwhelm them like there's nothing worse than you know being like oh i'm so excited to do a collab

01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:04.780
and then you turn around and give like over a thousand words and it's like what the fuck this

01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:12.060
is gonna take me like so long to record and so long to edit to give you the correct lines um

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:19.020
yeah i usually write out the first like an outline first with the key phrases i want and then end up

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:26.140
yeah that's the way i do it i'm just intro middle ending shiplash yeah she's also really young so

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:31.900
many words are dangerous for her oh what did he say i've already written over one key words for

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:39.020
my collabs oh no well i mean my i always try and do them tiny but like as i said if you want

01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:42.700
us to do like a collab with me and you and me obviously you can just give me whatever you need

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:51.580
because yeah that's not a problem but uh in general um i would say try and no i just i mean

01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:56.300
then again emi's fucking collab like absolutely cooked i think it's approaching like 30 case

01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:03.100
viewers which is insane um which is absolutely doing fantastic so maybe i should shut my trap

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:09.180
and take a note out of emi's book huh huh you ever thought about that strawny huh huh do you have you

01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:14.540
okay sometimes you think of a banger lane and then you write a script at the same time it's

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:20.540
fun to have parts in the skill play emi going hard it's fine you can take breaks from speaking

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:27.260
when yours are to make it okay you're all done you're all fucking done fighting the demons again

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:35.740
um i have a really i have given really long one sister only sister i'm sorry what

01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:39.180
oh what did he say

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:50.140
shocking behavior honestly i love my hard-working daughter emi the hat that hat is in the merch shop

01:43:54.780 --> 01:44:00.060
the merch is we've got standees we've got keychains and we've got hoodies and trusers if you want

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:07.820
trusers don't don't be afraid to support the merch because it means we get more merch later smile

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:18.060
if the merch is supported now smile is there a preferred length to asmr um now so i've got a

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:24.380
collab coming out with uh right you know what dempo the dempo collabs already out me and dempo

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:30.620
only actually had about five minutes of speaking but the audio is 15 minutes extended because of

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:38.700
the plot i wrote whole merch whole merch it's coming okay i need to i need everyone's stats

01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:47.500
to be up just a teeny tiny bit and then i'll contact uh the uh location i love dempo i rigged

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:55.020
shut the fuck up she told me she drew it and got it rigged you rigged her model

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:06.940
that's insane i did not know that lore no way i freaking yanked her tentacles she gave me her

01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:12.140
tentacles for a collab it's really hard to see in the video but i have tentacles on my back

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:18.140
yeah me and dempo are a model birth and dream team oh my god that's so precious

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:25.980
he did fantastic yeah i like i went to dempo i was like is it okay if i can borrow your um

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.540
i can i borrow your tentacles for this um collab and she was like yeah here take

01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:37.180
off and i was like she needs a looking good i'm very proud of those tentacles yes

01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:42.940
wow oh my god it's like a family reunion in here god damn

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:49.260
yeah i know the collab with dempo was a hooten holler honestly um

01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:55.580
etchy and dempo bret well when you put it like that she

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:03.820
right so we've done phone tap and let me highlight it just so we know i mean i think ac makes sense

01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:09.820
to do like nail kind of related stuff like because you know she got big massive clothes

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:18.300
mommy needs tentacles uh wait until i get an alternative outfit okay i i think uh i'm definitely

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:25.500
gonna have tentacles coming from somewhere and it's not my tailbone but it's somewhere behind me

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.180
mm-hmm

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:35.660
oh maybe i should make the tentacles green like your legs riefling and imply that i have sat on

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:41.660
you oh okay we're developing that i said what said eldritch priestess nah

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:49.340
um nope nope around the back not the belly button i should have

01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:55.580
um ultra killer reference when i don't know what ultra killers i'm so sorry forgive me

01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:01.580
reeflings become your plug yeah i think i want to do something like that model wise

01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:08.700
even if it's just a toggle because i wouldn't have the tentacles out all the time but i think

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:15.100
it would be very nice to have like your tentacles like wrapped around my legs and stuff and that

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:20.780
i think that would be really cool that's just my opinion anyway reeflings stuck in her ass

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:28.220
how did she sell it no no because i was gonna get that commissioned that would be so sick honestly

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:32.940
for example there are more or less around 200 tentacles right now

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:38.060
can never escape the spelunking allegations honestly right we should make a bit more progress

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:44.540
do i have to switch it up like uh how do they do in the videos oh actually i have terrible news for

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:51.340
any reefling that is currently waiting for the membership asmr stream i'm gonna have to cancel

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:57.820
it because i'm not very well today um i do apologize if anyone's holding off i swear

01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:02.060

01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:58.860
even being funny we've not even finished like 50 of a script it's just it's just not undone

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:04.780
all the way down but to give you an idea of how you write a collab script like the mersey

01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:10.060
two yandere's take care of their human pet i'm gonna turn it into a sleep aid because i think

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:19.580
it'd be cute if we're like snoozing together i'm gonna be like chainsounds.sfx fucking rope sfx

01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:25.660
i don't know shuffling soft breathing like all that jazz that's a long ass script no no no it's

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:33.340
five collabs it's five collabs it goes emmy and then it goes icers uh icie here and then it goes

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:38.220
mersey which is two yandere's tied you up because you guys want scottish yandere

01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:48.300
i you like that i bet you do uh azure uh goddesses i get upgraded to goddess status um i'll work on

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:54.620
it i might come back and do something different sheepsters two office ladies uh and you do overtime

01:49:54.620 --> 01:50:00.300
i think that's a really good title um and then basically oh my god you look so tired

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:06.300
you have confessed you have not slept at all oh no we must pamper you at once asimar continues

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:12.780
listener falls asleep all is good in the world amen yeah

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:19.260
they give her all the love and she's just down atrocious shake in my head my head

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:27.180
yes yandere's johnny is good i thought i was the only love of your life what do you mean is

01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:35.260
any like my accent what do you mean and you don't find it intimidating are you no scared of me are

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:42.140
you no fear of what i'm going to do to you if i catch you with another girl that's what i thought

01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:48.140
so sit down senpai and take it like a good boy yeah that's what you want

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:55.980
a scottish yandere who would want that definitely release date when question mark i don't know when

01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:01.980
the girls will be available it sounds like emi's absolutely tag teamed up the wazoo doing asimar

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:07.260
scripts asmar collapse so i'm gonna let her cook for a bit there's no major rush on these as i said

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:12.300
like i think there was just straight up hoping to move out so is mercy um before any of this stuff

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:17.340
this is this is just kind of goofing off and showing you what it's like congrats on 9k oh

01:51:53.020 --> 01:52:01.340
second of it oh yeah but yes that's the behind the scenes unfortunately my brain isn't working

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:08.700
which is why this has taken me two hours to write not even a full script lol and i get

01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:14.220
super distracted and you guys wouldn't stop freaking tipping saying and now they make out like

01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:21.420

01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:05.180
pick it up again can we get a veal or stank tier list so everyone thought mersey was the stinkiest

01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:11.100
because she like made reference to something and me was like sitting behind the scenes like

01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:15.180
i haven't showered or washed in all these days and i don't even wear deodorant behind the

01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:20.060
sea like because if i don't go outside what's the point of wearing deodorant uh and i'm like the

01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:27.420
pu allure agatius imagine scented candles that's i've actually seen that there's like this brand

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:26.940
if i'm gonna nap so the only problem with that eight hour sleep fix is i am not awake in the

01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:37.980
middle of the night to to record ASMR because it gets really loud uh because of traffic and stuff

01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:43.420

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:21.420
board to cease the allegations that'll come after now's the time to make the conflation

02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:27.980
a roleplay because you look the part what what does that mean that bars up my tent will call for

02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:32.940

02:00:54.860 --> 02:01:00.060
what about how i wash my butt after i poop i never feel clean i don't know if you guys have

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:07.020
a big butt but i have to stand up to wipe sometimes thank you for the tip for all the legend i don't

02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:11.740
know i don't know if you guys stand up and wait but my butt cheeks are quite big so i have to stand

02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:19.260
up and wipe sometimes i can't sit down and do it it doesn't work because my cheeks are so big

02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:27.260
so i have to go for a shower as well well i stand yeah that's why i'm like i want a japanese toilet

02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:36.060
the lord thickens honestly i always squat it doesn't make me clean no i just get a shower like

02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:41.020
i'll wipe and then i'll just go for a shower strone i can't the giant fucking dumpy strikes again

02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:48.940
the big dumper problems can't relate i stand my stand wiper oh shit i think this is getting to

02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:54.380

02:01:54.380 --> 02:02:00.620
gums on a wall yeah i remember i was like oh i was like even for me that's a bit so your cheeks

02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:09.660

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.540
let's wrap it up we'll redirect into sheebie who is definitely not talking or articulating about

02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:20.620
any of these types of conversations um she uh tell me you brush your teeth no i actually have no

02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:26.700
problems with brushing my teeth i genuinely have no problems flossing etc um so i'm quite happy

02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:33.180
to report in on that it's just the pheromone maxim no wonder you can give a round of applause

02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:40.220
with them chief thank you be a little lover that's hilarious i can i'm actually gonna try

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:45.340

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:26.540
like this but i could probably show you a finished collab script like i'm sure dempa uh would be

02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:33.740
comfortable with me showing what i sent her to record um all that thingies um that's why they

02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:40.860
did it oh yeah um the noise of me clapping without my hands wasn't offensive or against the rules it

02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:46.380
was me breathing in the ear when i did it when i leaned in it said like around the 10 minute 58

02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:52.620
seconds or something i breathed into the microphone and did it and that's what got me taken down so

02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:59.660
