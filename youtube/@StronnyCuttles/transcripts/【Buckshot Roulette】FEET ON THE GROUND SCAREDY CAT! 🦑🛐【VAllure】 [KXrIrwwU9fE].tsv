0	5000	No time to wait for my days, we're getting longer in this
5000	10000	No time to wait for my days, of all the time
10000	16000	Right, this is British lore
16000	18000	Oh wait, hold on
18000	22000	Dule Lover, thank you for becoming a member
22000	25000	I have no idea what it's like even it says I'm online yet
26000	29000	No it doesn't, oh this is the thing
29000	33000	Whenever I look back on a board, I'm like rambling to myself for a full minute
33000	37000	Because for some reason it doesn't bring itself up for a full minute
37000	39000	Even though I'm sitting here, meh meh
39000	43000	But when I look back on the board, and all that, it's all fine
43000	45000	All fine
45000	47000	The fine line
47000	50000	Right, where are we? Nope
50000	52000	Nope, not yet
52000	54000	Not playing the game yet
54000	57000	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon
57000	61000	I am your host, Ronnie Cuttles
61000	63000	Coming at you with a fried voice
63000	67000	Thank you, Dule Lover for becoming a member in case that did not register
67000	68000	She loves it, she loves it
68000	71000	On time question mark, yes I haven't been lurking in the shadows
71000	77000	I had to do some bit of background work
77000	80000	What's the background work you ask?
81000	84000	I put Shabby Cotton Bum's memberships live
84000	87000	So if you want to be a cheeky harem and get in
87000	89000	But she might not say your name during the stream though
89000	93000	You're probably better waiting on the stream in two hours time
93000	96000	Shabby Cotton Bum, maybe I should be a bit bigger
96000	98000	Cause I'm kinda talking
103000	106000	Well I'll just stand right here, like right over the text and everything
106000	110000	Why not? Why not? Why do I have to be professional?
110000	111000	It's shocking
111000	114000	Hold on, I'll actually go weave because BOOM!
114000	118000	Good morning, good evening, good afternoon little reeflings
118000	125000	What is on the agendination for week three?
125000	129000	Okay, let me talk you through it, okay?
129000	134000	So we're starting off strong with the ASMR stream
135000	138000	At the usual time
138000	143000	And then after two hours I will go offline and have a 15 minute pause
143000	150000	Because we're going to be doing our first membership watch along
150000	154000	Which is none other than the first Transformers movie
154000	157000	With Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee
157000	161000	Sweet little Bumblebee, I know what he wants from me
161000	166000	To kill the Decepticon and stop them from ruining the planet
166000	172000	And then the following day, on a Tuesday for the rest of the world
172000	176000	We are playing Zelda Minish Cap
176000	181000	Now statistically this game takes roughly eight hours to finish
181000	184000	Whether or not it takes me eight hours, I don't know
184000	188000	But we will be taking a pause 15 minutes before
189000	194000	Because for member stream, we are going to be doing the forbidden tear list
194000	199000	Ooooooh, not the way you want the big yin
199000	203000	And I get to answer it honestly this time
203000	207000	Because I'm allowed to say what I want to say
207000	212000	If we do not finish it in the first day, which is unlikely due to the member stream
212000	215000	Then the rest of the day on Wednesday
215000	218000	Is dedicated to Zelda Minish Cap
218000	224000	It is the only Zelda game I have ever completed or played
224000	227000	I know it's shocking, hold on, wait
227000	229000	Whoa, it won't let me stretch out chat
229000	231000	Chat, you'd let me stretch
231000	234000	Why the frick frack diddley-dack?
234000	237000	Does it not let me stretch chat?
237000	240000	Wait, is it because I normally have you on the screen?
241000	243000	Oh my god, let me stretch you
243000	245000	Why is it locked?
245000	249000	Chat is locked for me, so I can't even read just properly
249000	251000	Brev, brev
251000	253000	I'm trying to explain
253000	255000	What am I doing? Anyway
255000	257000	Oh my god
257000	259000	Eh, you be next
259000	261000	Thank you for coming on member
261000	264000	Oh my god, is that the mascot for um
264000	266000	WeleuVeton Inc
266000	268000	I'm so sorry
268000	270000	Chat, her name evades me right now
270000	272000	From hololiveleuVeton Inc
272000	276000	Oh my god, why is her name not in my mouth?
276000	283000	Purple, with the most adorable little sea ears
283000	286000	Oh my goodness
286000	288000	Anyway
288000	292000	Um, we are going to do old school runescape on Thursday
292000	294000	Oh, and now my chat's broken completely
294000	296000	Oh, thanks OBS
296000	297000	No, really, thank you
297000	299000	Please don't ever cook again
299000	301000	Oh, it finally worked
301000	302000	Inna, yes Inna
302000	304000	Oh my goodness, I don't know why chat wasn't working
304000	306000	Chat, yeah
306000	308000	Well, it's fixed, I can actually read chat now
308000	309000	Inna, yes Inna
309000	311000	In my hole, thank you
311000	313000	Um, let's see
313000	316000	So then we're going to do old school runescape
316000	318000	However, check it
318000	322000	I'm doing my first ever one-on-one collab with WeleuVeton Inc
322000	324000	And guess what?
324000	327000	It's with Mercy
327000	331000	I should have picked any kind of yandere
331000	332000	But I got Mercy
332000	333000	And we're going to be playing Goose Game
333000	335000	We're going to be playing it at her time
335000	337000	So we're only going to do a little bit of runescape
337000	341000	But if I can get a couple of levels in, I will take it
341000	345000	Um, so a couple hours of runescape and blabbing away
345000	348000	And then I will go offline for a few hours to recharge
348000	350000	Because I want to give Mercy my all
350000	353000	She's not ready for the rotism, your honor
353000	355000	Memberships are showing up to me on mobile
355000	358000	Thank you, Omar and Simpson
358000	360000	It still doesn't display properly
360000	362000	Even though I have the full chat up
362000	365000	Memberships are showing up for me on YouTube mobile
365000	367000	For a sheebie cotton bum, they better be
367000	369000	Because we are redirecting into her
369000	372000	If you didn't know, sheebie has posted pictures of herself
372000	375000	In a self-made cosplay of sheebie
375000	377000	Yep, that's a full sentence
377000	380000	Let me check them out by discovering the alternative twiers
380000	382000	If you don't know what the alternative twiers are
382000	386000	Feel free to check out who the accounts are following
386000	389000	But yes, at Mercy's usual stream time
389000	392000	I wanted to make the collab super easy for her
392000	396000	So I am going to have to rest and snort
396000	398000	Some...
398000	400000	Shouldn't have said that
400000	402000	I'm going to be taking lots of cola
402000	405000	Okay, I'm going to be slurping my cola for any caffeination
405000	407000	Because I'm probably going to be a wee bit
407000	409000	I'm going to start lagging a little bit there
409000	410000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
410000	412000	Ain't I meant for you either
412000	414000	You don't have to give me money to tell me this
414000	416000	You just realise that, Omar
416000	420000	You don't have to give me money to type things in chat
424000	425000	Scotland forever
425000	427000	Yes, erm...
427000	430000	Well, I was originally going to do a heart rate monitor this stream
430000	432000	Count up for the life of me, find it
432000	434000	I bought a new heart rate monitor
434000	436000	Because my other one was bust
436000	438000	Erm, and it's already gone
438000	440000	So I think I'm about to purchase the third one
440000	441000	Lucky me
441000	442000	Erm, I'll probably...
442000	444000	If I send a cure package to the girls
444000	446000	Like, for Donothons, me just looking in my...
446000	448000	Others have cute mascots
448000	450000	We have a cute Scottish girl
450000	452000	What?
455000	456000	Wait
456000	458000	Did Brian talk?
461000	462000	Did Brian say...
462000	464000	No, did Brian say anything there?
465000	467000	Oh shit, I didn't see that
467000	469000	Aren't...
469000	471000	Others have cute mascots
471000	473000	We have a cute Scottish...
473000	474000	Girl
474000	476000	Thank you for the five iron reaper
476000	477000	I appreciate it
477000	478000	Oh, I never heard that
478000	480000	Sorry, I have my headset muted
480000	482000	Because I have the freaking game sound in the background
482000	483000	It's so loud
483000	484000	Are you squiddin' me right now?
484000	487000	Can't wait to see Strone as the imposter in this game
487000	489000	Wait, what?
489000	491000	No, wait
491000	493000	We're playing Nero
493000	495000	We're playing a game called Untitled Kiss Game
495000	497000	Erm
497000	499000	If you didn't see
499000	502000	AC actually revealed that she's playing with Emmy
502000	504000	On a game called Don't Starve
504000	506000	And I'm like, jeez, that's a bit brutal
506000	508000	That's exactly AC's lore
508000	511000	Because she had to hunt for her food
511000	513000	So, rather curious
513000	515000	Rather curious, aren't they?
519000	520000	Erm
522000	524000	What else? Elden...
524000	526000	Yes, Elden Ring the DLC
526000	529000	Elden Ring the DLC, okay?
529000	531000	It launches on Friday
531000	533000	I'm like 99% sure
534000	536000	Erm
536000	540000	Even if it doesn't come out by the time we start playing
540000	543000	We have a lot of areas to clear anyway
543000	546000	And I am under the impression
546000	549000	We have to perish the enemy
549000	552000	That's at the top of this elevator
552000	554000	In that graveyard
554000	558000	Unironically, Ryan Goslin was the one
558000	560000	That vanquished him
560000	562000	Because I couldn't do it, I kept getting attacked
562000	565000	So the refland's on a freaking debuff
565000	567000	Like a severe debuff
567000	569000	Whilst I was running away from this boss
569000	571000	All came flying in
571000	574000	And I'm like 99% sure that was a Ryan Goslin kill that one
574000	576000	Erm
576000	578000	I do say shortcaller
578000	580000	Now, I do have a shortcaller
580000	582000	We're gonna test it out at the start of stream
582000	584000	If I can handle it
584000	586000	I will permit my reflings to zap me
586000	589000	Every time I cause us to die
589000	592000	Erm, I will try and keep the heart rate monitor too
592000	595000	Just so you can see how freaking messed up I get
595000	597000	Whenever we get near an enemy
597000	599000	Now
599000	602000	I need you to open your eyeballs for me, okay?
602000	607000	Because members' ASMR stream starts one hour earlier
607000	609000	Than my usual start time
609000	611000	The reason for that is
611000	616000	Imi, Azura, Mercy, Strawny
616000	618000	Are doing a four man uno collab
618000	621000	So that I can't get away from Mercy this week
621000	623000	I'm already entangled in her snare, you know
623000	626000	Erm, and then
626000	629000	So that's two streams that day
629000	630000	Yeah
630000	632000	Erm
632000	634000	And then and then and then
634000	636000	Sorry, I did apologize for your head
636000	638000	I didn't get a good sleep last night
638000	639000	Again
639000	640000	Erm
640000	642000	I'm getting very tired
642000	644000	Actually, I'll tell you something really bad
644000	647000	So I had to take sleep medicine the other day
647000	649000	But whenever I take sleep medicine
649000	652000	I have problems going number two, okay?
652000	656000	And then I hurt my butt going number two
657000	662000	So if there's anyone that wants to help kiss it better
664000	667000	And then Elden Ring part two
667000	671000	We again will have a full endurance on that
671000	676000	I am literally weaving so much content in between this as well
676000	679000	Because I'm also starting up my thank you series
679000	684000	My one ASMR video pair 1000 views thank you series
684000	687000	I am absolutely delighted
687000	690000	And exhausted to learn that I
690000	695000	My scheduled uploaded ASMR for 1000 subs
695000	697000	I've already reached 7000
697000	700000	Which means the debt of six is still to be paid
700000	701000	Erm
701000	703000	I'm very thankful
703000	705000	But oh man I'm tired
705000	706000	Erm
706000	708000	After this stream today
708000	711000	I'm actually going to record three
711000	714000	Collab ASMR's from my side
714000	717000	Because three girls have given me their side
717000	719000	Erm
719000	723000	So I need to edit that
723000	726000	Unending ASMR's
726000	728000	Back to back to back
728000	730000	Erm
730000	732000	There's so many replays now
732000	733000	I know I'm busy
733000	735000	My mum is very busy
735000	736000	Erm
736000	737000	If you didn't know
737000	740000	AC's meme ASMR has gone live
740000	742000	It is sniffing ASMR
742000	743000	If you like that trigger
743000	746000	Mercy's ASMR has like
746000	749000	I got a fucking cat here in my mouth all the time
749000	750000	Erm
750000	753000	Yeah you really do get used to it when you get cats honestly
753000	754000	Erm
754000	756000	You're just like oh that's just another part of the video
756000	757000	Erm
757000	761000	Mercy has released Yandere ASMR
761000	762000	Erm
762000	765000	Please if you absolutely despise the meme ASMR's
765000	767000	I got them to create
767000	769000	Well guess who fucking created them for them
769000	770000	Me
770000	771000	So if you hate them
771000	772000	Don't be like
772000	773000	Mmm
773000	774000	This video is stinky
774000	775000	Be like
775000	776000	Mmm
776000	777000	Strongly stinky
777000	778000	Because she came up with a concept
778000	779000	Okay
779000	780000	So don't
780000	781000	If you didn't like it don't worry
781000	782000	It's not like it's the only ASMR video
782000	784000	They're ever going to produce for free on YouTube
784000	786000	Like fucking relax
786000	787000	For one
787000	788000	Erm
788000	790000	Haha
790000	791000	I'm sorry
791000	793000	I'm literally fighting imaginary people
793000	795000	One person has said that at all
795000	797000	I know for a fact no one has said that
797000	799000	And I'm like already swinging on behalf of the girls
799000	802000	Like don't say nothing about my girls okay
802000	803000	Erm
803000	804000	But yes
804000	807000	Mercy's ASMR actually I was influenced by
807000	808000	Well
808000	809000	So
809000	811000	I had already created this over a year ago
811000	815000	And I think this was before the creator of Yandere Sim
815000	818000	Got outed for all of his
818000	819000	Erm
819000	820000	I'm 32
820000	822000	You have so much power over me tweets
822000	824000	Or whatever the tweet was
824000	827000	I can't remember the ins and outs of it
827000	829000	Erm
829000	830000	But
830000	831000	I
831000	832000	If you didn't know
832000	833000	In Yandere Sim
833000	834000	There's a mechanic
834000	837000	Where in order to lower your craziness levels
837000	838000	You need to laugh
838000	842000	You need to laugh very loud and very startling
842000	844000	And if anyone is around you while you laugh
844000	845000	It alerts them
845000	846000	And I was like
846000	848000	How did I do that for Mercy
848000	849000	So
849000	850000	I did an intro
850000	851000	Setting up the plot
851000	854000	She comes and finds you type thing
854000	856000	And then she laughs like a maniac
856000	857000	Ear to ear in the mic
857000	859000	And I absolutely love it
859000	860000	I absolutely love it
860000	862000	But I think that's cause I knew about
862000	864000	I've never actually played Yandere Sim but
864000	865000	Yeah
865000	867000	Preemptive defense is a good strategy
867000	869000	Literally just smashing people's skulls in
869000	871000	No one has said a thing to me
871000	873000	But the rage has already taken over
873000	874000	Erm
874000	877000	The only discord group with speedrun pan records
877000	878000	Honestly
878000	879000	Also
879000	880000	And
880000	882000	Oh did Emi release it?
884000	885000	So
885000	888000	I went the complete meme route for Emi
888000	891000	But Emi isn't quite with me
891000	892000	On the same page
892000	893000	Which is fine
893000	894000	It's completely fine
894000	895000	She has complete control
895000	896000	So I was like
896000	897000	Upload it if you want it
897000	898000	Don't
898000	899000	Oh wait she did upload it
902000	903000	Okay
903000	904000	Okay
904000	906000	So she kept the thumbnail the same
906000	907000	Okay
907000	908000	I wasn't gonna like it
908000	909000	Okay okay okay
911000	913000	So she's called the video
913000	914000	Alleyway Tingle Dealer
914000	917000	Sells you completely legal tingles ASMR
917000	918000	That's good title
918000	919000	I like that title
919000	921000	My title was
921000	923000	VTuber Sells you
925000	927000	Tingles in an alleyway
927000	929000	I think or something like that
929000	931000	We did have to
931000	933000	The artist at the time drew AC
933000	934000	Emi
934000	935000	Sorry they're twins
935000	937000	Drew Emi
937000	938000	Not Pattan
938000	940000	So we had to put a little
940000	941000	Sutton Sutton over
941000	943000	I loved the 30 minute Japanese one
943000	944000	I'm glad you enjoyed it
944000	945000	That is basically
945000	947000	What unscripted
947000	948000	ASMR
948000	949000	Turns it into
949000	951000	If I don't have a script
951000	952000	I will yap my head off
952000	954000	So Emi also has her meme ASMR
954000	955000	Now that she's monetised
955000	957000	Which is fan-tiddly-astic
961000	963000	The next
963000	966000	Meme ASMR is Shibi
966000	968000	Which I'm actually gonna ask her permission
968000	970000	To do it once
970000	972000	Once your monetisation stream
972000	974000	I know professional streamer by the way
974000	976000	Once your monetisation stream
976000	977000	Has finished
977000	979000	My dear Shibi
979000	982000	Would you like me to upload and
982000	983000	Pub
983000	984000	Is it publish?
984000	985000	No
985000	986000	Like upload and
987000	989000	Put live your
989000	991000	Meme ASMR
991000	993000	You guys are gonna freaking love the plot
993000	994000	I came up with Shibi
994000	996000	Shibi's plot was so unique
996000	999000	I had to go away and record folly sounds
999000	1000000	Which is rare for me
1000000	1002000	Because I have a massive bank
1002000	1004000	Of sounds that I can
1004000	1005000	Come from
1008000	1009000	It was great
1009000	1011000	You were loving the ear mass
1011000	1014000	Oh you like the 7 girl collab

1038000	1040000	Anonymous

1065000	1067000	You've already guessed what channel it's going on
1069000	1071000	There's no way in heck you don't know who it is
1071000	1073000	And then after that
1073000	1074000	For next week
1074000	1076000	There's another 7 man collab
1076000	1078000	I need to put together
1080000	1081000	The work never ends
1081000	1083000	But the work is good
1083000	1084000	It's like that good kind of stress
1084000	1086000	Wait I'm gonna need confirmation
1086000	1088000	Right think of one VA
1088000	1090000	That I talk to all the time

1104000	1106000	But
1106000	1108000	Because I have the artwork so I can edit it
1108000	1110000	But then the fourth
1110000	1112000	7 man collab
1112000	1114000	I'm waiting on this animator
1114000	1116000	To animate the artwork
1116000	1118000	And the worst part is
1118000	1120000	Well actually
1120000	1121000	It's not the worst part
1121000	1123000	The animator that I usually use
1123000	1124000	Are like

1932000	1934000	Now I know undercutting
1934000	1935000	Normally implies

1956000	1957000	To be stepped on
1957000	1958000	And she was like

2019000	2020000	Again with the five gifted
2020000	2022000	Congrats to those who caught it with your
2022000	2023000	Face
2023000	2024000	In your face
2025000	2027000	Oh my god we need to play Kung Fu Kiosk again
2027000	2028000	But I'm so bad at it
2029000	2030000	Tornado
2034000	2036000	Your doodles are so cute
2037000	2038000	Oh no
2038000	2040000	I don't know how to draw
2040000	2041000	Actually I could show
2041000	2043000	Oh I should have shown it on the
2043000	2045000	Handcam stream
2045000	2047000	I tried to learn to draw
2047000	2049000	And I was consistent for like
2049000	2051000	Five days before work
2051000	2052000	Just got far too much
2052000	2054000	I couldn't keep up with work naturally
2054000	2056000	And the only thing
2056000	2058000	I was wanting to draw
2058000	2059000	Was the girls
2059000	2060000	So I have like
2060000	2062000	Terrible pictures of me drawing the girls
2063000	2065000	Like way back a couple of months ago now
2065000	2067000	Sadly life got in the way
2067000	2069000	But I actually do genuinely think
2069000	2070000	If I ever hit
2071000	2072000	The Jenga with the five gifted
2072000	2073000	Memberships
2073000	2074000	Thank you
2074000	2075000	Congrats to those who caught it with your
2075000	2076000	Face
2076000	2077000	In your face
2078000	2079000	Sorry
2079000	2080000	I'm really
2080000	2081000	If you didn't know
2081000	2082000	There's a character called
2082000	2084000	Candy Roll in Kung Fu Kiosk
2084000	2086000	Her and Sweet and Sour
2086000	2088000	Were my favourite characters
2088000	2090000	And when my voice gets squeaky
2090000	2091000	Internally
2091000	2092000	Not externally
2092000	2093000	But internally
2093000	2094000	Because of the
2095000	2096000	You hear yourself differently
2096000	2097000	From out loud
2098000	2099000	I sound like
2099000	2100000	Candy Roll
2100000	2102000	When I get really high pitched
2102000	2103000	And
2103000	2105000	I know all her voice lines
2105000	2106000	Was it
2106000	2107000	Echo Lillia
2107000	2108000	When you repeat
2108000	2109000	What you've heard
2109000	2111000	And she's like
2111000	2113000	Kits my candy ass
2113000	2114000	And I just love her
2114000	2115000	I love her so much
2115000	2116000	She's just like
2116000	2117000	Ten out of ten characters
2118000	2119000	Oh my god
2119000	2120000	Gentoo Roller Skates confirmed
2120000	2121000	Sorry
2121000	2122000	Some sort of
2122000	2123000	Girl on Roller Skates
2123000	2124000	I don't care
2124000	2125000	Bimbo!
2125000	2126000	Oh my god
2126000	2127000	We don't have a Bimbo
2128000	2129000	Wait
2129000	2131000	What would the Bimbo be?
2133000	2134000	Maybe like a Bimbo
2134000	2136000	That lures your expectations
2136000	2137000	And then does something
2138000	2139000	Zenil Warrior
2139000	2140000	Thank you for coming
2140000	2141000	A member
2143000	2144000	Roller Skates
2144000	2145000	A Bimbo maid
2145000	2146000	I would need something
2146000	2147000	A bit more than a maid
2147000	2149000	I feel like a maid is very default
2150000	2151000	I don't know
2151000	2152000	A maid
2152000	2153000	A Bimbo maid
2153000	2155000	That is quite nice though
2156000	2157000	Bimbo maid is cute
2157000	2158000	Because then she can
2158000	2159000	Spill stuff on you
2159000	2160000	All the time
2160000	2161000	And then before you know
2163000	2164000	Bimbo
2164000	2165000	Possum
2165000	2166000	A possum
2166000	2167000	Muds
2167000	2168000	Remove this man's testicles
2168000	2169000	Possum
2169000	2170000	Possum
2170000	2171000	Possum
2171000	2172000	Possum
2172000	2173000	Possum
2173000	2174000	Possum
2174000	2175000	Possum
2175000	2176000	As in the thing in the
2176000	2177000	That goes
2186000	2188000	Anonymous
2188000	2190000	I'm so conflicted about who you're
2190000	2192000	Who is my favourite in violour
2192000	2193000	Please hypnotise me
2193000	2195000	Please hypnotise me to stay loyal to you mummy
2195000	2197000	Keep that thought in mind
2197000	2199000	Not for what you think
2199000	2201000	Because next week
2201000	2203000	We may or may not be rating
2203000	2205000	A very unique audio roleplay
2205000	2207000	Paul Lott
2207000	2209000	That involves me
2209000	2211000	And the girls
2213000	2216000	Maybe that kind of script
2216000	2218000	Perhaps sea queen script
2219000	2221000	Might solidify
2221000	2223000	Who your choice is at the allure
2223000	2225000	I am not a jealous mother
2225000	2226000	I assure you
2227000	2229000	I wish to share all
2229000	2230000	All the goodness
2230000	2232000	All the spice
2234000	2235000	I have clear ideas
2235000	2237000	A possum are kind of cute
2238000	2240000	A masochistic maid is
2240000	2241000	Metta
2241000	2243000	But it never goes out of the meta
2243000	2245000	I was debating on when to get membership
2245000	2246000	And then I decided
2246000	2247000	If it's not on the day
2247000	2248000	Strongly offers
2248000	2251000	50 cent butt smashes
2251000	2253000	What day will it be
2253000	2255000	Honestly do you think conventions
2255000	2257000	Would let us get away with that
2257000	2259000	Like obviously I'll be wearing a mask
2259000	2261000	And I'll have a little wig
2261000	2263000	So my hair is the same
2263000	2264000	But like
2264000	2266000	I feel like no one can stop
2266000	2267000	You're like
2267000	2268000	Oh what you gonna do
2268000	2270000	A reefling lies down on the floor
2270000	2271000	And I quickly butt bash him
2271000	2272000	And then get back up again
2272000	2274000	Like is that kickable to get out of the corner
2274000	2276000	I feel like that's like such a baby thing
2276000	2277000	Like oops
2277000	2279000	I tripped and landed on my reeflings face
2279000	2281000	Oh no
2281000	2282000	Nah that'd be amazing
2282000	2283000	Depends I guess
2283000	2285000	Because it'd be really weird
2285000	2287000	Messaging the convention and being like
2287000	2288000	Hey
2288000	2290000	Am I allowed to
2290000	2292000	Fall on the faces
2292000	2293000	Of reeflings
2293000	2295000	Question mark
2295000	2296000	Am I allowed
2296000	2298000	Well if they allowed stepping
2298000	2300000	Because then you can start to argue
2300000	2301000	Like oh but you allow other
2301000	2303000	VTubers to step on them
2303000	2304000	Did you know that is also
2304000	2306000	Bexley bestifying
2306000	2307000	So why is it
2307000	2309000	When I trip and fall on a reeflings face
2309000	2310000	With my
2310000	2312000	My arms
2312000	2314000	That's unacceptable
2314000	2316000	But if I step on them
2316000	2318000	That's acceptable
2318000	2321000	Oh my god convention
2321000	2323000	Talk about having double sided
2323000	2325000	Is it because I'm Scottish
2325000	2327000	Convention
2327000	2329000	You can't do that
2329000	2331000	You can't show that you
2331000	2333000	Believe in the British Isles
2333000	2335000	Sorry the
2335000	2338000	You need Kingdom over Scotland
2338000	2340000	Oh my god convention
2340000	2342000	You don't believe in the independence of
2342000	2343000	Scotland
2343000	2345000	Convention
2345000	2347000	You can't say that stuff at
2347000	2348000	Low
2348000	2350000	Yeah anyway
2350000	2352000	Yeah albalfobia
2352000	2353000	Oh my god exactly
2353000	2355000	Sends like asking for trouble
2355000	2357000	Well good thing my name's
2357000	2359000	Johnny because we're making it double
2359000	2361000	That's right me I was
2361000	2362000	The name
2362000	2363000	Sorry I was kidding
2363000	2364000	Going on a
2364000	2365000	Team rockets
2365000	2367000	Blasting off again
2367000	2369000	Oh wait that's not what they sound like
2369000	2371000	That sounded like cream
2371000	2373000	Please be careful not to fall
2373000	2375000	What
2375000	2377000	What's
2377000	2379000	As
2379000	2382000	Team rockets blasting off again
2382000	2384000	It's kinda there it's kinda there
2384000	2386000	Yeah yeah
2386000	2388000	Convention what do you mean
2388000	2390000	So there's a possibility
2390000	2392000	In a certain timeline that
2392000	2395000	I may or may not
2395000	2398000	Be able to make it to our convention
2398000	2401000	I would love to do that
2401000	2403000	But the only problem is
2403000	2405000	We have a bomb
2405000	2407000	And I'd actually need to hire
2407000	2409000	A bodyguard
2409000	2411000	Two bodyguards or one bodyguard
2411000	2413000	Bro I'm gonna be so embarrassed
2413000	2415000	Messaging security is like
2415000	2417000	A private security comment being like
2417000	2419000	Hey I basically need
2419000	2421000	Two security persons
2421000	2423000	To follow me around a convention
2423000	2425000	Is that fine
2425000	2427000	Like for bodyguard
2427000	2429000	Well I feel like the reeflings would bodyguard me pretty much
2429000	2431000	So like any shitters would like
2431000	2433000	You know get eaten up
2433000	2435000	I thought this
2435000	2437000	Thumbnail said backshot
2437000	2439000	Bro you've been on the patreon a lot too much
2439000	2441000	Okay that bodyguard
2441000	2443000	All me three four
2443000	2445000	Four is quite a lot
2445000	2447000	It's because you're Scottish
2447000	2449000	Nearly
2449000	2451000	Nearly even
2451000	2453000	United with the UK
2453000	2455000	I've spotted no I can't read that
2455000	2457000	Five might be a good number
2457000	2459000	Five little reeflings
2459000	2461000	Yeah paychecks a paycheck
2461000	2463000	Literally
2463000	2465000	The bodyguards just watching me
2465000	2467000	Like sit on everyone's face
2467000	2469000	Being like what have I been hired for
2469000	2471000	I thought it was a convention
2471000	2473000	For like weebs or something
2473000	2475000	Like not understanding this like for retubers
2477000	2479000	We'd probably get weirder requests
2479000	2481000	Eh plausible
2481000	2485000	True blood reeflings would be natural bodyguards
2485000	2489000	I think you'd have to hire professional security
2489000	2491000	Yeah no that's not the planet
2491000	2493000	A sniper too
2493000	2495000	Steady I'm not trying to take anyone's heats off
2495000	2497000	Okay and what is this
2497000	2499000	France when Star Wars got released
2499000	2501000	Did you know
2501000	2503000	That in France when Star Wars got released
2503000	2505000	Was the last public beheading
2507000	2509000	What if they are also reeflings
2509000	2511000	The bodyguards
2511000	2513000	I don't think bodyguards with a full time job
2513000	2515000	Have enough time to
2515000	2517000	Listen to me Japanese
2517000	2519000	About anything and everything that comes to my head
2519000	2521000	What yeah it's true
2521000	2523000	The year that Star Wars came out
2523000	2525000	Which is
2525000	2527000	19
2527000	2529000	7
2529000	2531000	What
2531000	2533000	Year did first Star Wars
2537000	2539000	1977
2539000	2541000	Was the last year there was a public
2541000	2543000	Execution in France
2543000	2545000	And also just happens to be the year
2545000	2547000	That Star Wars first came out
2547000	2549000	The evening
2549000	2551000	I've been at home
2551000	2553000	I have a full time job
2553000	2555000	I can hear you yapping and so why not
2555000	2557000	How though
2557000	2559000	Aren't you getting distracted at work
2561000	2563000	Can I give you a bone bone at work
2563000	2565000	When we do the ASMR stream please
2567000	2569000	The thought I have that kind of power
2569000	2571000	It's too much power
2571000	2573000	Unlimited power
2573000	2575000	Speaking of Star Wars
2575000	2577000	Unlimited power
2577000	2579000	I was freaked me out that scene
2579000	2581000	You have done that to me at work
2581000	2583000	Yeah stop you're gonna give me an ego
2583000	2585000	It's like one of my favourite friggin concepts
2587000	2589000	Oh my god should I write a joystick
2589000	2591000	About doing it at work
2591000	2593000	And being subtle
2593000	2595000	No I don't want you to get fired
2595000	2597000	I don't want to encourage such behaviours
2597000	2599000	That you didn't get fired
2599000	2601000	As much as you may despise
2601000	2603000	Work as a whole
2603000	2605000	It's good for routine for the brain
2605000	2607000	It's good for socialisation
2607000	2609000	It's good for keeping you active
2609000	2611000	And the neurons firing
2613000	2615000	Maybe capitalism won a little bit there
2615000	2617000	But maybe reduce it to a 4 day work week
2621000	2623000	4 day work week and not putting up to 10 hours
2623000	2625000	Cause that's outrageous
2625000	2627000	And then
2627000	2629000	For those who choose to not
2629000	2631000	Those who work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday
2631000	2633000	Get a cheeky bit of overtime as well
2633000	2635000	Cause that's not common
2635000	2637000	In all countries
2637000	2639000	Anyway before the tinfoil
2639000	2641000	Hat goes back on
2641000	2643000	It's been 44 minutes already

2693000	2695000	The brightness was so not bright
2695000	2697000	But on my screens it was bright
2697000	2699000	Hold on hydration

2759000	2761000	I insert the shells

2765000	2767000	Oh my god this back
2767000	2769000	Like the faded background music
2769000	2771000	Shotgun
2771000	2773000	Shooting yourself with a blank
2773000	2775000	Skips the dealer's turn
2779000	2781000	If there's two blanks
2781000	2783000	I shoot myself

2791000	2793000	We're at 50-50
2797000	2799000	I'd rather give it to him
2799000	2801000	Shooting yourself
2801000	2803000	No I want to shoot him
2803000	2805000	I shoot the dealer
2805000	2807000	50-50

2825000	2827000	Three rounds
2827000	2829000	Two blanks
2829000	2831000	Odds are what
2831000	2833000	They entered the chamber
2833000	2835000	In a hidden sequence
2835000	2837000	Free live
2837000	2839000	I want to shoot
2839000	2841000	Sorry, three live, two blank
2843000	2845000	Okay, now it's 50-50
2845000	2847000	Two live, two blank
2855000	2857000	Okay, okay, that's good
2857000	2859000	That's good because now it's two live
2859000	2861000	One blank, okay

2879000	2881000	On stream?
2881000	2883000	Bruh
2883000	2885000	The game

2893000	2895000	I don't know why but Crash Bandicoot was so dark
2897000	2899000	Wait, is he the one that read me then?
2909000	2911000	Welcome back
2911000	2913000	Hi
2917000	2919000	I thought this game took like 20 minutes to
2919000	2921000	One live round
2921000	2923000	Two blanks, okay
2923000	2925000	The odds are in my favor for a blank
2925000	2927000	So I'm gonna
2931000	2933000	Okay, okay, safe
2933000	2935000	And then again the 50
2935000	2937000	Surely I wouldn't lose the 50-50
2937000	2939000	The second time around
2945000	2947000	Are you serious?
2947000	2949000	What the heck, I thought this was an easy game
2951000	2953000	Careful now
2955000	2957000	Oh, goodness me
2957000	2959000	Right, three lives, two blanks
2963000	2965000	I used up all my luck
2965000	2967000	On my daughters, that's what's happened
2967000	2969000	Right, three lives, shoot the dealer
2979000	2981000	Okay, the game is feeling kind
2981000	2983000	Because there's now two live and one blank
2985000	2987000	The game is trying to let me win now
2987000	2989000	I'm just gonna keep shooting
2991000	2993000	Okay, okay, we did it
2993000	2995000	We did it, we did it
2995000	2997000	See, I do not gamble
2997000	2999000	I have absolutely no interest in gambling
2999000	3001000	And on the way to one replay
3001000	3003000	You did it
3003000	3005000	Let's go
3005000	3007000	Let's make this a little more
3007000	3009000	Interesting
3009000	3011000	Sorry, I'm getting comfy on my chair
3011000	3013000	I'm sitting on my toes
3013000	3015000	Two items each
3015000	3017000	More items before
3017000	3019000	Every load, every load
3019000	3021000	This is my kind of game
3021000	3023000	Oh, sheebie
3023000	3025000	You didn't tell me you were a part of this game
3025000	3027000	Sheebie
3027000	3029000	You do not
3029000	3031000	Sheebie
3031000	3033000	Four
3033000	3035000	One live, one blank
3035000	3037000	Yes
3037000	3039000	So what do you do?
3039000	3041000	Dealer
3041000	3045000	Skips the next turn
3047000	3049000	Does that mean if I sheebie him up?
3053000	3055000	So I can just shoot both into him
3055000	3057000	And win
3057000	3059000	Yeah
3059000	3061000	And then I get to shoot again
3061000	3063000	Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm getting it
3063000	3065000	I'm getting it, I'm getting it
3065000	3067000	So we win
3067000	3069000	Take that
3071000	3073000	Okay
3073000	3075000	Now what?
3075000	3077000	Oh, I get more items every round
3077000	3079000	Okay, you should come round
3079000	3081000	Oh, beer
3083000	3085000	Meh
3085000	3087000	What was that? No, no, no, come back out
3087000	3089000	What was that? It said God
3089000	3091000	A magnifying glass
3091000	3093000	What was that? It said God
3093000	3095000	Two
3095000	3097000	Oh, it's a 50-50 again
3097000	3099000	50-50 again
3099000	3101000	What does beer do?
3101000	3103000	Racks the shotgun
3103000	3105000	EJX
3105000	3107000	Current shell
3107000	3109000	Racks the shotgun
3115000	3117000	Check the current round in the chamber
3117000	3119000	Whoa
3119000	3121000	It's a blank
3121000	3123000	So I'll shoot me
3123000	3125000	Rack equals pump
3125000	3127000	I'll pump you in a minute
3127000	3129000	Don't you worry
3129000	3131000	I don't know if that means the same
3131000	3133000	But in Scots that means I'm gonna do
3133000	3135000	Yeah
3135000	3137000	Okay
3141000	3143000	Well, I did a blank
3143000	3145000	So two to one
3145000	3147000	Okay
3147000	3149000	Okay
3149000	3151000	Oh, per dealer is going down
3151000	3153000	But I don't wish him any ill
3153000	3155000	Well, he just looks creepy
3155000	3157000	But I don't... He's taking a cigarette
3157000	3159000	You know, a cigarette
3159000	3161000	What? Cigarettes are bad for your health
3161000	3163000	Oh
3163000	3165000	Yeah
3165000	3167000	To health
3175000	3177000	Bro
3183000	3187000	He heals up and does double damage to me
3187000	3189000	You wet fart
3189000	3191000	Release me
3195000	3197000	Oh, I've lost this
3197000	3199000	I don't know what kinda
3199000	3201000	I don't know what kinda stuff
3201000	3203000	be going on
3203000	3205000	Sure, I'll take that and that
3205000	3207000	What?
3207000	3209000	Two blanks, three live
3209000	3211000	Oh, I'm not winning this one
3211000	3213000	Oh
3213000	3215000	This is such a creative game
3215000	3217000	I'll give it though, I like this
3217000	3219000	It's live
3219000	3221000	Well, you'll never guess who I'm shooting
3225000	3227000	That's so satisfying
3229000	3231000	I like how it's not too loud
3231000	3233000	I need to lower in-game volume
3233000	3235000	Or it's all good to go
3235000	3237000	Again
3241000	3243000	Okay
3243000	3245000	It's fine, all good
3245000	3247000	Should've cuffed him first
3247000	3249000	Can I do multiple items per round?
3249000	3251000	Wow, I got two blanks
3251000	3253000	The game's feeling nice to me
3253000	3255000	Right, I think I can just shoot him
3255000	3257000	Cause there's only one left and it's live
3257000	3259000	Yeah, take that
3259000	3261000	You wet fart
3261000	3263000	Okay, we're back on an even playing field
3265000	3267000	Okay, what items, what items
3267000	3269000	What a curious game
3271000	3273000	God, okay
3273000	3275000	All I'm getting is handcuffs and beer
3275000	3277000	50-50
3277000	3279000	Right
3279000	3281000	Right, I'll handcuff him
3283000	3285000	Please take these handcuffs
3285000	3287000	Oh, it's a harem
3287000	3289000	Right, eject the current shell
3289000	3291000	It's 50-50, this will change the odds
3291000	3293000	Out of 50-50
3293000	3295000	Shit!
3295000	3297000	Wait, okay, so it's live now
3297000	3299000	The odds are more likely it's a live round
3301000	3303000	Oh, we're doing it
3303000	3305000	We have probability
3305000	3307000	Okay, now it's likely
3307000	3309000	to be blank because
3309000	3311000	the odds are now one live to
3311000	3313000	two blank or three blank
3313000	3315000	Oh, I don't like this part
3315000	3317000	Okay, okay
3317000	3319000	It's fine, it's fine, it's fine
3321000	3323000	Right, and now it's again
3323000	3325000	back to being live
3325000	3327000	Unless
3327000	3329000	Put the gun down
3329000	3331000	It's not gonna change my mind
3331000	3333000	Live
3333000	3335000	No!
3335000	3337000	I'm not gonna make every blank
3341000	3343000	Aw, he knows what's inside
3343000	3345000	Very interesting
3349000	3351000	Yeah, I'm not surprised
3353000	3355000	It's a 1v1, careful now
3355000	3357000	Oh no
3361000	3363000	I don't know what
3363000	3365000	I don't even
3365000	3367000	I genuinely do not know what's
3367000	3369000	in this
3369000	3371000	There's no point in racking the shell
3371000	3373000	Is there?
3373000	3375000	Cuff him, everyone says cuff him
3375000	3377000	Right, I'll listen to the replays
3377000	3379000	Cause you guys are smart
3379000	3381000	Right, I've cuffed him
3381000	3383000	And then I'm gonna
3383000	3385000	Okay
3387000	3389000	Oh, I just ended the round
3389000	3391000	What?
3391000	3393000	Yes, I'll absolutely take that
3393000	3395000	Oh, and a ciggy
3395000	3397000	Giazawi
3397000	3399000	Whoa, the odds are very high
3399000	3401000	for a live round
3401000	3403000	Sorry, look
3403000	3405000	I'm not the smartest, right
3405000	3407000	Regain a charge, I'll have a wee puff puff pass
3407000	3409000	Yes, nicotine
3409000	3411000	No, it's not good
3411000	3413000	I actually did it
3413000	3415000	A blank, right
3415000	3417000	Okay, okay
3417000	3419000	Me
3419000	3421000	Okay, that's good to go
3421000	3423000	Okay, so now it's like
3423000	3425000	5 to 1
3425000	3427000	We're just gonna shoot
3431000	3433000	What a curious game
3433000	3435000	I'm very intrigued by this
3435000	3437000	I'm intrigued by the dev team
3437000	3439000	I'm intrigued by the graph
3439000	3441000	One reflying, and on one
3443000	3445000	Yeah
3445000	3447000	Long last, we arrive at the final showdown
3447000	3449000	No more defibrillators
3449000	3451000	No more blood transfusions
3451000	3453000	Now me and you
3453000	3455000	We are dancing on the edge of life and death
3459000	3461000	Eh
3469000	3471000	Eh
3473000	3475000	Four items each
3475000	3477000	Handcuff
3477000	3479000	Handcuff
3479000	3481000	Magnifying glass
3481000	3483000	Handcuff
3483000	3485000	I'm starting to forget about my feet going on
3485000	3487000	Eh
3487000	3489000	You know the drill
3491000	3493000	Is he gonna handcuff me?
3495000	3497000	If I handcuff him
3497000	3499000	I can double
3499000	3501000	I can double shoot
3501000	3503000	And the odds are he's gonna get shot
3505000	3507000	Okay, there you go
3507000	3509000	Okay, we're doing it
3509000	3511000	Uh
3511000	3513000	Doesn't tell you what his health actually is
3513000	3515000	But he's
3515000	3517000	So we can just double

3685000	3687000	We're gonna heal
3687000	3689000	Because we do need a cheeky bit of health
3689000	3691000	Because it is
3691000	3693000	Three live, two blank
3695000	3697000	Did we take a peak
3697000	3699000	Or did we
3699000	3701000	Wait, no, just taking a peak matter
3701000	3703000	If he's cuffed
3703000	3705000	Well, because yeah

3719000	3721000	You can just double shoot, doesn't matter what the results are
3721000	3723000	Right, what I've already forgotten
3723000	3725000	What we're at, is it one live, two blank
3725000	3727000	Or two live, one blank
3727000	3729000	Heals, he's got two heals on the board
3729000	3731000	And he's got double son off
3733000	3735000	Now it's two live, one blank
3735000	3737000	Sugar, did you
3737000	3739000	Yeah, he's gonna shoot me
3739000	3741000	No, for two health
3741000	3743000	He's gonna shoot me for the son off
3743000	3745000	Oh, this is
3745000	3747000	My odds
3747000	3749000	Wow
3749000	3751000	Gosh

3767000	3769000	It's two blank now
3769000	3771000	Yeah
3771000	3773000	That's why I shouldn't have cuffed
3775000	3777000	Remaining ammo, zero
3777000	3779000	They're both blank
3783000	3785000	I'm not right, I need to focus up
3785000	3787000	I need a piece of paper or something
3789000	3791000	It was a 1v1
3791000	3793000	Right, items, cuffs
3793000	3795000	Peak, peak
3795000	3797000	Oh, we've got a double son off
3797000	3799000	If we peak, we could get a double
3799000	3801000	Four to two
3803000	3805000	Four
3805000	3807000	To two
3807000	3809000	Cuff him

3831000	3833000	Oh, that was satisfying
3835000	3837000	So now we are three live
3837000	3839000	Two blank
3839000	3841000	Now it is a two in three
3847000	3849000	Oh, dear

3873000	3875000	On life support, I believe there's
3875000	3877000	Unless that's it
3877000	3879000	I don't know
3879000	3881000	Okay
3883000	3885000	Well, I'm handcuffed, he's won

3891000	3893000	I'm handcuffed

3905000	3907000	Double damage
3907000	3909000	Double damage
3909000	3911000	Double damage
3911000	3913000	Oh, what are these
3913000	3915000	Live, live, live, live
3915000	3917000	Five, live, three
3919000	3921000	Goodness me
3921000	3923000	Heals don't work anymore
3923000	3925000	Oh, you can't even heal anymore
3925000	3927000	Oh, that's why the game is giving me critical damage
3927000	3929000	Let's see what I'm working with
3929000	3931000	Blank
3931000	3933000	Well
3933000	3935000	Five to three
3935000	3937000	So now it's five to two
3939000	3941000	And then
3941000	3943000	We'll just check again
3945000	3947000	Okay, live
3947000	3949000	And then we'll do double damage
3951000	3953000	Unfortunately, the odds are not in our favor
3953000	3955000	But, hey-ho
3955000	3957000	So that's four to
3957000	3959000	Two
3959000	3961000	We're not gonna make it
3963000	3965000	Unless he throws
3965000	3967000	We ain't gonna make it
3967000	3969000	Oh wait, what?
3973000	3975000	Wait
3975000	3977000	Are you saying there's a chance?
3977000	3979000	If it's in the chamber, are you saying
3979000	3981000	There's a chance?
3989000	3991000	Against all odds?
3999000	4001000	What?
4005000	4007000	What?
4009000	4011000	What did I do with it?

4155000	4157000	Mobile phone

4169000	4171000	insight from the future
4173000	4175000	Swap the polarity
4179000	4181000	I think we'll just cuff
4181000	4183000	and double shoot
4183000	4185000	If both of the blanks happen
4185000	4187000	to be in there
4187000	4189000	Wow I have rubbish luck
4191000	4193000	That's fine
4193000	4195000	Now it's a 50-50
4195000	4197000	If I shoot a blank at him
4197000	4199000	I'm going to be
4199000	4201000	Should I go all?
4203000	4205000	Not looking
4205000	4207000	Okay rough start
4207000	4209000	Double or nothing
4209000	4211000	It was a double start
4211000	4213000	Okay
4217000	4219000	Two health already
4219000	4221000	We've just gotten started on this
4221000	4223000	He's got health up
4223000	4225000	Hydration check
4229000	4231000	Okay we can pump one out of the chamber
4231000	4233000	We can heal and we can swap
4233000	4235000	Another polarity
4235000	4237000	Wow
4237000	4239000	Interesting curious
4239000	4241000	Again with a blank
4241000	4243000	I am going to
4243000	4245000	Puff one out of the chamber
4247000	4249000	To see what the odds are
4249000	4251000	Okay now it's 50-50
4251000	4253000	So I'm going to heal up because we already know what it's going to happen
4255000	4257000	And then
4257000	4259000	We're going to saw
4259000	4261000	it off
4261000	4263000	And we're going all in on double damage
4263000	4265000	against him
4265000	4267000	Dealer
4267000	4269000	Use the phone
4273000	4275000	Right I'll use the phone
4275000	4277000	Sorry it's the phone about the current round
4277000	4279000	or the next round
4279000	4281000	Oh my god he's doing
4281000	4283000	Double damage against me
4283000	4285000	That's so bad
4285000	4287000	Right I'll do the phone my apologies

4291000	4293000	Careful re-flowing
4293000	4295000	Re-flowing
4295000	4297000	Wouldn't want to be dancing to death
4301000	4303000	Let's see you
4303000	4305000	What is you
4305000	4307000	Okay
4307000	4309000	Ring ring hello
4309000	4311000	Three lie four blank
4311000	4313000	The game is trying its best to help me right now
4315000	4317000	A mysterious voice
4323000	4325000	How smart
4325000	4327000	Do you think I am
4327000	4329000	Reflings to be able to
4329000	4331000	retain the information
4331000	4333000	That on the sixth shell
4333000	4335000	It's blank
4339000	4341000	How smart do you think I am
4341000	4343000	What is this a pipe bomb
4343000	4345000	Steal an item
4345000	4347000	And use it
4347000	4349000	Well
4349000	4351000	Oh no
4351000	4353000	Oh that's exactly what happened
4353000	4355000	They put adrenaline directly
4355000	4357000	into your bloodstream
4357000	4359000	What was that medicine box
4359000	4361000	I wonder what this is
4361000	4363000	I don't have it yet
4365000	4367000	There's nothing I can do
4369000	4371000	Other than cuff them
4371000	4373000	and double shoot
4373000	4375000	What
4381000	4383000	That also means the fetus isn't going to be blank
4387000	4389000	I just need to send it
4389000	4391000	Sorry I can't
4391000	4393000	No okay
4393000	4395000	So it means like these next few are live
4397000	4399000	Gotta go straight to cuff and meet
4399000	4401000	Okay
4403000	4405000	Okay I've definitely messed up this one
4407000	4409000	What is that
4409000	4411000	A medicine packet
4411000	4413000	He takes a pill
4413000	4415000	Oh I healed
4415000	4417000	Okay that's fine, cigarette or pills heal
4417000	4419000	I know
4421000	4423000	I've lost
4423000	4425000	I've lost
4427000	4429000	Oh no
4429000	4431000	Who is he calling literally
4431000	4433000	Aw that's such a shame
4433000	4435000	Wait
4435000	4437000	He put the polarizing effect on
4441000	4443000	Oh no I'm gone
4443000	4445000	Sorry
4445000	4447000	Right I didn't know how the phone worked
4447000	4449000	Not that it probably would have helped
4449000	4451000	Oh by the way the fifth one's a blank
4451000	4453000	Oh thanks for that mate
4453000	4455000	Let me just add it into my fucking calculator
4455000	4457000	And have the largest IQ
4457000	4459000	And my brain goes three-sided
4459000	4461000	You know the average person who can only retain
4461000	4463000	Like freaking what
4463000	4465000	Four bits of information at a time
4465000	4467000	Like come on give me a chance game
4469000	4471000	Let me write it down, give me a wee piece of paper
4471000	4473000	And I'll write it down just like this
4481000	4483000	He kicked the hell out of this cuttlefish
4483000	4485000	Literally I'm calamari right now
4485000	4487000	By all accounts right
4487000	4489000	Let's try that again
4489000	4491000	Pump one out of the chamber
4491000	4493000	Adrenaline burst, health and double damage
4493000	4495000	Okay
4495000	4497000	Okay we can work with this
4497000	4499000	Four before
4499000	4501000	Two live, three blank
4503000	4505000	What do I do with that information
4507000	4509000	I don't know
4511000	4513000	If three blank should I shoot myself
4517000	4519000	Or should I make the odds known
4519000	4521000	If it's 50-50
4521000	4523000	Three blank, two
4525000	4527000	50-50 double damage
4527000	4529000	Let's go
4529000	4531000	50-50 double damage
4531000	4533000	Two blanks in a row
4533000	4535000	Possibly
4535000	4537000	Oh yes
4539000	4541000	Okay, okay, okay
4541000	4543000	Okay
4547000	4549000	He's gonna pump it out
4549000	4551000	Now it's back to 50-50
4551000	4553000	I'm being cuffed but I do have a blank
4557000	4559000	Yep and then one health damage on me
4559000	4561000	Unless he wants to use the polarizing effect
4561000	4563000	And let me win
4563000	4565000	But that's slightly different
4565000	4567000	Okay, okay, that's good
4567000	4569000	Let him get up, let him get up
4569000	4571000	Good shot
4571000	4573000	Are you squinting me right now
4573000	4575000	Cooper
4575000	4577000	Brian, Blasterman
4579000	4581000	Thank you for the five
4581000	4583000	Cooper and yes I will Blasterman
4583000	4585000	Okay two blank one live
4585000	4587000	I have nothing
4587000	4589000	What's that
4589000	4591000	Medicine, steal his medicine
4591000	4593000	I think I'm gonna steal his health
4593000	4595000	Prevent him from healing up
4599000	4601000	Give me that
4601000	4603000	Give me that
4603000	4605000	What does it do?
4605000	4607000	Why did my head just
4609000	4611000	Two blank one live
4615000	4617000	Two blank one live
4621000	4623000	Okay
4625000	4627000	Medicine is 50% chance one damage
4627000	4629000	And two heal
4629000	4631000	Oh wait is that
4633000	4635000	Okay we are classic 50-50
4635000	4637000	If we get this
4637000	4639000	We have won the first round of doubler nothing
4641000	4643000	Dealer
4645000	4647000	Oh that was a clean round
4647000	4649000	That was a clean round of odds
4651000	4653000	Very clean
4653000	4655000	And on wins, okay
4655000	4657000	I'm taking medicine again
4657000	4659000	Because I didn't realise I could hurt myself with it
4665000	4667000	Okay
4669000	4671000	Oh great
4671000	4673000	Fucking tiddlywink spawn
4673000	4675000	No I'm not taking that
4675000	4677000	Okay what are the rounds
4677000	4679000	Let me know
4679000	4681000	Full eight
4681000	4683000	50-50 full eight
4685000	4687000	Okay
4689000	4691000	Remove one from the chamber
4691000	4693000	Let me know my odds
4693000	4695000	4-4
4697000	4699000	3-4
4705000	4707000	3-3
4707000	4709000	6 total
4709000	4711000	4th shell live
4715000	4717000	Ray
4717000	4719000	Can I just take his fucking heal then
4721000	4723000	6
4723000	4725000	4 is life
4725000	4727000	6 total 4 is life
4729000	4731000	6 total 4 is life
4735000	4737000	So I have to
4737000	4739000	It's most likely a blank
4739000	4741000	You know that
4741000	4743000	If 4 is live in that sequence
4743000	4745000	There are most likely 2 blanks before it
4753000	4755000	Wait
4755000	4757000	Am I an idiot
4757000	4759000	Did I not take a heal
4759000	4761000	Did I not take a cigarette
4761000	4763000	Am I being dumb
4767000	4769000	Did I not
4769000	4771000	2

4789000	4791000	No
4791000	4793000	No

4865000	4867000	I am gonna steal
4867000	4869000	His sawn off and give him 2 damage
4869000	4871000	Now I'm aware he has a heal there

4887000	4889000	The reeflings just told you
4889000	4891000	That mere moments ago that you can't over heal
4891000	4893000	In this game mode and what do you do
4893000	4895000	Reade it over heal
4895000	4897000	You could have had him down to 2
4897000	4899000	You could have had him on the ropes
4899000	4901000	But no no
4901000	4903000	Okay 50-50 odds
4903000	4905000	He's getting insider knowledge

4907000	4909000	Celebrities calling the paparazzi
4909000	4911000	To tell them ahead of time

4947000	4949000	That's okay
4949000	4951000	Let him get up
4951000	4953000	So now there is no blank
4957000	4959000	How can that not count

5055000	5057000	Careful now
5057000	5059000	I'm trying to be careful but I suck
5059000	5061000	Okay
5063000	5065000	If I eject this one
5065000	5067000	This one's blank so I'm gonna shoot myself
5067000	5069000	I'm removing this one
5069000	5071000	The next one is blank
5071000	5073000	So I'm just gonna
5073000	5075000	Play it safe and do that
5077000	5079000	He is using developer luck
5079000	5081000	Remaining ammo
5081000	5083000	Oh my god you guys try to help me so much
5083000	5085000	I'm so bad I'm so sorry
5085000	5087000	Right we can now double
5087000	5089000	Double saw it off at least
5091000	5093000	Why did I get two turns in a room there
5095000	5097000	Wow
5097000	5099000	Well it's now even Steven
5099000	5101000	No it's not cause he has two health and not one
5101000	5103000	Cause I'm dumb
5107000	5109000	What is he doing
5109000	5111000	Polarizing
5111000	5113000	Okay
5113000	5115000	Hiya
5115000	5117000	Dude
5117000	5119000	So bad
5119000	5121000	Oh my goodness this is so hard
5123000	5125000	Yes please
5125000	5127000	Let me try again
5127000	5129000	Let me get up
5129000	5131000	I'm afraid
5131000	5133000	I'm very afraid
5133000	5135000	The force was a blank
5135000	5137000	Yeah that's why I shot myself with it
5141000	5143000	Sorry this must be painful
5143000	5145000	I'm so sorry
5145000	5147000	I'm not very smart
5147000	5149000	You guys didn't figure out I wasn't smart by playing connect 4 with me
5149000	5151000	In old school runescape
5151000	5153000	Anon
5153000	5155000	You know what
5157000	5159000	Yeah that's right
5159000	5161000	Call me big willy
5161000	5163000	Cause I got a big massive willy
5163000	5165000	One
5165000	5167000	Right
5167000	5169000	Let's try hard
5169000	5171000	It's time to try
5171000	5173000	Not two irons or he only got two as well
5173000	5175000	Big willy
5175000	5177000	It's a 50-50
5177000	5179000	Let's try again
5179000	5181000	If it's a 50-50
5181000	5183000	I could just win by doing this
5191000	5193000	But he can do the save to shoot me
5197000	5199000	But he can still
5199000	5201000	He can still hurt me
5201000	5203000	Cause the first one wasn't
5203000	5205000	Wait what
5205000	5207000	Oh if you shoot yourself you get to play a second turn
5213000	5215000	It's finally starting to make a little bit of sense
5221000	5223000	Health?
5223000	5225000	But I can't overheal so don't get jealous
5225000	5227000	Whoa
5227000	5229000	Why so many irons
5229000	5231000	Oh he got loads of irons too
5231000	5233000	Two life three blank
5233000	5235000	Three
5253000	5255000	Three blank
5255000	5257000	No it's 50-50
5257000	5259000	No
5259000	5261000	It's
5261000	5263000	Oh god
5263000	5265000	I can't use my brain and talk at the same time
5265000	5267000	Just let me see what it is
5267000	5269000	Please
5269000	5271000	Okay
5271000	5273000	So if I shoot myself
5273000	5275000	I get to go again
5277000	5279000	And then I get to double shotgun
5279000	5281000	Barrel you
5287000	5289000	Am I doing it?
5289000	5291000	I think I'm doing it
5295000	5297000	Why is my luck so poor
5299000	5301000	There's all life now
5305000	5307000	What does polarize do?
5307000	5309000	You could have inverted
5309000	5311000	And then sawn for the win
5311000	5313000	Wait that works backwards as well
5313000	5315000	If I know it's blank
5315000	5317000	Polarize it to change it
5325000	5327000	This must be the most painful place
5327000	5329000	Or you've ever seen
5329000	5331000	I even think we're going to be able to do it
5331000	5333000	In time for Shibi's monetization stream
5333000	5335000	Okay
5335000	5337000	I didn't realize polarizing
5337000	5339000	Swapped
5339000	5341000	The
5341000	5343000	Oh shit I did not pay attention
5343000	5345000	To how many live in
5345000	5347000	You know
5351000	5353000	If I know it's a blank use polarizing
5353000	5355000	Got it
5355000	5357000	If I know it's a blank use polarizing
5357000	5359000	Okay it's alive
5359000	5361000	It's alive
5361000	5363000	So I am going to
5363000	5365000	Steal your double damage
5367000	5369000	Steal his saw
5369000	5371000	Steal his double damage
5371000	5373000	If I know it's a blank
5373000	5375000	Polarize
5375000	5377000	If I know it's a blank
5377000	5379000	Polarize
5383000	5385000	You've already finished the game

5481000	5483000	Oh my god I was so
5483000	5485000	I freaking clicked it and my brain was like
5485000	5487000	Wait a minute you were supposed to do something
5487000	5489000	Freaking polarize

5507000	5509000	Inspect element
5509000	5511000	Inspect element blank
5511000	5513000	Blank found
5513000	5515000	Polarize effect added
5515000	5517000	Polarizing
5517000	5519000	And then what
5519000	5521000	Shoot myself or shoot him with polarize on
5523000	5525000	Shoot him with polarize on
5525000	5527000	Man she sure is pretty
5527000	5529000	Yeah that's all I got going for me
5529000	5531000	This feature of model is adorable
5531000	5533000	Okay shoot him
5535000	5537000	We did it
5537000	5539000	I was so sorry
5541000	5543000	Shoot um right we did it
5543000	5545000	Willy wins
5545000	5547000	Big Willy wins
5547000	5549000	Imagine if this is the run I went on
5549000	5551000	And it's the one I call myself Willy on
5551000	5553000	Right
5553000	5555000	Okay let's see what we're working with baby
5555000	5557000	Rejection
5557000	5559000	Calling
5559000	5561000	Focus right
5561000	5563000	Uh
5563000	5565000	For help on big Willy 50-50 odds
5565000	5567000	Okay
5567000	5569000	He can see he can cuff and he can double damage
5573000	5575000	Maybe the phone
5575000	5577000	Can tell me if what's first
5577000	5579000	If not I'll just use the magnifying glass
5581000	5583000	That's absolutely nothing
5585000	5587000	Can you not pick like the second bullet
5587000	5589000	So I'll actually remember
5589000	5591000	Right I don't have polarizing
5591000	5593000	So I can shoot myself for free
5597000	5599000	That's one
5599000	5601000	So odds are
5601000	5603000	I can just shoot him
5607000	5609000	Nooo
5609000	5611000	Are you fucking kidding me
5613000	5615000	High odds of being
5615000	5617000	Live literally the seventh shell is blind
5617000	5619000	So and
5619000	5621000	And two bullets have been utilized
5621000	5623000	This is the third bullet
5623000	5625000	Being utilized
5627000	5629000	Right
5637000	5639000	So the odds of this one being live
5639000	5641000	Are high again
5641000	5643000	Oh no
5643000	5645000	Okay
5647000	5649000	Is that four shots now
5651000	5653000	So then five and six are live
5657000	5659000	Five is live
5661000	5663000	So
5673000	5675000	What
5675000	5677000	What
5677000	5679000	Does this game want from me
5679000	5681000	What does this game want from me
5683000	5685000	My odds
5685000	5687000	I know you can't rely on odds
5687000	5689000	That's just how odds work
5689000	5691000	My odds are
5691000	5693000	Astronomically
5695000	5697000	Right Willy's definitely
5697000	5699000	We can't even do it as Willy
5699000	5701000	We have to go back to our roots
5701000	5703000	Cause this clearly isn't working
5705000	5707000	It wants you to suffer
5707000	5709000	My poor Willy
5709000	5711000	My poor Willy got blown off
5711000	5713000	Right
5713000	5715000	I'm actually
5715000	5717000	I'm like do I get a piece of paper
5717000	5719000	Cause I might
5719000	5721000	These are good items
5721000	5723000	What are the odds
5723000	5725000	Give me a 50-50
5725000	5727000	We've got a 50-50
5727000	5729000	I can't overheal past two
5729000	5731000	If it's
5731000	5733000	50-50
5737000	5739000	Let me see
5739000	5741000	What's
5741000	5743000	Or eject
5743000	5745000	I might be able to
5745000	5747000	Eject 50-50
5747000	5749000	And tell me what's up
5749000	5751000	Right taking it out alive
5751000	5753000	So if we're gonna get a blank
5753000	5755000	We're gonna steal the polarizing
5755000	5757000	No it's live
5757000	5759000	I really don't have a double
5759000	5761000	Oh sugar but he has the polarizing
5769000	5771000	Well next to a blank
5771000	5773000	So if he uses polarizing
5773000	5775000	Then he's won
5775000	5777000	I think
5777000	5779000	No he can only do one damage to me this round
5781000	5783000	Okay okay
5783000	5785000	Steal the car
5785000	5787000	I don't think
5787000	5789000	That would have
5789000	5791000	Bro
5791000	5793000	Bro it's not looking good
5793000	5795000	Why is this game so hard
5795000	5797000	I just need you guys to like
5797000	5799000	Send me your gaming footage
5799000	5801000	So I just commentate over it
5801000	5803000	Cause this is getting so bad
5803000	5805000	Careful now
5805000	5807000	All I've been told this game is careful now
5807000	5809000	Careful now
5809000	5811000	Careful now
5811000	5813000	Yeah yeah yeah
5813000	5815000	They're both blank we know
5815000	5817000	We know they're blank
5817000	5819000	Well at least I
5819000	5821000	Have a cigarette
5823000	5825000	Right
5825000	5827000	Two live three blank
5827000	5829000	But he doesn't have a polarizing
5829000	5831000	So blank actually means
5831000	5833000	Blank in this game
5835000	5837000	I'm gonna steal his
5837000	5839000	Cigarette
5839000	5841000	No
5843000	5845000	Can I get a vase
5845000	5847000	Three blank two live
5847000	5849000	Can I get a vase
5851000	5853000	So the three blank are up ahead
5853000	5855000	So odds are
5855000	5857000	This is blank
5861000	5863000	Can I steal his health
5865000	5867000	I don't want him to heal
5869000	5871000	Yeah this is blank
5871000	5873000	It's my guess
5873000	5875000	Oh for fuck's sake I keep being greedy
5875000	5877000	Right this is blank sorry
5877000	5879000	I'm guessing but
5879000	5881000	Yeah okay odds are
5881000	5883000	Right I'm happy with that
5883000	5885000	I'm happy with that
5885000	5887000	Right we're gonna take a peek
5889000	5891000	Blank again wow
5891000	5893000	Blank again
5895000	5897000	And then the rest are live
5897000	5899000	In a room
5899000	5901000	Well unfortunately he's gonna get a lick in on me
5913000	5915000	How do I suck so badly
5915000	5917000	I'm not being funny I'm getting
5917000	5919000	Absolutely rolled
5919000	5921000	I'm getting
5921000	5923000	Just
5923000	5925000	They're making a mockery out of me
5925000	5927000	They're making an absolute mockery out of me
5929000	5931000	Does this guy even have a name
5935000	5937000	Okay phone a friend
5937000	5939000	Adrenaline
5939000	5941000	Oh he got a heal I'm gonna steal his heal
5941000	5943000	Right it's a 50-50
5943000	5945000	You need to start comboing the items
5945000	5947000	Oh I'm too dumb for that though
5951000	5953000	That's actually
5953000	5955000	An injection into
5957000	5959000	That
5959000	5961000	Adrenaline into your heart
5961000	5963000	Which basically forces it to go
5967000	5969000	Blank
5969000	5971000	I'm just shooting
5971000	5973000	So anyway I start blasting
5973000	5975000	Cause I'm unable to keep up with them
5975000	5977000	Right there we go boom
5977000	5979000	Oh wait I actually won out of just pure frustration
5979000	5981000	We won that round
5981000	5983000	Anyway start blasting
5983000	5985000	We did it we made it to round 2
5985000	5987000	Of double or nothing
5989000	5991000	I've still yet to make it to round 3
5995000	5997000	Okay let's see what we get
5997000	5999000	Cough, double
5999000	6001000	Damage, adrenaline
6001000	6003000	Not medicine
6003000	6005000	Medicine that's not really medicine
6007000	6009000	Too blind
6011000	6013000	Does he have a polarizer he does
6021000	6023000	Phone and a friend
6027000	6029000	Wow okay
6031000	6033000	Steel
6033000	6035000	Polarizer
6037000	6039000	Shoot him
6039000	6041000	Steel polarizer
6041000	6043000	Shoot him
6043000	6045000	Yes
6047000	6049000	Steel polarizer
6049000	6051000	Shoot him
6053000	6055000	Steel and then shoot
6057000	6059000	Okay
6059000	6061000	Then he'll shoot blank on me
6063000	6065000	Cause we know it doesn't have anything in it
6065000	6067000	And then double sawing off
6069000	6071000	Oh he's healing
6073000	6075000	Okay
6077000	6079000	So let him shoot
6079000	6081000	That's just fine cause it's blank
6081000	6083000	Oh
6083000	6085000	Forgot he can get an extra turn
6087000	6089000	If he shoots himself
6089000	6091000	I keep
6091000	6093000	I keep forgetting the mechanics
6093000	6095000	Of this dumb game
6097000	6099000	Why is it he is allowed to heal
6099000	6101000	And he's allowed to do this
6101000	6103000	And he's allowed to do that
6103000	6105000	Don't you know the video game rules
6105000	6107000	Only I'm supposed to be able to do
6107000	6109000	All the things that help me win the game
6111000	6113000	I never thought that far ahead
6115000	6117000	I never thought in the first place
6117000	6119000	That should be my sentence I don't think
6119000	6121000	Right what was that 50-50
6121000	6123000	Right at least we can heal first
6127000	6129000	Watch your enemies
6129000	6131000	Hand closed
6133000	6135000	Hordeshell
6135000	6137000	Live round that gives me nothing
6137000	6139000	Thank you don't ever speak to me again
6139000	6141000	What's in the chamber
6141000	6143000	Blank
6143000	6145000	I don't have a polarizer
6145000	6147000	So I can officially shoot myself
6147000	6149000	Bunk
6149000	6151000	Right and then
6151000	6153000	And then what
6155000	6157000	I mean that means all Tsar
6157000	6159000	It's a double
6159000	6161000	Cuff him
6161000	6163000	Okay and then what
6163000	6165000	And then
6165000	6167000	The best I can do is just guess
6167000	6169000	I'll say it from this one
6171000	6173000	So is this the third
6173000	6175000	Wow
6175000	6177000	This is why I don't gamble
6177000	6179000	I have no interest in gambling
6179000	6181000	I have no interest in playing Genshin Impact
6181000	6183000	Because it's a Gamba game
6183000	6185000	Or something like that
6185000	6187000	I actually don't know if Genshin Impact
6187000	6189000	Is a Gamba game but
6189000	6191000	Yeah
6191000	6193000	Remaining ammo
6193000	6195000	The fact you're trying to help me
6195000	6197000	And it doesn't help because I'm so dumb
6197000	6199000	It doesn't help
6199000	6201000	I'm too dumb to be helped
6201000	6203000	You guys are just going to have to send in
6203000	6205000	Your gameplay and I'll commentate over
6205000	6207000	And pretend that I'm playing
6207000	6209000	That seems like a plan
6209000	6211000	Surely
6217000	6219000	I'm not, I'm losing it
6219000	6221000	New round
6221000	6223000	Let's see what we've got
6223000	6225000	Let's see what we're working with
6225000	6227000	Two lives, three blanks
6227000	6229000	Okay, okay, okay
6229000	6231000	Oh yeah
6235000	6237000	A burner
6237000	6239000	Just show me if it's good or bad
6241000	6243000	It's good
6243000	6245000	I don't have a polariser though
6245000	6247000	Clink
6247000	6249000	And there's four in the chamber left
6249000	6251000	So let's talk to the phone
6251000	6253000	Because the bass ain't listening
6257000	6259000	Okay
6259000	6261000	That means the odds have increased
6261000	6263000	That this is a live round
6263000	6265000	So we're going to say
6265000	6267000	Funk it
6267000	6269000	And we start
6269000	6271000	Blasting
6275000	6277000	Okay, we know next is blank
6277000	6279000	But he doesn't
6279000	6281000	He doesn't have a polariser
6281000	6283000	Either
6283000	6285000	Hold on
6285000	6287000	Oh
6287000	6289000	Good or bad
6293000	6295000	We know this is blank
6295000	6297000	But we know that this is live
6297000	6299000	And now he knows it's live
6299000	6301000	And he's got a double
6301000	6303000	It's ogre
6303000	6305000	It's ogre
6305000	6307000	And he's cuffing me
6307000	6309000	Bro
6309000	6311000	Wait what
6311000	6313000	Now it's live
6315000	6317000	Oh my goodness
6317000	6319000	Golly
6319000	6321000	If you are like me in small brain
6321000	6323000	This game ain't for you
6323000	6325000	I've got one more in the tank
6325000	6327000	Because she's actually getting ready to go live
6327000	6329000	We've got one more
6329000	6331000	Come on
6331000	6333000	That's it, you know what
6333000	6335000	I'm getting a piece of paper out for this
6335000	6337000	I'm writing down
6337000	6339000	This freaking piece of paper
6339000	6341000	Writing on in this game
6341000	6343000	I'm going to call in
6343000	6345000	This freaking
6345000	6347000	I'm going to call in the big guns
6347000	6349000	Which is me writing on a piece of paper
6349000	6351000	To write down the odds
6351000	6353000	To write down what there is
6353000	6355000	To write down what to do
6355000	6357000	If we do not win this one
6357000	6359000	This settles it
6359000	6361000	That you guys are just far too smart for me
6361000	6363000	And you have picked the most
6363000	6365000	Our worded oh she
6365000	6367000	There possibly could be
6367000	6369000	Right
6369000	6371000	Pull out items
6371000	6373000	Magnifying glass
6373000	6375000	Health
6375000	6377000	No don't want meds
6377000	6379000	I'm not taking my meds you can't convince me
6379000	6381000	Right
6381000	6383000	What's in the chamber
6383000	6385000	Two live
6385000	6387000	Three blank
6387000	6389000	And then I'm going to do it
6389000	6391000	Like hangman on my piece of paper
6393000	6395000	So the odds are already
6395000	6397000	Not
6397000	6399000	The best
6399000	6401000	I am going
6401000	6403000	To
6403000	6405000	Seal his phone
6409000	6411000	I'm going to steal his phone
6411000	6413000	No
6413000	6415000	Yes
6417000	6419000	Yes I'm going to steal his phone
6419000	6421000	To get the intel
6421000	6423000	Fifth shelf blank
6423000	6425000	Okay so for hangman
6425000	6427000	There's now a B on the fifth
6427000	6429000	One
6429000	6431000	For blank
6431000	6433000	We are going to see what's inside
6433000	6435000	Because either way we're doing damage to this round
6435000	6437000	It's a blank so we're going to apply the polarizing effect
6437000	6439000	We're going to put B on the first
6439000	6441000	Hangman section as well
6443000	6445000	So we're polarizing to make it hurt
6445000	6447000	The dealer
6447000	6449000	Is being shot with the polarizing effect
6449000	6451000	Resulting new damage dealt to the dealer
6451000	6453000	Okay
6453000	6455000	Okay
6455000	6457000	So first one's blank
6457000	6459000	Last one's blank we now know this
6459000	6461000	That's perfectly fine
6461000	6463000	All it took was writing it down on a piece of paper
6463000	6465000	And playing hangman
6465000	6467000	I do not fully understand this game
6467000	6469000	Neither am I that's why we're playing hangman
6469000	6471000	He is now inspecting
6471000	6473000	He claims
6473000	6475000	The contents are very interesting
6475000	6477000	He shoots me
6477000	6479000	With a live round
6479000	6481000	The second position is live
6483000	6485000	We are now on a 50-50
6485000	6487000	On the contents of the gun being live
6487000	6489000	Or blank, we cannot ascertain
6489000	6491000	We can heal up
6491000	6493000	But we cannot ascertain what is inside
6493000	6495000	This truly is a 50-50
6497000	6499000	He drank a beer
6499000	6501000	What did I miss it? Two and three were live
6501000	6503000	So we know it's a blank
6503000	6505000	Wait
6505000	6507000	But none of us have a polarizer
6509000	6511000	So this round can be complete
6511000	6513000	So we need to start a new freaking round
6513000	6515000	In hangman game
6515000	6517000	Goodness gravy
6517000	6519000	All blanks
6519000	6521000	Okay
6521000	6523000	A BBL
6523000	6525000	No I didn't get a BBL but thanks for asking baby
6525000	6527000	Right
6527000	6529000	Let's play hangman over again
6529000	6531000	Let me, what is the ratio
6531000	6533000	Three live four blank
6533000	6535000	Three live
6535000	6537000	Four blank
6537000	6539000	Full of seven on hangman
6539000	6541000	One, two, three, four, five
6541000	6543000	Seven, I have adrenaline
6543000	6545000	To call in
6545000	6547000	For information
6547000	6549000	Which we're gonna do
6553000	6555000	Right
6555000	6557000	You can yoink the yoink
6557000	6559000	Right, position second shell
6559000	6561000	Blank, hangman
6561000	6563000	Second is B blank
6563000	6565000	Oh sugar I just dropped my pencil
6567000	6569000	If we handcuff
6569000	6571000	And we are going to act like
6571000	6573000	The first one is live
6573000	6575000	Okay
6575000	6577000	We are going to treat it as live
6577000	6579000	We do not know and we cannot ascertain
6579000	6581000	If that information is true or not
6581000	6583000	However we can shoot ourselves for
6583000	6585000	Okay that was a blank
6585000	6587000	We know the second is a blank
6587000	6589000	So first two are filled out Bs
6589000	6591000	That leaves two blank and three
6591000	6593000	Live on the board
6593000	6595000	We are going to shoot ourselves to give ourselves another round
6597000	6599000	Sadly
6599000	6601000	There are now
6601000	6603000	Five pieces
6603000	6605000	Remaining
6605000	6607000	And we cannot ascertain the knowledge
6607000	6609000	So we're going to treat it as alive
6609000	6611000	This truly is a 50-50
6611000	6613000	We're gonna treat it as alive cause the odds are it's alive
6613000	6615000	You know what I'm just gonna go fuck myself then
6615000	6617000	You know what
6617000	6619000	Because that's the thing with odds
6619000	6621000	That is the thing with odds
6621000	6623000	That is the thing with odds
6623000	6625000	Yeah
6625000	6627000	Yeah it could literally
6627000	6629000	You can flip a coin ten times in a row
6629000	6631000	And statistically never get heads
6631000	6633000	Ten times in a row
6633000	6635000	But that's the thing with odds they are not reality
6635000	6637000	Yeah yeah
6637000	6639000	Yeah yeah
6639000	6641000	Yeah
6641000	6643000	Yeah yeah
6643000	6645000	That's right another
6645000	6647000	Sorry I'm addicted
6647000	6649000	I'm addicted I like this approach sorry
6649000	6651000	The hangman approach is quite fun
6651000	6653000	I'm addicted I can't stop right
6653000	6655000	We've got ten minutes to speak on this
6655000	6657000	Come on
6657000	6659000	Ten minutes
6661000	6663000	Oh my god come on
6663000	6665000	Please sign the waiver I will
6665000	6667000	Anything for you dealer let me do it again
6667000	6669000	Again again again again
6669000	6671000	Ah
6671000	6673000	Okay
6673000	6675000	Let's do it
6675000	6677000	Let's do it
6677000	6679000	Uh
6679000	6681000	Right
6681000	6683000	Let's go
6683000	6685000	Who goes there
6685000	6687000	Identify yourself
6687000	6689000	Three live
6689000	6691000	Four blank
6691000	6693000	Three live
6693000	6695000	Four blank
6695000	6697000	Seven hangman
6697000	6699000	Okay
6699000	6701000	We have adrenaline
6705000	6707000	We are going to get
6707000	6709000	Intel from this adrenaline
6709000	6711000	I assume we can only use adrenaline
6711000	6713000	Once again right the intel is
6715000	6717000	The intel is
6717000	6719000	Third shell live route
6719000	6721000	Okay
6721000	6723000	Can we do double adrenaline
6725000	6727000	Hello
6727000	6729000	Double adrenaline
6729000	6731000	That's cheating
6735000	6737000	Blind shit
6737000	6739000	Oh we have a polarizer
6739000	6741000	Okay that's perfect
6741000	6743000	If we hand cuff
6743000	6745000	Or does that leave
6745000	6747000	That's two live on the board we don't know
6747000	6749000	About three live on the board we don't know
6751000	6753000	Tell you what we could do
6753000	6755000	Hand cuff
6759000	6761000	Polarize
6761000	6763000	Shit
6767000	6769000	Discard
6769000	6771000	The current unknown
6773000	6775000	Because we don't know what it is
6777000	6779000	And I don't trust it
6779000	6781000	So we're just gonna discard it
6781000	6783000	Okay we're just gonna discard it
6783000	6785000	It doesn't really matter
6785000	6787000	Okay so we can write down blank in second
6787000	6789000	So now there's two blank and two live
6789000	6791000	The odds are straight back to 50-50 again
6791000	6793000	We are going to shoot
6797000	6799000	Okay okay so now there's one blank
6799000	6801000	Remaining and two live on the board
6805000	6807000	He's gonna eject a blank
6807000	6809000	So all remaining are now live
6809000	6811000	Shit
6811000	6813000	And he's gonna do
6813000	6815000	He's gonna do three health damage in the sequence
6815000	6817000	Wait
6817000	6819000	Yeah no
6819000	6821000	Sorry sorry sorry
6821000	6823000	Then blank was the fifth there and then it's two live
6823000	6825000	Remaining now
6825000	6827000	Sorry my apologies
6827000	6829000	Two live remaining
6829000	6831000	Unfortunately he will get a lick
6831000	6833000	In on us but that's fine
6833000	6835000	That's fine
6835000	6837000	Do you feel so big brain now
6837000	6839000	No I'm cheating by playing hangman and writing it down
6839000	6841000	That's how hard this game is for me to conceptualize it
6841000	6843000	In my head
6843000	6845000	I cannot do this in an
6845000	6847000	Abstract
6847000	6849000	Concept
6849000	6851000	I don't have the ability to do this
6851000	6853000	I have to write everything down
6853000	6855000	We've got insight
6855000	6857000	We've got two insights
6857000	6859000	Fantastic
6865000	6867000	I'm not gonna do it for this round
6869000	6871000	He's got a polarizer
6871000	6873000	No he doesn't
6873000	6875000	I might as well shoot then
6875000	6877000	Shouldn't I
6877000	6879000	There's no point in using this stuff
6879000	6881000	It's a 50-50 I might as well just shoot
6881000	6883000	There's no point
6883000	6885000	I've got two phones
6885000	6887000	One for the veiler
6887000	6889000	No use the phone
6889000	6891000	No get info
6891000	6893000	But wait wait wait hold on
6893000	6895000	Hold on
6895000	6897000	What's the point in me using the phone
6897000	6899000	Right now because it's 50-50
6899000	6901000	If it's a blank
6901000	6903000	Oh wait
6903000	6905000	Yeah idiot
6905000	6907000	If it's a blank then he can't get a lick in on me
6907000	6909000	Sorry
6909000	6911000	I'm so slow
6911000	6913000	It takes me a moment to remember
6913000	6915000	The way this game plays
6915000	6917000	I'm so sorry
6923000	6925000	We are on to the second round
6931000	6933000	Okay
6933000	6935000	Okay okay okay big brain time
6935000	6937000	Big brain time
6937000	6939000	Winkles
6939000	6941000	Becoming more wrinkly in your brain
6941000	6943000	Your smooth piece of chicken breast
6943000	6945000	Brain is no magnifying
6945000	6947000	Three live three blank
6947000	6949000	Three live three blank
6949000	6951000	Hangman of six
6953000	6955000	Okay
6955000	6957000	Insider knowledge
6957000	6959000	Yes please
6959000	6961000	Third shell
6961000	6963000	Blank
6963000	6965000	Okay
6965000	6967000	Yonkers
6967000	6969000	I would like insider knowledge
6969000	6971000	From the adrenaline burst
6973000	6975000	Okay
6975000	6977000	What are you gonna tell me
6977000	6979000	Fourth shell
6979000	6981000	Blank
6981000	6983000	Okay
6983000	6985000	Now that leaves one blank
6985000	6987000	Unknown
6987000	6989000	The odds
6989000	6991000	Is now one in four
6991000	6993000	Of the current shell
6993000	6995000	Chamber being a blank
6995000	6997000	I think I want to shoot
6997000	6999000	So anyway
6999000	7001000	I start blasting
7001000	7003000	The odds of one in four
7003000	7005000	Yeah okay that's what I like to see
7005000	7007000	Live one in four
7009000	7011000	We are going
7011000	7013000	Okay he's gonna heal up that's perfectly fine
7013000	7015000	He is gonna be able to see what's inside
7015000	7017000	And he does have a polarizer
7017000	7019000	So I'm gonna have to be cautious of that
7019000	7021000	He's gonna check it out
7021000	7023000	What do you see
7023000	7025000	Very interesting
7025000	7027000	Okay
7027000	7029000	Oh he's shooting it's alive
7029000	7031000	Okay
7031000	7033000	So the next two we know are blank
7035000	7037000	So we can blank it up to high heavens
7037000	7039000	Okay
7039000	7041000	Blank
7041000	7043000	Bonk
7043000	7045000	And then blank again
7045000	7047000	Thanks to our insider knowledge
7047000	7049000	And it worked
7049000	7051000	And blank again
7051000	7053000	Then we are going to drink the beer
7053000	7055000	To inject the second last bullet
7055000	7057000	Because we will be able to
7057000	7059000	If this is blank
7059000	7061000	Or if it's live so that was live
7063000	7065000	So that means the remaining one is blank
7065000	7067000	So we can just shoot ourselves
7071000	7073000	Bonk okay all good
7073000	7075000	All good in the hood right new round
7077000	7079000	We do
7079000	7081000	Insider
7081000	7083000	The game knows we are playing hangman
7083000	7085000	The game knows what we got
7085000	7087000	Four live four blank
7087000	7089000	Four live
7089000	7091000	Four blank
7091000	7093000	Hangman one two three
7093000	7095000	Okay I don't have enough room on the paper
7095000	7097000	One two three four five six
7097000	7099000	Seven eight sorry I need to re-write that
7099000	7101000	Because I put it at really awkward bits
7103000	7105000	Right
7105000	7107000	Let me know what's the update
7107000	7109000	Let us know what's going on here
7111000	7113000	Third shell live
7113000	7115000	Perfect
7115000	7117000	Let me know what else is going down
7125000	7127000	Obliet
7127000	7129000	I didn't realise he could do that
7129000	7131000	Yeah
7133000	7135000	I didn't know he could do that
7135000	7137000	Like thanks
7137000	7139000	Right I'm going to
7139000	7141000	Against my better judgement
7141000	7143000	I'm still going to take this
7143000	7145000	Because it's so much better and more valuable
7145000	7147000	To know what's coming up
7147000	7149000	Fifth shell live
7149000	7151000	Okay okay okay
7151000	7153000	We only don't know where two are
7153000	7155000	That leaves me to believe
7155000	7157000	So the odds are now
7157000	7159000	What
7159000	7161000	One in three that this is blank
7163000	7165000	No that's not correct
7169000	7171000	I want to shoot myself
7175000	7177000	Against my better judgement
7177000	7179000	I'm going to claim this as a blank
7179000	7181000	Because statistically it should be
7181000	7183000	Okay
7183000	7185000	We did it
7185000	7187000	Okay we have a second round now
7189000	7191000	There are
7191000	7193000	Three blank
7193000	7195000	What does this mean
7197000	7199000	Cigarettes I can't heal up
7199000	7201000	I don't think
7201000	7203000	In Minecraft
7203000	7205000	In Minecraft
7205000	7207000	Unknown second live
7207000	7209000	I don't know
7209000	7211000	Shoot or not
7211000	7213000	Your max is HP 4
7213000	7215000	Let's have a wee quick
7215000	7217000	We'll start mull over this
7217000	7219000	Thank you
7219000	7221000	My apologies
7221000	7223000	I thought this was like you couldn't heal it
7223000	7225000	A 4 4 4
7225000	7227000	Should we get a cigarette
7227000	7229000	Smoker and gen 2
7229000	7231000	Apparently that's a really big kink
7231000	7233000	That I didn't know about
7233000	7235000	A wham and smokes a ciggy
7235000	7237000	No
7237000	7239000	I don't know what it's going to be
7241000	7243000	You know what
7243000	7245000	If I shoot myself
7245000	7247000	It's actually going to not be that bad
7249000	7251000	Okay we know this one is live
7251000	7253000	So we can shoot
7253000	7255000	A double shot
7257000	7259000	I get so excited to like
7259000	7261000	Utilize
7261000	7263000	We would have gone on to the next round
7263000	7265000	Oh we would have gone on to the next round
7265000	7267000	If I wasn't so
7267000	7269000	Freakin quick shorty
7269000	7271000	Okay
7271000	7273000	He just ejected alive
7273000	7275000	So it's live live live actually
7275000	7277000	Wait what
7277000	7279000	Oh
7279000	7281000	Thanks for letting me go to the other round
7281000	7283000	Even though I messed up I appreciate you dealer
7283000	7285000	The game must know
7285000	7287000	I'm like sweating so hard
7287000	7289000	We finally made it
7289000	7291000	To round 3
7291000	7293000	Okay
7293000	7295000	Okay
7295000	7297000	Hangman ain't got nothing on us
7297000	7299000	Okay
7299000	7301000	Medicine
7301000	7303000	Polarize
7303000	7305000	That's fine
7305000	7307000	2 live 2 blank
7307000	7309000	2 live
7309000	7311000	3 blank sorry
7311000	7313000	Sorry number
7317000	7319000	We have no insider information
7319000	7321000	We have odds which is blank
7321000	7323000	The odds
7323000	7325000	Stepulate this is a blank
7325000	7327000	So I shouldn't theory put the polarizing
7327000	7329000	On and shoot myself
7331000	7333000	We have to go with odds
7333000	7335000	We have no choice shoot the dealer with polarizer
7335000	7337000	On
7339000	7341000	So that was a blank
7341000	7343000	So now it's 2 to 50 50
7343000	7345000	Perfect and he can see what's inside

7363000	7365000	Wow
7365000	7367000	If I take the medicine I expire
7367000	7369000	Because my odds are not good enough
7373000	7375000	This is it
7375000	7377000	I either win this game mode
7377000	7379000	Or get it on whatever we pick
7379000	7381000	Now the odds are
7381000	7383000	This is blank
7385000	7387000	Swallow the medicine
7387000	7389000	I'll swallow it
7389000	7391000	Because you asked me to
7391000	7393000	Refling
7397000	7399000	Ah!
7399000	7401000	Refling
7401000	7403000	Ah!
7403000	7405000	Forever tame because she be live with celebration
7407000	7409000	It was worth it though
7409000	7411000	I died doing what I love the most
7411000	7413000	Guzzling refling's ink
7415000	7417000	I perished doing what I love the most
7417000	7419000	Okay
7419000	7421000	So I don't feel that bad
7421000	7423000	That was so good
7423000	7425000	That was fantastic
7425000	7427000	I can 100% see us revisit in this game
7427000	7429000	In a membership stream
7429000	7431000	I don't like replaying games that I may have already done before
7431000	7433000	But thank you
7433000	7435000	So so much for that
7435000	7437000	Fantastic experience on this game

7453000	7455000	Visual design is absolutely
7455000	7457000	Beautiful

7459000	7461000	The poly
