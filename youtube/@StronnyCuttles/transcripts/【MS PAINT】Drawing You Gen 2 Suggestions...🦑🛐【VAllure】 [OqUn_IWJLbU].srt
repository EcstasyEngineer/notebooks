45
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,640
her childhood at the start of streaming that's it make her look like she eats an i-hop six pack

49
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,800
no clue why you think this would be azura at all like it it's actually kind of i don't know i feel

50
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:08,840
like you're being stereotypical here what are you talking about ruthlyn see it's not azura at all

55
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,480

56
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,480

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,680
like okay i'm gonna sip my tea but good morning hope you guys are having fun i've tried to upload

58
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,960
all of my streams for this week youtube is having a hissy fit so they're all at the wrong time and

59
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,200
stuff but i have picked my um little i have picked what i'm gonna do this week how long does it take

60
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,360
to draw well considering i have absolutely no um hours behind drawing i don't know how long this

61
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,920
is gonna take i have no idea what i'm doing i'm just here for a good time but i've got goth eye hop

62
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:48,200
right here right what have you decided pick draw pick draw pick draw all right okay you guys have

63
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,560
decided guys have decided right let me slurp my tea okay so the first things first you need to pick

64
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:03,720
the three colors that go behind the design okay so you guys have said goth eye hop is eye hop's

65
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,760
logo red yeah is eye hop's logo red my brain wants to say it's red yes or no be be honest

66
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,240
good afternoon hope your day's going great my day hasn't even ended yet i have not slept

67
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,520
there's a new development behind the scenes and i can't even leak it i of course the eye hop is

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,200
it's like blue and white it's blue and white a blue and white goth so blue

69
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,240
white and black for the goth okay so this is our little color palette that we get to pull from

70
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,760
it's blue with red accents okay and then obviously because it's goth we have to do black

71
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:54,440
so this is our color scheme developed now for a cheeky goth um okay there's a little red uh

72
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,240
maybe maybe i'll do a red god i'm returning into france over here steady on

73
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:10,280
okay so for our totally not she be design um for our pupil let's start with the pupil

74
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:19,480
she is a goth goths are known for how dark they are what's a dark pupil that we could make i have

75
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,440
no idea so first let's do the pupil that's the most important part of a veal or design because

76
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,920
we do not have like a default pupil oh god that's so squiggly let's give her eyelashes oh you're

77
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:42,040
so kawaii ooh lovely oh my god you're such a beautiful girl uh an american god did you at least

78
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,680
get a good nap no i got like 30 minutes why no slime girls i think we're probably going to be

79
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,840
designing a slime girl i think we're probably going to be designing a slime girl red red white

80
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:05,240
and blue goths are known for their love of kenny from south park vampire bat shape i think a goth

81
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:16,840
would be cross an upside down cross maybe now your pupils really cannot be black well actually

82
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,640
no that's exactly what color the pupils are they are normally black but for a vtuber it's not like

83
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,200
how you're supposed to do it oh strani what do you know about development fuck all i don't draw i just

84
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,520
like you just can what looks good so we're just gonna do a darker hue on the outer side of her

85
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:44,360
eyes like that and then for the cross should we do it black i mean we could get away with it being

86
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,840
black a little upside down cross like this for the oh that's that looks like a plus sign try again

87
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,520
he won't strong it there we go upside down cross for the pupils and then it would have like the

88
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:07,320
accent of um oh maybe no that looks too silly okay it would just have like a little white

89
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,400
highlight around it i'm covering up the black note you know what i'm trying to do right you guys can

90
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,760
do this right yes for the slime girl you have to pick what body type you can have milk you can

91
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,840
have regular or you can have a lollipop on the slime but you guys can we'll do that after we've

92
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:32,840
designed our little une san okay so we've got our pupil type already fantastic um if she is her big

93
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:42,120
sister i don't normally see um how the fuck do i zoom in oh hold on hold on i'll pause this

94
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,160
stuff there we go boom zoom in like this um oh that looks even worse zoomed in who thought of

95
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,720
this stream i mean it was me but it's even worse than i imagined okay so now we need to transplant

96
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,520
her eyes on right so when it comes to anime the eyes are like down here okay so don't be

97
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:12,360
fooled the eyes need to start like all the way down here it looks weird right okay why did it wiggle

98
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,800
don't wiggle please don't wiggle no right don't do it that way don't do the actual circle so this

99
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:27,640
is une san is she a smoker if she's a goth she would smoke right we'll do a little ciggy hanging

100
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,560
out of her mouth at least cigarette cigarette was it is it brown at the bottom yeah brown at the

101
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,160
bottom where the filter is and then she's got like a little a little smoke thing you want red lipstick

102
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,960
oh i guess for the accent yeah oh maybe she has like she always has like little kissed cigarettes

103
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:55,720
around her this looks awful now you see why i literally do not design these girls

104
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,600
this is awful okay so that's sorry i'm completely like messing this up as well

105
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,680
you never saw a cigarette before i don't i have seen them but i don't smoke so it makes it harder

106
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,480
to imagine what i'm supposed to do at this stage okay then upside down cross oh my god she's gonna

107
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,120
look like a muppet do i look like a muppet to you i mean a little bit oh god i need to zoom in even

108
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,320
more oh my god this is like i don't want to zoom i'm getting scared to zoom in it looks scarier

109
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,880
she's oh she's looking like a clown you know that oh this is

110
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,840
are you squinting me right now oh his idea was this black lipstick also requesting to redest

111
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,440
her and ender on the dare types fandom wiki really wish we could have both at the same time or if

112
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,360
she could alternate between the two so you want her to have multiple personality disorder coming

113
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,880
right up i'm sure i can find a feature over that no problem okay we're gonna give her a little wee

114
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:08,120
white eyeliner thing okay and then for the hair now if you are emo real one of being emo or anything

115
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:16,040
you you require bangs of some kind it doesn't matter what they are you require bangs of some kind

116
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:23,560
so we have four points to her eyes so i'm going to give her so i've got three bangs like if you if

117
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,080
you count above my eyeballs there's three oh thank you for this strong if you want to find the person

118
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,760
who keeps making you do all these bad ideas just look in the mirror tell us how the fight went

119
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,800
afterwards oh my god that's just thank you thank you raven for the tip again and then thank you tiny

120
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,600
spiny for insulting me to my face rude you know i'll actually say one thing i submitted for

121
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,840
something like this i didn't get it back but i submitted so she needs four say that's three that

122
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:04,120
i'm just drawing myself god damn it wait hold on four how'd i get four that's five what but that's

123
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:13,080

124
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,200
minute i can't can't right she would have bangs no it can't go over her eyes because that's like

125
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:29,480
real number one of each of her so one bang two three four god i am special okay well right if she's

126
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,880
emo i hop so she would serve so she would have a cap on right like one of them those caps how do

127
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:46,040
you draw a cap i don't know i don't know how to draw a cap okay we take off her top of their head

128
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,520
i'm so sorry bowl haircut no hold on let it develop right so she'd be wearing a cap right

129
00:15:52,520 --> 00:16:01,560
those like those hats that like come like this right and it would say i hop but because it's

130
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:12,680
your inappropriate onesans she was i hop on yo don't worry the algorithm can't read that okay and

131
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:20,840
then for the back of her hair what would we do some kind of i don't know let's get rid of the

132
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,320
cigarette smoke mr. cigarette you're in her way i will remove you at once thank you okay but for

133
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,720
her hair if she's got she needs like intricate like multiple things like coming out but what maybe

134
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:41,640
first do like the little no tell you what tell you what no hold on this went from chat giving strong

135
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,120
ideas to roasting the process give her twin tails but i'm biased towards twin tails i love i love

136
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:56,280
symmetrical hair like that i'm gonna make her asymmetrical on purpose okay so one side is gonna

137
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,920
be a bunch that come oh my god this is awful that comes out right and it's super duper long

138
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:12,360
because she's so edgy like that yeah she's just such an edgy onesan okay and then it's gonna be black

139
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,560
i'm so sorry she'd be here it's gonna be black but she's gonna have like the classic like oh this is

140
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,640
an asian in a in a video game let's give her a random purple streak and then for her bangs

141
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:40,200
she's gonna have purple blue on the outside only yeah yeah okay but then on the other side this is

142
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,080
the hideous most disgusting ugliest character design i've ever seen okay so one side is that

143
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,440
and then the other side oh no please see jim leader sabrina from pokemon find inspiration

144
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,960
jam leader sabrina okay i'm unironically looking the operate now i don't know how to do here

146
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,560

147
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:25,240

149
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,800

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:42,120
how do you come out how do you envision what the freaking process is well hang it on the fridge

151
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,840

156
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,040

185
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,960
me to have a slime girl i am not debuffing someone so harshly okay it is paramount that

186
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:59,240
her left eyebrow has a piercing it must be visually it her right but visually our left okay

187
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:07,480
visually our left but it's her right because she's always right we kneel for our big sister

188
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,760

190
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:35,400
what about four cans of Pringles anonymous stop it young man so the price is how much no there's

191
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,440
no i i'm not giving someone a slime girl debuff at least if i like someone wants an alternative

192
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,640
sure but i'm not giving someone a slime debuff the the gimmick of a slime disappears after about

193
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,040
20 seconds okay i don't care what you say we're about to draw a slime girl together and i'm going

194
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:02,280
to prove to you that the debuff is like so quick right i want it to be like really like this is

195
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,840
this button is ready to pop i don't know if you guys have seen sin sister's very unique toggle

196
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:18,040
but this shirt is ready to pop okay do i make myself clear okay and then we just need to connect

197
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:28,840
the shirt because that's how shirts work okay beautiful stunning now now what okay pan i mean

198
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:37,320
it's really rare for v-tubers to have a shorts in general so honestly i am down for shorts like

199
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:46,520
emmy has we shorts i don't know i actually wouldn't mind the kind of like covered up thingy and then

200
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,000
we do the fishnets what's that i'm going to manually draw fishnets oh you bet your you

201
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,040
bet your ass i am that's right because we're using ms paint that if you think this stream is painful

202
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:08,440
now you just wait until we start drawing the slime girl i am drawing directly on top of these bases

203
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:17,000
and there's nothing you can do about it manually pop that like behind me hi mommy sorry i'm late

204
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
ah i don't be silly not late right oh wait hold on no we're doing full body fishnets like i um sorry

205
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,320
we're doing full bottom fishnets so the fishnets are viewable up here above her thing hold on let me

206
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,760
just let me just swing my cock around because the fishnets would go above the shorts as well

207
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:50,040
just to really solidify that she's emo and it's not it's not it's not a phase mom okay

208
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,320
and then we do it this way and just like that we have created new fishnets

209
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,880
what's that this is the cringiest design you've ever seen and it's the most basic one yeah what

210
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,280
you're gonna do for it yeah you're gonna love it aren't you and then when gen two does actually get

211
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,320
revealed you guys are gonna laugh even harder looking at these because i already know what gen

212
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:28,440
two look like and you do not there we go and then if you didn't know at the end of a taste there's

213
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,640
like a woman is racist you she hates slime girls oh i didn't know where you were going with that and

214
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:45,080
i was like excuse me refling i thought you were actually calling i was like excuse me right okay

215
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:53,000
it's fine thank you for the tip anonymous i'm drawing i'm drawing a slime okay you you have

216
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,760
bullied me into submission i am drawing a slime after this one so the slime accusations can disappear

217
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:10,520
okay and then no one can call me slay mist again okay i believe in non osmosis supremacy okay if

218
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,960
you didn't know osmosis is a high concentration gradient to a low low concentration gradient

219
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,520
high concentration there concentration i can't remember what was mean yours okay and then we

220
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,320
did a little tool thing there's a little tool thing at the end of the fishnet

221
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:35,080
okay fishnets are almost done we're almost there

222
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,840
um we need to do the buttons on the shorts i love when the shorts have the buttons

223
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,480
i know she sits on her shorts funny because that button hits her button real good

224
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,520
stop it it's like first thing in the morning i have not slept so i'm extra delirious honestly

225
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,480
right i love when the shorts do that thing where it's like this and then it has a button here and

226
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,960
then it goes along and then like that oh well i guess that's the top of the shorts

227
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,920
no okay are you squiddin me right now are you squiddin me right now suggestions black thong strings

228
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:22,680
on her hips fishnet cell book gloves black handcuffs and ankle restraints black lipstick

229
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:29,320
one tiny black heart under just one eye black heart shaped pupils no i'm sticking with my

230
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:38,120
shitty pupils i've already decided right i'll take the heart piercing heart it's very clear

231
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,360
that she's also pierced in a few other regions for no particular reason i'm just making sure i've

232
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:51,800
got the shirt detail correct yep um how the fuck are belly piercings how do belly buttons

233
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,840
piercings work i actually don't know like is that a line no it's not a line it goes in the skin

234
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,440
okay she's also pierced in another region because you know she kind of freaky like that but uh you

235
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:13,480
can't get a toe piercing so that doesn't count um i actually controversially like the short

236
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,600
fishnet gloves i think because of the contrast that would play with the long leg fishnets

237
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,360
and then the glove very it's very short glove variation almost as if she's

238
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:35,080
like willing to touch you and you crave what you can get through the fishnet because if it was like

239
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:43,480
full length it's like oh the touch isn't as you know deep but it's deep uh i think maybe we'll

240
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,840
give her long black nails as well like classic long black nails i think that would do quite well

241
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,560
because like i mean come on be honest oh look at that come on don't you oh wait no hold on we'll

242
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:04,040
make her nails the same colors her eyeballs oh my god this is we're doing it i love piercings

243
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:11,720
because they taste like coins and i'm all about the money why why that's hilarious okay but she has

244
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,680
like longer fingernails like coffin shape if any of you guys know what coffin shape nails are you're

245
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:24,360
a real one she got oh who i keep disappearing off to someone else what do you mean drawing on ms

246
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,200
paint isn't a valid way to create an entire feature remote what are you talking about honestly right

247
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:40,680
for the the shorts there's not really much detail to it beyond what meets the eye should they be

248
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:47,640
short or um maybe they should be shorter in the fishnet raised up

249
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:55,160
uh okay okay i think they should be raised up let's raise them up

250
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,400
what what do you mean i'm delirious because i've not had enough sleep i have no idea what you're

251
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:20,120
talking about you are crazy whoa that's not how to erase something i guess we have to color in her

252
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:28,200
legs honestly i mean i'll take it it's fine i was gonna suggest that but i don't know coffin nails

253
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:38,360
are the best oh yeah we shadow wizard money game we love coffin okay our little and then

254
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:47,880
and then her model oh my god then her catchphrase is gonna be um her catchphrase if i can get it out

255
00:31:47,880 --> 00:32:01,880
is gonna be why does it her catchphrase is gonna be let me serve you okay but obviously it's like

256
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,760
the winky face kind like excellent excellent let me serve you yeah like that kind of thing

257
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:16,760
what country do you come from a country called scotland forever okay this is the

258
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,560
shitest design ever okay well there she is so oh god is that really it is that oh i've got to offer

259
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:30,040
this world oh it's awful right her name's hex could you get any more stereotypical

260
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,720
there's nothing to the design i'll take it though i'll i think that's okay i would give this design

261
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:48,200
i would rate it great out of basic did you know ms paint has layers oh does it actually

262
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,080
that probably would have anyway uh i'm just gonna bring her to life because you know wait can i

263
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,520
can i oh i don't know how i did it but i managed to close the gap on the eyeballs okay right

264
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,640
yes i mean that's all we can do

265
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,080
because i don't have anything else to add to her we have done goth i hop employee of the month

white outlines to it um she wears an infinity collar but it's actually secretly your infinity

268
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,680
collar that you gave her and then she says let me serve you winky face xoxo and she has a smoke

271
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,360
her in heels servers don't wear heel heels servers wear trainers because it's too sore

276
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:35,320
secret about the service industry if you are just a waitress and all you have to do is hold the little

277
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:44,760
tree of food and drinks i have fantastic news you can have long nails if however you prepare things

278
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:54,680
as a waitress you cannot have long nails because you're preparing food but if you're only doing

279
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:05,480
the serving and the gathering like that and dempo is a genia can you make a really sexy

282
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:28,200
not between azura strongy or a super body type we'd long here nails mix up no depends if you're

283
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:36,600
using a server tree they could just be press-ons real real and true wrist and ankle cuffs like a

284
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:47,160
bracelet as you can tell i'm not very good at imagining and she's got one shoe because i gave

285
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,520
up halfway through making this shoe azura strongy do a poll oh yes of course we can do a poll don't

286
00:35:52,520 --> 00:36:04,200
be so silly hold on let me do a poll start poll slain is what body type azuras strong wild card

287
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,640
sorry i see let's go leave azura alone we can think of something better you don't want slime

288
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,960
azura

289
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,240

290
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:32,760

291
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,200
oh wow you want a milf slime what the heck i didn't expect that i thought you would want a lollipop

292
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:49,400

294
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:07,080

295
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,840
chubby pig girl oh no i wouldn't put a pig on a big body type that's not nice

296
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,800
slain girl you can drown in i mean i guess uh it looks like azura is still winning so yeah

297
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:31,160
slain girl being thick to drown in her yeah a urethra slice if wait right i'll tell you what

298
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:39,480
if i ever develop a slain girl the first audio i'll make her a record is a slain girl claims

299
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,120
into your urethra and tickles your pickle from the inside out that'll be my deal you asked for

302
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:10,440
and okay what color is the slime is the question

303
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:21,160
no deal promise slain girl digest you she has a deal that sounds very uncomfortable is there a

304
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,200
downside to stop uh you don't have to sell her anymore jokes on you i'm into that

305
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,720
have her climb into me and pilot my meat so i would be down for that i like the main control

306
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:46,280
thing you want a brown slime no okay so here we go uh done okay there's your slime girl right can we

307
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:55,080
move on teasing i'll actually put some effort okay so we've got we've got milf oh hold on the

308
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,640
well milf slime why wait i told it to make the text black oh it doesn't matter

309
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,720
okay first pick the color scheme oh wait hold on that's like gonna be in her hair right milf

310
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,200
slime one two and three we need to pick a color scheme green white a brown slime just sounds like

311
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,680
diarrhea jello okay that's kind of mildly true red would be a unique slime claw

312
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:31,640
base i'm a sucker for blue i mean she you yeah hex was originally supposed to be blue but kind of

313
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:41,400
messed up between what so like blue for one claw of the slime and then the accent color will be like

314
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:50,120
a neon pink i think this is the accent claw have like little hints of it in between maybe

315
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,480
maybe like green as well like just make her like really just off of rgb slightly and make her like

316
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,720
a jelly thing polka dot slime would be cute two tone white green or white purple

317
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,320
okay maybe not green then i don't think you guys are fuss for the green right how about accent

318
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:20,680
white and blue main and then accent is pink okay let's see what we can come up with now so

319
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:34,120
i can do right oh and just just for now imagine so that's the body okay now you can put clothes on

320
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,400
a slime girl it looks terrible i know it looks terrible but you can put clothes on a slime girl

321
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:46,280
see it oh no she's she's she's on hello sherbert's slime

322
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,560
paint bucket artis what can i say i really i do myself now i like when the slime girl

323
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:00,200
is dripping i and because you guys wanted the milk i wouldn't mind some sort of

324
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:07,560
like implications of dripping here oh that's awful that's like nothing like a drip holy crap

325
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:16,760
Oh my god, that's- how the frick do you make a drip? Like dripping from the belly button and stuff. How do you do that?

326
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
Why is this so much harder?

327
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,600
Oh my god.

328
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,040
Haven't you found respect for concept artists? I can't believe it.

329
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:35,040
All that took was one attempt at doing something and then I understand why it's not as- she got that drip rain jacket body

330
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,240
So white droplets. Oh, it probably should actually be white. Very oopsies. Let me just add a little white onto it real quick. Oh

331
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
little

332
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Whiteness in there

333
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
I'm dripping from the belly button

334
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,840
You can't really drip from a toe. So we'll drip from that ankle

335
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,120
Is your drip? You just need to draw sweat honestly. Okay. Now you can draw an outfit

336
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,960
So sue is currently the most popular slime, and I will not be taking any aligunkies that she's not

337
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:20,080
If she's blue like if she's actually blue, I think I might have to give her what yellow jacket like actual rain jacket style

338
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,960
Oh god, she looks like a genie. You know that? Oh my god

339
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,880
I don't think this is working the way I wanted it to. She's like princess leah like add some red in there

340
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,120
And then you've just got princess leah going on

341
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,400
She's blue. How buddy? How would I you want a swimsuit?

342
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,920
I like that. Keep cooking a swimsuit milk

343
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
That I do not mind

344
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,040
Healy is what profile picture. Thank you for coming to member. I appreciate it membership streams start up next week

345
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920

346
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,040
There's going to be ton of membership streams bombed right at the end of this month

347
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,880
Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right. I want a swimsuit. How do you draw a swimsuit? Hold on

348
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,720
I'm going to look up women's wet and

349
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,720
Because I don't know what it looks like because I wear a very funny swimsuit that covers me up completely

350
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Mm-hmm

351
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:30,320
Um, I guess it would honestly just what we'll go for like the classic like the it would be like up here

352
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,120
It oh my god, that's quite a high. It's a hard to be

353
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,960
Oh, sorry, I've got that freaking spot. Well, I her thing went sideways

354
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
And then

355
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I

356
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,120
Can you do hold on a minute. Can you do a swimsuit that looks like this?

357
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,280
Whoa, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me cook. Let me cook. Let me cook. This is awful

358
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Don't let me cook by the way, but can I do a swimsuit

359
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,560
That's held up by straps. I'm just drawing a zero then if it's held up by straps

360
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,040
gosh darn it

361
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,800
Azura get out of my head. Oh, I'm like the kitten

362
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,120
Come here. Okay, so it's like this

363
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,240
Let's get rid of that. He's just getting a bit confused and that's in the way

364
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,760
Uh, and then what uh, what was the slimes name be slime mix slime McGee?

365
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I don't know

366
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,880
She can't have a naked model in each of the slime needs clothes jeweler the fake delete you

367
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:49,440
Uh, she has a skeleton. I don't know. Slimes are like osmosis. I feel like she'd accidentally pick stuff up though

368
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,640
So I wouldn't mind putting some jewelry on her. Fuck it. You can get like a wee anklet thing going on

369
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,280
This is just Azura. God damn. Why is it so hard right? What would be inside a slime?

370
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,600
What a slime would accidentally pick up juice. Whoa, where's my thing?

371
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,880
Right, let's let's put some juice

372
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,480
Slimes love juice. So we're going to give her a can of cola in her thigh. Okay. This is cola

373
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,360
There we go, so she actually got cola in her

374
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,240
Um

375
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,000
White button down dress through she be office. Maybe there is no she be. This is gen two. We've got hex

376
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,800
We've got milf slime that doesn't even have a name yet. I'm unironically ever just going to call her slime McGee right now

377
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
Slimey

378
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
Slimey

379
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
Slime McGee

380
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,120
Here we go

381
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,600
Beautiful stunning gorgeous for her eyeball. You'll never guess what's going to be in her eyeball

382
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,280
So she's gonna have that and then her eyeball is going to be a droplet. Okay

383
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But the actual

384
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,400
pupil hold on let me let me close this off so I can do the old copy and paste method

385
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
A chris diet

386
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,120
Diet cook, diet cook. Don't let strongy pick names again. Still I'm so sad that I'm not allowed to name after admit

387
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,840
The names up and picked her way better than anything I could have come up with. Oh, hey

388
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Um, right drop

389
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,680
A little droplet like would be her pupil and it like wiggles around

390
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,880
And then we're gonna do that boom just like that

391
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,240
And then obviously we'll just add like a bit of weight to do the

392
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,960
Um, like highly saying that I anime eyes always have

393
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,280
So now we will draw on the slimes. Oh, you have lovely anime at big anime eyes gorgeous stunning, right do the half

394
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,560
Whoa

395
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,800
I made this oh, I actually made it bigger. Okay. Do the half face. It's like down here

396
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:12,240
Okay, do the eye do the eye do the eye do the eye and then she's like looking at you with her gliby eyes

397
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Oh god, she's gonna be alien

398
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
She's got very big eyes

399
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
Very big anime eyes

400
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,240
Anime anime give them an anime

401
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,040
And then we do the accent color which is this

402
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,200
Pink which I've literally not put anywhere else on the design

403
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,800
I don't know who designed her but you've done a terrible job

404
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,840
Because you've not done any of that accent color. Okay

405
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,480
I'm like jewelry, but I'm like Azura has jewelry. I'm just recreating Azura

406
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,000
Pondela Buzum. No

407
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,040
Fondela slime are you slimy curls?

408
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,840
Jelsica

409
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,480
Jelsica

410
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:05,360
Like the silicone gel pot, you know someone said she has a pet fish in there her mascot could be swimming around inside her

411
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,720
Maybe she got like a little fishy in her tummy

412
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,520
And then she then whenever she cancels stream and she's like I've got a sore tummy is because there's a fish in her

413
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,440
Yeah

414
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Come on. That's like so smart

415
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:27,440
There and then she I was so her her shtick is like she cancels streams and she go she go tummy hurt

416
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040
Tummy hurt

417
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Stream cancelled

418
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,360
Stream can't sit a little

419
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Cuz fish

420
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Yeah, there we go

421
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Boom right there a little arrow pointing to the fish come on me

422
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,320
That's beautiful. Of course the first thing I see is my oh

423
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,000
Because everyone would shut the fuck up about a goddamn slime girl

424
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,160
So I give I give him so whenever someone was in the slime girl

425
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,520
I can be like there there she is looking all ugly and shittly designed in the corner

426
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:12,240
At least like hex had something going for her, but slimy slime magie. It just looks awful

427
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,760
Jella pronounced Jella. Why is it got a

428
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,440
Good in front of it then because that's a good. That's a good letter. Okay, you see good

429
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:31,200
Slime girls were it should be a baby shark. Oh should we give her a slime tail while we're at it might as well

430
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,960
Just just fucking farmer out the wazoo there

431
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,640
She's got a big slimy tail and she sucks you in with it and everything gets stuck to there

432
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,240
Can you make her more drippy and wet she's like a round wavetail

433
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,200
What if each item inside is related to the members of the

434
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,560
Wait, am I gonna do that? I am an idiot

435
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,600
But I'm a happy idiot. That's the main thing there

436
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,760
She's got a big ugly tail as well just to really emphasize. She's a slime right now. We need to deal with her freaking hair

437
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,640
Right slimes are always droplet shaped. So what she's got like droplet bangs

438
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,480
No, that's awful. Right. No bangs. You are getting big ugly forehead because I hate you so much

439
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,640
Right. No do what

440
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,920
Right, so the side bangs have to be a tear shape like that. That's that's unavoidable

441
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,480
Oh

442
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Can she have

443
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,720
A droplet ahayio or whatever the it's not ahayio. That's the uh thing

444
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,200
Most of the deeper it comes in the shine of the drops looks more shiny

445
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,280
So you admit it dempa you two understand that I hate sleep

446
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,720
Just adding shine to the skin and the shadows will do a lot

447
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,080
If she has the soccer mom personality, you can call her ghillie

448
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,160
Cuz screaming jello huge drops on the side of her head

449
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,640
Like I

450
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,720
This is oh my god. Just give her a bowl cut. That's how much I hate her. Go away

451
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,040
I don't like you don't ever cook again. Right. What does she have though?

452
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,880
Would you have like a spout hair style? No

453
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,200
A fucking shower head look right and then what her hair would just be long and flowing. I think

454
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:30,480
There's no way it wouldn't be. Oh my god. This is she looks like jar jar bangs. No

455
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,360
This is even worse. How about this? Oh, right just just

456
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,080
Ah

457
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,160
This looks like jar jar fucking bangs misa slime girl misa gonna hug you

458
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,440
Ah, this is awful awful awful

459
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,600
At least hexa has something going for her like seriously look at hexa compared to slimy slime McGee. This is awful

460
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
Hair would be ocean frost

461
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,720
Yeah, it's not just coffee a cat a slime girl from monster misumi

462
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
I like

463
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
I got on dvd

464
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,800
Misa joining the via sucky. No

465
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,280
Right, that'll be our catchphrase and then it's over with I never have to think of a slime girl again

466
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Was it me me?

467
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,520
Join

468
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,760
Did you say misa joiner?

469
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,720
V sucky

470
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,840
That's the catchphrase. Well, that's not catchphrase. I don't give a shit. I do not I couldn't give less of a shite

471
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,960
Hold on. This is a bit too close to the head of the next one

472
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,040
Oh

473
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,280
Her slime covers half of her face hiding the fact that she has a single eye swimming in her head

474
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,560
How does this happen? How do you create jar jar banks by accident? I don't know

475
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,720
Okay, so she's got cola in her thigh absolutely no detail

476
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,720
What's so ever going on other than a cola in the thigh a few droplets a tail that I don't it makes no sense

477
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,080
And for some reason when she's got fish in her stomach. So when she cancels streams

478
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Her tummy hurts because of the fish

479
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,040
Another slime girl. No, you're done. And then she's fucking jar jar banks. Okay

480
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,680
Now that we've got that out of our system

481
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,160
We have

482
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,320
three body types remaining. We've got two lollipops and a regular schmigular joe

483
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,760
Why do you hate them so much? I don't hate them

484
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
I cannot

485
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,960
I cannot in good consciousness give a slime girl

486
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,160
to someone if we were to expand the team at velour

487
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,160
because

488
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,680
It's such

489
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,640
It's the gimmick is funny for five seconds and then no one's laughing

490
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,280
Give her to me all yours all yours, baby take jar jar banks

491
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:29,200
Slime slime McGee me so join a visa key. Shawnee hate manifested and the only creature she hates enough to depict that

492
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,280
Shawnee aren't we missing one? There's not there is no totally not mercy present

493
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,120
We need six girls for Jen. No, no, we just need the five because

494
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,120
So we've got two lollipops a regular to go so what do you need a butterfly girl

495
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
A butterfly girl

496
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,560
I'm indifferent to slimes and v-tubers

497
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,520
The only thing if an indie become slime on their own another and need to cast someone in another role jar jar gips

498
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Oh, that's actually such a good name

499
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,160
jar jar

500
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
get

501
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,760
There's a big niche for it, but it's very specific. I just think they're cute by gay

502
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,760
I say here is my most goofy suggestion that I could think of

503
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:28,080
Claudia scientists that perform ethically questionable research on chat involving electrical devices

504
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,040
lowly white slash green slash

505
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Wait in green

506
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,320
Oh, you didn't see what kind of green be you said I'm mad scientist. So I kind of feel like neon

507
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,360
green

508
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,800
what's

509
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,880
Kuderi, I think I know what kuderi is

510
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,160
But I'm just gonna look up just in case look we're in the information age

511
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,760
You're allowed to look up a Japanese time for a character appears to not have emotions

512
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,240
Oh, she's gonna have very creepy eyes if that's the case

513
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:07,120
Wait, what was it? I think I'll thank you math for the kuderi scientists

514
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,400
A science I'm with the science team

515
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,960
Okay, let's do her eye

516
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,960
if she's a scientist

517
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,720
Oh god, what's that? Oh god science symbols. I don't want the radiation one. I want like the poison one

518
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,400
Mmm, I'm looking online and we could do a proton technically

519
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,040
We could do DNA if she what can if you're saying she does unethical testing

520
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,800
I it's giving DNA and if you didn't know deoxyribonucleic acid

521
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,360
Based off the blue ghost firefly which is smaller than a grain of rice

522
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,880
I'll show you my grain of rice. What does that mean?

523
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,360
You didn't give me any iPhone. I would give the DNA sequence

524
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,280
Um

525
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,800
We could what would her accent color be red?

526
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,160
Like minish style

527
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,080
I turned myself into an animated tube a girl morty

528
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
No, don't don't

529
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,080
Miss morgan four armed firefly lollipop based off of the blue ghost firefly, which is small

530
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,080
A firefly like a red angry thing

531
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,040
I mean, we don't really have red

532
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,160
Maybe possibly plausible. Thank you for

533
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:39,520
Eating it Raven I turn myself into an anime girl. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no, right accent color

534
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,520
Green and purple

535
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,760
Question mark green and purple and white

536
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,080
Yeah, yeah

537
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:00,720
Big lab coat should we do like when the arms go over I like when that when it's a lollipop and the arms like completely go over

538
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,520
I've not

539
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,600
Hmm might hold on hold on if purple is going to be the other color. We're going to connect the

540
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,360
DNA via the lines like that now it would probably be a bit smaller in her eyeball, but I mean, we've got it

541
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,160
We've got it right. Okay

542
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,520
Now ignoring hexa right there. Um

543
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,840
Lab coat that's too big

544
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:36,960
She's 19 bus 10 PhDs because she's so smart honestly, she was setting calculus at nine. What were you doing at nine years old?

545
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,960
That's right playing Beyblades

546
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,040
That's right. Green purple white familiar colors game

547
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,720
Strangling

548
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,760
I'm not purple if you were asking the new purple

549
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,320
Green and purple. Yes. Okay. Uh a lab coat

550
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,840
Oh

551
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,480
How the heck is it? Yeah, okay, and it's too big for her

552
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,800
So she'd have like sleeves that come all the way out like

553
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,840
Scientists oh wait, why didn't Brian you didn't read that out. How the frick do you draw a lab coat? Oh my god

554
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,920
I don't uh, so do you know that thing where you can imagine stuff in your head? I can't see stuff in my head

555
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,600
I have to like look at stuff. Thank you lorda storms for the extended membership

556
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,280
Scientist girl must glow like neon from experimenting on herself. She's actually a government

557
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,200
well

558
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,000
Right, so a lab coat can be open. I am tempted to do an open lab coat

559
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,480
and

560
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,840
Um, she's like really inappropriate in her conduct

561
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,880
I think I quite like that

562
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So that's what you're getting

563
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
and then

564
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,200
She doesn't wear anything in this area, but she will wear like purple panty loons

565
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,000
Okay, let's let's extend that there and then we'll just go up the body

566
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,960
and then

567
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,080
You will copy this say yeah, that's right. We're getting there. Yeah, that's right. Mm-hmm. You're gonna do a bit of

568
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:21,360
Right and then we're gonna erase all of this because I visually can't see it unless like this is gone

569
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,080
Okay, there we go. I can start I'm starting to see a little bit

570
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,360
Just a wee bit though

571
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,600
There's gonna be there's gonna have to be a lot of details on our lab coat for it to kind of

572
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,520
form a

573
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,240
Some sort of coherent design. Gonna be honest. It's not looking good already

574
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:56,720
But that's not gonna stop us when is when is being shit at anything ever stopped us reeflings. Hey, come on

575
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,840
Okay, there we have

576
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,720
something

577
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:12,160
But why are hips so big? You know what? It's fine. It's fine. Okay. And then first things first. She doesn't wear anything on

578
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,840
This area so we need to remove this

579
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,520
Like so

580
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,680
Is she petan? I think she's petan

581
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,920
I know emi's petan and I'm using emi's base, but like come on

582
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
Okay, there we go

583
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,800
Okay, we've got the lab coat sorted

584
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
She's awesome already

585
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,040
And then she wears purple

586
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Tongs

587
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
I'm just kind of

588
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,600
Wait, is there a sim? Wait, hold on. Let me look at the symbols of science again. I could maybe do a symbol

589
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,520
Oh

590
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,120
I've just got an idea. How about she wears something like this, right? Okay

591
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,920
but secretly

592
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,600
This is like

593
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:14,800
It goes to the side like that and it secretly like goes all the way up here like in some crazy kind of scheme design

594
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,960
I don't know if I'm making any sense and then it has the um

595
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,240
It has the neon green

596
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,160
And this time the scent we need to really zoom in for this one. Gotta get it accurate or else there's no point in doing it all

597
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:36,800
It's the atomic symbol like the radiation one. It's like the circle in the middle as well

598
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,160
Ah, yes, she has a triangle. Why yes, of course

599
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,280
And then obviously she has a pocket and then and and you know like instead of putting pens in it

600
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:56,000
She has like, I don't know a radioactive test tube that is literally glowing on her damn chest

601
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,440
because uh, you know

602
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,120
What when did a bit of radiation ever stop her? Let's be honest

603
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:09,920
A one-piece micro sling bikini the radio is say exactly she remember at the home. Yeah

604
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,480
Because and then like the string perfectly covers up her

605
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,960
You know

606
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,840
That's the biohazard. Okay. Well, she's got a biohazard. She's see then

607
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,840
um

608
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:32,720
Because she's a scientist she unironically wears like the steel tap steel toe cap to boots

609
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,120
So she wears like the nice big boots

610
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,920
that are uh approved. Um

611
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,360
I don't how do how do you draw steel?

612
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,720
What steel?

613
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,800
Steel toe capped boots. Jeez go to sleep already. My goodness

614
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,520
like the these ones

615
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,760
Oh my god, it looks like roman sandals, but it's because I don't know how to just draw them

616
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,480
But like she wears like big chunky boots. Okay

617
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,520
And she's got a little lab coat. She's got a little radioactive thing going on. I'm here for it. Honestly, uh

618
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,920
But

619
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,420
Because she's an inappropriate scientist

620
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:19,200
She has like decorations and stickers and stuff on her outfit that really shouldn't be on it

621
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,280
But that's pretty much it

622
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,760
Uh biohazard icon over the yeast infections

623
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,880
Uh, right your eyeballs. Let's draw your dna sequence eyeballs

624
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
Okay, wait, that's a bit too high up

625
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,800
Okay, now she is freaky and has like no emotions. So she's got like extra weirdness going on

626
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,280
So it's green

627
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,680
And then purple dna to connect green

628
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,440
The oxyl deoxyribonucleic acid

629
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Oh well

630
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,840
And then the purple I got purple. Nope that is purple

631
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,680
I thought that

632
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,560
I thought I caught that and then it's like goes over like this like in the dna sequence

633
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,080
I do love my dna. It's a double helix, which is extra cool

634
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:20,240
It means you can store even more genetic information on it. It's really cool. I mean I think that's an end right for her hair

635
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,880
I

636
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,640
Would love for her fringe to be pinned back

637
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,640
The question is what color should her hair be? Should it be black?

638
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,400
I don't think it should be purple

639
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,480
I think it actually should be black with like an accent of purple

640
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,800
So I actually want her fringe to be pinned back

641
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,720
So I don't know how you draw that though, but basically oh god

642
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,440
No, not the freaking baby like like it's pinned back

643
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,840
Because she needs to keep her hair out of her face, but she you know what I mean, right?

644
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,080
Right, you know, I mean like her thing and her little fringe is back

645
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,040
um

646
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:09,280
And then because she's in science she has to like have her hair in like little adorable bunches at the side

647
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,840
Um because you need to tie your hair back or it'll explode

648
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,360
Oh my god, what does it look like? Oh, she looks awful

649
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,720
Oh

650
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,720
Green with purple highlights

651
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,920
But yeah, she got like a little fringe back. I don't know how to draw it anime style, but her fringe is back. Okay

652
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,760
And then she's got purple highlights in her hair not green purple

653
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,200
Oh wait the freaking everyone has like some sort of highlight in her hair

654
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,480
Or should we pardon me? Sorry. Should we do block color?

655
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Once

656
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,320
Say

657
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,800
No, well because her eyes are mixed her hair should actually be mixed. You know that

658
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,080
If I think because it would it would like a

659
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,920
Um

660
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,080
Complement her wee eyes more. Oh wait. No, she's supposed to be emotionless

661
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,320
There she's so emotionless and she's tired because you know

662
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,760
No

663
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,760
Okay, I think we did it

664
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:22,160
She should have braces like a nerd. Okay, let's add the braces. Let's see. Let's get a little teeth shot from our little nerd

665
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:29,120
And just to really show the acts the colors like constantly switching back and forth

666
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,080
This one then this one then this one then this one then this one

667
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,600
And then we're going to yank this color right here

668
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,400
And then do this this this this and this is her teeth

669
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,920
And the braces just connect to one another like that

670
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,560
Yeah, that's how braces work right surely. I wouldn't know I'm brish

671
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,960
Okay, let me cook a lollipop armadillo girl who maybe has jewels on her armor

672
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,960
A contortionist girl since they can roll into balls

673
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,720
Gray as a primary color with perhaps orange and red

674
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,000
Loose clothes for aerodynamics a little shy, but not while performing

675
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,640
I'm not sure. Thank you for the tip tiny tiny

676
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I've seen armadillo. I don't know

677
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,880
Or a madillo and madillo and madillo. Let me just give her a neck again. Hold on a minute

678
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,600
It's timmy from south pot. No, right we need to give her a name

679
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,720
What's her name going to be?

680
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,760
She does science, but it's unethical

681
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,760
So call her unni. Oh, and she's we as well. So we'd call her unni

682
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,000
because you know

683
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
she got the

684
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,280
For no particular reason at all her name tag is going to be right here

685
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,040
She's called unni because she's unethical

686
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Oh, ne ne e like that unni and then

687
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,280

art discipline education information learning skill system technique branch

691
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,520
Erudition lore

692
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,320

ology is the study of whatever the subject that comes before it. So like bi ology is the study of life

695
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,880
Chem ology. I'm just kidding. But that that's actually true. That's actually true what I said there, but chem ology doesn't work

696
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:51,840
So unni ology welcome in unni ology. I actually am not that mad at the design. I think that's really funny

697
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,720
You know, I'm sure someone else could cook a lot better with that, but yeah, come on unni ology

01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,560
Also, she needs to have large ears sharp teeth and thick thighs

732
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,160
Also for personality. She would be very mischievous

733
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,000
An orc a tribal orc that wants you. Okay. Let's let's check out the color palette

734
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:57,200
Color palette first, you know the drill. Oh wait, hold on. I need it. I need it big, right? Okay. Lollipop skinny Maliki

01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,640
Thank you gaming kitsune for the suggestion

736
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:06,080
We're gonna do we're gonna have to change the skin right off the bat boom boom

737
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:12,640
And the ears start coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and I'm coming

738
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,360
And I'm coming and I can't stop coming. I'm addicted. Please. Please upload another audio, please

01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,600
Come on. There we go. She's like, uh, the reason she's so tiny is because

741
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,360
Because she's tiny, okay

742
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:40,960
If the girls were born to pander to you, what would she be? Um, I already picked what I wanted for gen two

743
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,680
I did not get what I wanted for gen two

744
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,720
um

745
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,240
Back and discuss it more at a later date right now

746
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,760
What I what I can't see my discoveries. Okay. Let's join her neck up. Okay, so

01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,080
So lollipop goblino with big boobs

748
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,240
Okay

749
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:17,360
Oh that one was now. Don't worry. It's perfectly natural if one's bigger than the other but maybe not to that degree

750
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,440
Okay, it's kind of like oh why oh my god

751
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,720
I'm a real artist now because all I'm doing is controls Ian

752
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,520
Okay, but what

753
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,400
What should we uh, you know what I like I like when the design comes over like this

754
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,800
Can I put her in rags? Oh my god, please can I put her in rags? I love rags

755
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,560
How do you draw rags?

756
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
I didn't think I would get this far. Hold on a minute

757
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,280
I want to know what's true anyone soon soon. No one would be revealed

758
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,560
uh

759
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,800
I'll show I'll show what I asked for and I'll show what I got basically what is going on in here

760
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,840
We're putting boobs on a lollipop

761
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,360
And I suck at it

762
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:13,200
But we're got we've got hicks and bacon. We've got uneology, which actually really like the idea of

763
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,680
unironically getting her developed

764
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:21,440
Uh, we've got jar jar binks the milk milk slime. Um, and then we're currently working on

765
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,840
A little tiny orc that loves to our word

766
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:35,200
There's no two ways about it. Did you give her a name? She likes to hunt. Okay, so she's into prey

767
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,640
Okay, she's into the prey. Was it prey play? Is that what you guys taught me like literally yesterday?

768
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,280
She's into prey play. Okay, not the amen. Okay, not the hot amen

769
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,400
That's supposed to be two hands together is not working

770
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,320
Pitcher plant lollipop that attracts pdf files and eats them

771
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,280
Oh

772
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:06,800
Gen two idea a hypnotic cuttlefish, but she loves slime girls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No no miss. I see how it is. I see how it is

773
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,080
Uh, grembo. Thank you for the tip rags that barely cover

774
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,320
Okay, I like that hold on. I guess I do like a sideways thing so it covers like this

775
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,760
But then like that bit skin

776
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,560
And it's all kind of like being pulled

777
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,040
Uh, no, I do like a picture plant idea. It's not the worst

778
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:39,200
But uh, maybe the attraction on is a bit of a oh, not sure we can really do that one chief

779
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:46,880
Uh, thank you for the suggestion on the left. Right. So this this is how it works, right? Surely this is how it works, right?

780
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,680
So in order to

781
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,360
What are you drawing? I don't know

782
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,040
I would have to go like that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

783
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,200
And then what I don't know. Well, just keep trying. Okay

784
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,920
Then that would have to be your skin

785
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,200
So then you need to you need a smaller line to symbolize that it's skin here. Oh

786
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,480
Sorry, I'm having to like talk myself through this process. Oh god, right

787
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,920
So if it's a single line, it shows that it's like a wee bit of skin, right? Okay. Yeah, that's fine

788
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,920
And then in order to compliment the green

789
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,800
Yes, we're actually going to do a paler brown

790
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,720
For the rags that should do it venus venus more like a penis fly trap

791
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,280
All right. Well, you as violers don't fucking V say so so

792
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,240
Shit, what do you want?

793
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:00,480
God, you guys are hard to impress even when I entertain you with a slain girl. It's still not enough for you. Is it?

794
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,360
Shopping baby, okay

795
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,040
This is how it works truly, right? So this is clearly rags, right?

796
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,720
Clearly and then

797
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,240
God, I like how it extends over her freaking elbow. That's how big it is

798
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,000
And we'll do we'll leave in the under boob as well. That's a loop

799
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,000
Okay, and then you just kind of draw like that

800
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,920
How does that look from afar? Whoa, wait that actually looks kind of good

801
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:42,880
Am I I'm I just am I being delusional or does that actually look kind of good? I think I'm being delusional

802
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,560
I think I need a good bed

803
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,880
I can't tell if I'm being delusional or if that kind of looks like a bit thingy

804
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:01,840
Uh, strongy slain girls and goblins are top tier. Yeah, I'm like, is this delusion or is this actually kind of good? I don't know

805
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,080
That's probably just pure delusion. Right. Let's first get rid of these

806
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,440
Why?

807
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:15,120
Right first, it's a lot easier to just do this first instead of the backwards way that I just did it, but yeah

808
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,240
The boobs are a bit how dare you

809
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,120
How dare you this isn't you're watching

810
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,080
Uh top tier rated vtubers be be born

811
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,040
Birth from my loins. I'm just down it. Okay. So first thing you do this

812
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,280
What strongy? That's just your design. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know just give me a second to freaking catch up

813
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,160
If she's wearing rags, okay

814
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:46,560
It has to be like really sporadic because she's like tried her best to cover up

815
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,960
But she's not the smartest. Okay, so she's just kind of got things that are like pulling against her skin

816
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,520
in order to do this

817
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,920
um

818
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,840
And

819
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,960
Oh, you know what fuck it. Why not?

820
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,320
We'll do have like a random knot in the middle because she had to like knot it in order to like hold them together

821
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,480
Because because that's how it works. Okay. She's trying her best. Be nice to her

822
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,880
You've not even given her a name yet

823
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,160
Right, that's it reeflings name that are word goblin right now

824

01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,600
There that's her name jumps a cox

834
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:50,000
See this is why I should name because she would never get that you'd never get that jumps a cox. Okay

835
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,760
She's a noblin. Oh, yeah, you like that. We're gonna call her a noblin because she's a wee little

836
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,560
Little bit lit in noblin there. Her nickname is noblin and her her her full legal name is jumps a cox

837
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,200
Nob goblin literally

838
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Goblin my noblin

839
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,840
Right stop. I'm getting excited. I'm getting excited. Calm down. Calm down. Okay. There boom

840
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,920
Okay, so her rags are like tied up like that. She's tried her best

841
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,400
But she doesn't really care at the end of the day right

842
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,440
She would have dark markings to like compliment

843
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:28,160
Her thingy and they start lighting up them. We're excited she gets

844
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:38,960
And like all her symbols are like off like I don't know fertility or stuff. I don't know how this works. She'll have like loads of symbols

845
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,240
Maybe it's just be her veins. Honestly. It's probably just like her veins and stuff

846
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,360
So the more you see like her heart and stuff that's the more wait hearts on the left side a little bit

847
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,160
If that her left then it's the heart should kind of be on the side a bit more

848
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,680
There we go. That's the heart beautiful stunning gorgeous. Um

849
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,000
Can you like tribal tattoos? I don't I mean I get I just

850
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,400
And they just show up a bit more

851
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,120
Oh my tiny squid mirror

852
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,640
Get out of the kitchen. You might

853
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,920
No, what's wrong with the design

854
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:23,520
Oh garden rams. He says get out of the kitchen. What do you mean? You don't like my tribal design. Come on

855
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,640
You know how to draw tight. I don't even know what tribal freaking tattoos look like

856
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,720
There and she has like markings all over and got like one big one on her leg

857
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
And then this is the conception

858
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,360
Hey

859
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,720
Um, and then we've got uh the wiggly

860
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,440
The wiggly meets the egg

861
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,320
This is the ovum

862
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,400
That's the ovum over

863
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,520
And that's the swimmer

864
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,480
And she's all about the uh, oh that's

865
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,320
I

866
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,680
I'm supposed to have to you know, just put one up there in the shop in there

867
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,240
She's keltic war paint. She's war paint on her face. Okay. Okay. I'll give her war paint

868
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:20,400
She's always ready to raid, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's like a war thing and she's like, um, always

869
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,240
Oh, shit. I'm covering this up. I'm always ready

870
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,040
to

871
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,040
And then in in big bold

872
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
That's her that's her little her mole

873
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
I'm always ready to ride

874
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,680
Uh pray play. Yes. Yes. Yes jumps on you

875
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:48,240
She's really into breeding. She has to have a womb tattoo. Right. Okay fine. Ah little laughs

876
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,440
How does one

877
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:59,360
So in the oh, that's very large actually in the middle of her tattoo is the egg that you have to go for. Okay

878
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,520
um, but it's not going to be a love heart because

879
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,960
It's going to be an upside down love heart because it's not being conceived from love. It's been conceived from the

880
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:18,160
Alternative so that's these are clearly her little egg holders. They're her ovaries

881
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,400
um

882
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,560
and then she's got like a little pipe going on

883
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,200
and then

884
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,080
Just a few like little things that they should be creating vtuber freaking

885
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,080
Hmm

886
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:38,080
Uh, how you call them again, we'll do the little circle inside. That's the ovum. That's the egg waiting to be fertilized

887
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,000
Got all of science. It's so cool. Honestly. I mean, I think it's cool

888
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,080
Okay, there she's got a little womb tattoo as well

889
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,200
And then she's got like little swirls down here just because she can

890
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,800
Wait a minute. Mercy did swirls on my leg. I'm copying mercy. Uh

891
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,400
I'm really bad for that. My brain's just like, um, you've seen this once before so do it again. I was like, no

892
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,320
It's a little random markings. Why not? Oh, maybe she has scars

893
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,480
Oh my god, she would have like scars because people would try and fight her off

894
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,080
But she always wins in that end anyway, so there's no point in fighting her. Hold on

895
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,600
She has like a teeth mark here

896
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,880
Yeah, there's like no point in fighting her like good luck. I honestly look like a smiley face

897
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:35,200
The the head and uh, thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate the support and she got like a big scar

898
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,160
That used to be an open cut up here, but it's not anymore

899
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,480
and then

900
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:47,600
uh, maybe a shoulder bite like uh coffin of andy and lele style

901
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,560
and then

902
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,320
Maybe on her finger because like someone like she went for someone and they weren't having it

903
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,680
But she managed to like not hurt herself

904
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,520
anywhere

905
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,680
Scars or tally marks does she have colored nails?

906
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
Sure

907
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
Yeah

908
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,880
Okay, we need to give her her eyeballs. Oh my god, how do you translate her?

909
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,160
Design into an eyeball

910
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,160
Um

911
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:32,480
She would have teeth she would have like orc. Oh, sorry. She would have orc teeth, right? Surely surely she would have orc teeth

912
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,520
So she would have like the big teeth that come out here. I love them and orcs have the underbite teeth

913
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,640
And then she like smiley. She's all happy

914
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:45,840
Okay, open your eyes, please so we can take a look at your eyeballs

915
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,400
Come

916
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,720
Okay, so what would your eyeballs actually be did I draw your eyeballs? No, I didn't

917
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,600
Yeah, let's draw it up here

918
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Come. Oh, no, your hair is gonna be in the way

919
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,560
Okay, one big eyeball

920
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
What would your design

921
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,360
be

922
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,920
I feel like we've got what is an accent color to green and like tan

923
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,360
Brown, I mean she could have brown eyes

924
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,480
And maybe I put wee sandals on her so she can run after you and her wee flip flops

925
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,840
So as you're trying to run away from her all you hear is like

926
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:29,600
Over server freaking sandals honestly, that's hilarious. Like you can't get away. It doesn't matter how far

927
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:35,120
She's literally the like you can't it doesn't matter how far you run. She's like right behind you

928
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:40,080
Okay, she's gonna wear sandals. So it's got a little bit in between the tool here

929
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,720
How do sandals look when you're wearing them?

930
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,280
Ah, yes, I remember. Oh my gosh. I'm like a five-eyed

931
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,920
There so like and just just like behind you

932
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:56,000
Doesn't matter how far you run. She's she's right behind you

933
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,440
Little flip-flops little flip-flop gang flip

934
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,480
flop

935
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,560
Approaching sounds apperate. Oh arching

936
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,760
sounds

937
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,480
Mm-hmm

938
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
There we go flip-flop approaching sounds

939
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,480
Uh, I think she would actually maybe have brown eyes

940
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:29,280
Do we give her the old hex method where it's like brown in the middle and then tan on the outside

941
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,280
And then a darker brown

942
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:39,280
For the actual people what would the symbol be it has to be has to be an egg in an ovum

943
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,160
Thank you mama for the big asset lollipop. It's glorious

944
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,200
Big asset lollipop. Oh the thing

945
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:53,520
So this I'm wondering if we could secretly draw a little swimmer and her pupil

946
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,360
I think we could which is a little like from afar though

947
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,120
A bit shit, but honestly

948
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:07,200
Honestly, you went up high lolly. Is that what you want? Oh, no lollipop lollipop lollipop

949
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,160
What did you do

950
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,520
I can't remember do you like

951
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,600
Okay, and then we're gonna draw

952
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,040
The egg in the ovum not the best pupils, but you know why we've done it

953
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,720
She looks like a freaking alien at this point. Okay

954
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:48,080
It's that's the egg and the little one thing going on and the we spare me wearing me

955
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,280
Oh, this is awful. This is cursed

956
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,160
But vealer already has an r-word in goblin her name is joining as terrible

957
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,880
Refling journal supposed to say that I like right here

958
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:08,320
We are gonna have lovely luscious wavy brown hair like I'm talking hair down to the floor

959
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480
I love when hair goes down to the floor

960
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,400
So we've got luscious bang. So let's do the bang

961
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,160
And then she has like this gorgeous

962
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,800
hair that

963
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:25,520
Oh, maybe it should like rest on the bosom a little bit on her fondle of bosoms

964
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,760
But then it keeps oh, no, that doesn't work

965
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,960
Well, the back of the hair can definitely go like all the way of the back. That's fine with me

966
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,840
Maybe it just comes to us like uh in the middle

967
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:44,400
Like predator style like it just all comes down

968
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:51,200
Leave her bald don't say such things we put so much love into her

969
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,720
Okay, we definitely need to deal with her mouth though. I don't I don't want to be rude

970
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,120
But your mouth is starting to worry me a little bit

971
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:03,600
Okay, and then we'll just kind of have a little accent pieces here

972
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,800
And then we can remove this part because this is where it looks really weird

973
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And then can we

974
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,640
Maybe do this close enough. Uh, right. Let's try that again. We'll see what is the

975
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,360
Impeding ours

976
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,520
Uh color wise

977
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,520
What is

978
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,320
Ah, this bit here we go. I got it. Are you squid me right now?

979
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:39,200
Something every girl has a straight bangs. I sense some of my house leave my straight bangs out of this

980
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:43,920
I'll love my straight bangs. Okay. Hmm. Oh wait. Do they actually all have straight bangs? No

981
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,160
frickin

982
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,600
uneology

983
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
Hazard things pinned back get wreck

984
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,720
Anonymous, how do you say such things to me anonymous? I'm gonna fart on your eyelashes

985
01:31:55,360 --> 01:32:01,280
Stony you gave her hair, but you just let it flow down. Are you confirming that you're no

986
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:08,720
I I don't I don't it's not me. I promise. I'm designing something here. It's not me

987
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
It's me

988
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,840
Me

989
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:21,200
Why did you space out that here? Let's just close all the gap. Don't mind us close gap. Boom. No, let's try again

990
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,440
What is open here?

991
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,800
This

992
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,440
Is it that be honest? Was it that? Is that the reason why it's not closed? Boom. Are you?

993
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:38,720
Am I being squitted on I'm being squitted on by ms pain. Are you what are you doing ms pain everything else is blocked off

994
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
I can see everything else is blocked off

995
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,880
Come on. Oh, there is sorry. That was really obvious

996
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,160
There we go, she's got two different. Yeah. Yeah, fuck it right here. How's a gradient? Why not get darker at the bottom?

997
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,440
He he he I guide it. Okay, and then

998
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,160
for the mouse let's maybe relax a bit on it and

999
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,760
We will make it a slightly less intimidating

1000
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,000
Uh, maybe just one odd tooth. Why not?

1001
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:19,280
And then she's all smiley and sweet, but it's because she's secretly about to do something very bad

1002
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:24,640
Uh, and she's all she's like a little sweetheart and you're like, oh this orc

1003
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,080
I don't know why orcs have such a bad reputation. Seriously. Why do people hate them so much?

1004
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,920
And then little do you know what's about to come next?

1005
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,880
Oh, yeah, we did it. We did the design. So now

1006
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,000
We have one more design and then we're done. So

1007
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,080
Hmm what we think and not gonna let her go feral

1008
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:52,000
Oh, they have long ears. How could I forget? She needs her long side late ears. Hold on. Hold on. Let me add the ears real quick

1009
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,080
And this is jumps on. Yeah

1010
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,480
Oh

1011
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:04,400
Why am I born like this? Okay. She has adorable little ears that come out from this side

1012
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,880
Like this like these kind of ears

1013
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,080
Ta-da, all done

1014
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:18,960
You what orc or goblin? I don't know one or the other. Are you squid me? Noblin if you if you prefer

1015
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,480
Red black gold color scheme discord kitten girl. Red black and gold. Why not?

1016
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,200
We don't have a red

1017
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,200
We have avoided red for some reason

1018
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:36,480
Right red black and gold black and gold wasn't that song when a fish swims out of the ocean

1019
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,800
And the legs they start as walking

1020
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,760
Oh

1021
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,600
Red black and gold discord kitten

1022
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,720
Ray

1023
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:12,720
We've just made belgium. So she's belgium for one 10 out of 10 would let the gobby. Oh my god, her nickname would so be gobby

1024
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,200
Gobby

1025
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,640
Oh, yeah

1026
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,880
I think what is she singing you know how it's like when the fish swim out in the ocean

1027
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:33,360
And legs they started when the fish swam out of the ocean

1028
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,240
What is you what does google say?

1029
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,920
Oh, it's called the song is called black and gold. Yeah, no wonder. Okay. Are you ready for the lyrics?

1030
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,920
I'm gonna sing it because I don't want to copyright

1031
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,720
Oh, wait, hold on. I need to mute the background music just to really not confuse you

1032
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:55,920
When if the fish swam out of the ocean and grew legs and they started walking

1033
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:03,040
And the apes climbed down from the trees and grew a tail and they started talking

1034
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,320
And the stars fell out of the sky

1035
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,920
And the tears rolled into the ocean

1036
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:17,040
And now i'm looking for a reason why you even set my world in emotion

1037
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Ka-mmm

1038
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:26,320
Because if you're not really here, I don't remember this though. Where's the black and gold part? Here we go

1039
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,880
I want to be next to you

1040
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,680
black and gold

1041
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,520
black and gold

1042
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,280
black and gold

1043
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,320
That's it

1044
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:40,000
But there was a song it goes like that just tape it and i'm gonna no copyright

1045
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:46,480
I'm gonna have the most delirious sleep of my life. I'm gonna wake up tomorrow not remember. I did any of this

1046
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,040
Because I haven't slept in like how long?

1047
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,720
quite well

1048
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:56,080
I'm gonna have any recollection that I designed any of these so it'll be a nice surprise to wake up to

1049
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,080
Do you have a backstory idea? Wait, what was it? I don't even remember what the question was

1050
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,960
Discord kitten someone said discord kitten. Okay, right this this

1051
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,240
P Y R D K

1052
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,640
Y K I N

1053
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,720
There we go. Spell it like that just i'm feeling feeling quirky

1054
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:25,360
So i'm gonna spell it like that no stroney the goblin is singing this no matter how fast no matter how far you can always hear

1055
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,640
The squeaking behind the lollipop goblin is coming to town

1056
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,200
lollipop

1057
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:32,400
goblin

1058
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,400
Are you squiddling me around?

1059
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,720
I've left goblin a gob on my knob with all without permission

1060
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,680
Gob on my knob schlob on my cob

1061
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,840
Norn on the cob and she give me hay right on the bay

1062
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:53,520
Check in with me and do your job right you what are you you're a discord kitten?

1063
01:37:53,680 --> 01:38:00,240
Obviously you need the headset or else it's not complete. How can you be the stereotype and you need braces?

1064
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:08,640
Get braces right automatically. She's disqualified from being british. So unfortunately it is what it is

1065
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,200
We will give her red and gold braces because we can't

1066
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,440
Oh

1067
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,440
That's what

1068
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:26,240
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Get braces get braced on get braced on i'm getting braced getting braced. That's right

1069
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,440
And then she's got a big old she's got a big old smile

1070
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:35,040
Because she likes to show off. She's got braces. She's so mature for her age

1071
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,560
Why am I grooming her? She's not even real

1072
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:44,400
There just just smile and there i'm just gonna put erratic dots in your teeth. Okay

1073
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,720
It looks like you've got like red chili peppers stuck or something

1074
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,960
okay

1075
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,480
Yo, is that the flag of belgium unironically though, but how will she?

1076
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,600
with braces

1077
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,400
Because she can right if she's a discord kitten. What eyeball are we giving you?

1078
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:07,040
Come on. Let's get that pupil design. Let's milk that pupil design for everything move go

1079
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Right if you're a discord kitten

1080
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:19,520
What's the discord symbol look like? Hold on let me look it up. What does discord symbol look like?

1081
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,280
Image

1082
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:28,720
Okay, the discord symbol right so first do a circle because we need it to be in the circle

1083
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:34,720
Okay, the circle is gonna wear the headset but in say the circle is the discord

1084
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,120
Who goes there?

1085
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:44,720
Big black cat ears and tail actual cat girl not just headphones gimmick make her very desperate for love and attention

1086
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
But a real gamer girl veteran

1087
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,760
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There we go. So that's her pupil

1088
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,640
uh

1089
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,800
I would have to be red though

1090
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,400
Right, you want a real neko real neko. So let's get rid of this

1091
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:07,440
Mmm, and you want a real tail. I can definitely do that. Let's give her black

1092
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
um

1093
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,560
Thingy so she's got a lovely tail

1094
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,480
No, that looks like a dinosaur or something

1095
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,920
No, don't get skinny

1096
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,080
Oh, it's your boy

1097
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:28,800
Yeah, we go she's got a little tail and has a little Brenda then she's so happy to see you

1098
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:37,440
Dollar signs from all the sugar daddies cat girls speaking of a cat girl. You'll never guess what Fu is

1099
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,280
Fu is sometimes gets referred to as not a neko

1100
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
This is not fun for Fu

1101
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,560
But she is a nekodese

1102
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,840
What color though red red eye seems like really intense, but

1103
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,080
I think it's gonna have to be

1104
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:01,760
Unless we do like something really weird like that. That's the weirdest pupils. I think we're drawing. It looks like a pig's nose

1105
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,640
I understand now why you said pig

1106
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,800
I didn't understand. She's gonna need a you blue shirt, honestly

1107
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,400
I'm gonna have to redesign that pupil a little bit or it's just gonna have to be like one shade of red

1108
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,880
Well, not one shade like I'll make it later

1109
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,680
Oh

1110
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:26,160
That's even more like a pig. Who's thought right? How have I done a 3d pig? That's honestly such a good like pig

1111
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,240
Right, it's not working

1112
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,640
The pupil is just gonna have to have neko ears. There's no other way about it

1113
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,800
The pupil is having neko ears. Did I make myself clear?

1114
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,080
Okay, so pupil

1115
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,760
Neko ears. Oh, this looks even worse

1116
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,760
Oh brother, it's probably the best I've got

1117
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:58,400
It's not very good up next the pig girl. No, no pig. Go right. Okay. She's got a tail

1118
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,160
Next we need to do her hair

1119
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,080
um

1120
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,640
If she's a neat do we cover up her feet like her eyes

1121
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,880
Oh

1122
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,440
She looks like

1123
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,840
Or something like one of the characters from there

1124
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,680
Oh, right. I need to get rid of the teeth. I'm so sorry. They're completely throwing me off

1125
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:25,760
They need to go. You got to go buddy. What do you mean? You have to go

1126
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,640
I can't handle you

1127
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,960
Wow

1128
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,200
Right you do you you you you

1129
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,560
And then draw a circle

1130
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:46,480
Circle and then draw the cat ears and then and so that's just it looks like a freaking bunny rabbit head. Do you know that?

1131
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,840
Only once I discovered I think sometimes her love for stylistic pupils make cause issues

1132
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:00,080
Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it? And she's like, uh, she's like, uh, wait, how do you draw a hegeo face?

1133
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,080
I hate you

1134
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:08,400
Okay, and she's got her mouth open and it's like her tongue is it? What the fuck? How do you know this?

1135
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,280
Someone stick their tongue out right now so I can use it as a reference

1136
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,560
Oh, this is awful

1137
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,400
Why is a hegeo so hard to draw? Who did this?

1138
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:29,360
Why is it sideways? Right straightforward tongue, please. Thank you. And then

1139
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:36,320
What why hello? Why is it so hard to draw? I literally have a reference right in front of me

1140
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,800
right

1141
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,800
First stick the tongue out

1142
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,960
Okay

1143
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,560
I'm literally right that's supposed to be the tongue wait. I've not done the mouth yet

1144
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,240
And then the mouth is like a dark opening above it. Okay

1145
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,320
Do that

1146
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:56,640
And then color in the tongue. Okay there now you can tell that I'm trying to go for it

1147
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,200
Jeez that was like way harder than it had to be

1148
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:06,080
Okay, we did it we've done the face out of all the faces. There's a

1149
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,920
Okay, go away jar jar slime

1150
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:17,680
We've had enough of your shenanigans right here next a discord kitten always has long hair. Okay

1151
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:22,800
But because she's doing a hegeo her little ears would be down so first

1152
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,480
Long hair would we do like

1153
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,400
Something I feel like she has to have something

1154
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:37,200
I mean we'll put a bow in her hair just to make her slightly different. What's that bangs again?

1155
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:43,760
Absolutely. No, let's give her a side swoop. Why not? A little emo cat thing going on

1156
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,640
Wow

1157
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,160
Okay, there we go

1158
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,120
And then we'll put a little bow in her hair right here

1159
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:56,640
A little jingle bell because you know how cats like those little bell things always get sold to them

1160
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,120
My tongue is ready for you strongy. Thank you. I will draw it right now briefly

1161
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten

1162
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:09,360
Uh her hair is not going to be her hair is going to be long, but it's not going to be that long

1163
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,360
And it's actually going to be a blunt cut

1164
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,080
um

1165
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,440
Because we don't want it to be

1166
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:25,120
Not a blunt cut. Yep. Okay. I mean that's explanation enough and all honestly

1167
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:31,440
You don't really have to go further than that and then we do a little hair thing here to mesh it a bit better

1168
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,600
And then we introduce her ears which are pressed

1169
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,400
Our ears up here and a cat. Yeah, okay

1170
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:43,760
If the ears are up there the ears like bunch out like up here

1171
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,560
And they're kind of like downwards because she's doing a hegeo. So it's supposed to be like

1172
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:53,360
You know, I mean like this ear is getting completely hidden by this accessory

1173
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:59,120
Who put the accessory right there? I don't know. It wasn't me, but someone did put it there and they should be embarrassed

1174
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:03,440
If she's a big weeb maybe mess up the hair

1175
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,320
Like this

1176
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,880
There she's a still got a blunt cut, but it's only blunt because

1177
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:18,080
She just doesn't go get it cut at all and doesn't maintain it whatsoever

1178
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:24,800
Okay, and then if we copy that and we can paste it on the neck and we can do that

1179
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:31,440
Well, maybe let's not color in her eyeballs. That would look rather odd. I oh are you squiddin me right now?

1180
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,440
By the pope identify yourself

1181
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:39,760
Suggestions tongue piercing bondage restraint on her tail that matches her choker on her neck

1182
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:44,480
Short nails painted gold or black side swept short black hair

1183
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:51,280
Gold jewelry to compliment her black slash red lounge wear outfit. Give her a giant fish plushie

1184
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,320
Fish plushie. Fish plushie

1185
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,920
Thank you for the

1186
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,800
tip

1187
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,360
Again Raven. Thank you

1188
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:10,160
I I'm gonna be honest. My brain's starting to shut down. I'm I am now working against the clock before my brain stops talking

1189
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:14,960
Um, uh, we are under the clock. I repeat rooflings. We are under the motherfucker clock

1190
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:20,880
I don't want to fall asleep, but I think I might fall asleep, but I don't want to fall asleep on stream

1191
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,520
That's not a nice

1192
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:25,920
Black please. Thank you. She's got black ears

1193
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:33,520
Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Just give her black ears because she's a nickel

1194
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,440
And she's from belgium and and her catchphrase is

1195
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,720
I can't remember how to spell dutch

1196
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,240
I've completely forgotten how to spell in dutch

1197
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,240
But she's fucking belgium

1198
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,160
Um, I'm trying. I'm trying. Oh my god. We're against the clock. Okay

1199
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:06,960
We need a light pink for the inner colors of her ear holes because we don't want her to not have light pink because

1200
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,280
That's like humanizing her

1201
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:16,560
You and I need to I'm trying to sleep somewhere. Congrats on 12k. I'm not at 12k. I just hit 11k. I know that for a fact

1202
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:20,320
I'm not at 12k. Okay. Her hair is going to be a light brown

1203
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,320
Can I do it? No. Okay. Well, I tried. Uh, let's try that again

1204
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:29,040
Let's close off the gaps so we can get a nice light brown going on close

1205
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,000
Closing the gaps closing the gaps

1206
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:36,880
Looking for gaps looking for gaps. We're gonna do a light brown

1207
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,680
I yet

1208
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,720
Okay, there we go. There we go. There we go. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there

1209
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,520
Okay, okay. Let's let's put her together put her together put her together right

1210
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,560
She has a tail. The tail is black

1211
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,760
Um

1212
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,840
But on the end of the tail she has the same bail. Oh, that looks like a pokemon. What's that pokemon's name?

1213
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,040
It's not chingling. It's the other one

1214
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:09,520
Oh, there's a pokemon that looks like it's that and it's not got that name

1215
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,760
But it looks like what i've just drawn. I think i'm drawing pokemon from memory. I'm so sorry

1216
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:21,360
Actually, I should do an msp drawn pokemon from memory. That would be insane. That's right

1217
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
And then the elastic band

1218
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,200
It would technically be black, but i'm gonna have to use red because I don't have anything else

1219
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,880
And then the choker has the exact same

1220
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,400
Like vibe

1221
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:40,560
What's the pokemon chain chero? I think it's chain chero

1222
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,440
There we go

1223
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:50,720
I mean, yeah, like technically that band would be black and then this would be black. How do you symbolize it?

1224
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,720
I guess gray symbolize it. We're gray

1225
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,400
um

1226
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,400
For the actual outfit

1227
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,240
Body restraints on her tail that match her choker short nails

1228
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,040
That are gold. I can do that

1229
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,760
Boop boop

1230
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,920
Um

1231
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:17,280
Jewelry, I don't know cats like shiny things. No cats aren't man. Give her a giant fish

1232
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:21,360
She likes she's got a little fish plushie. I know you said giant

1233
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,800
But I actually like the idea that she's always got a fish stuffy on her because she's scared to go alone

1234
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,120
Because her lore is that she was abandoned

1235
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:39,040
And then she always wants a fishy to hold close because fishy were her only companions. No, she's not vegetarian

1236
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,920
Just really gotta get in that real quick. No, she's not vegetarian. What would you wear though?

1237
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,880
If you're a discord kitten you wear like next to nothing

1238
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:55,680
I feel like you'd be in a spaghetti strap like crop top thing going on

1239
01:50:56,640 --> 01:51:00,080
Or maybe it would be like super stylized and she's got like

1240
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:04,400
Bulging out the side, but she wouldn't have anything shown. You know, I mean

1241
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:11,200
But I'd be like how does that shirt even work? Oh, I mean, I guess it would work if it went around the side like that

1242
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,160
So technically this is her skin

1243
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:19,760
Hold on. Let me zoom in. Let me enolize that's right. Hold on

1244
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,840
If I want to pull off what I want to pull off first. I must color it all in

1245
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,800
Okay, first color it in

1246
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,280
color color color color color color

1247
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:37,040
And then we redraw it with a thin black line. That's how art works. Okay, it just works

1248
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,160
Not now Todd Howard. I need to go to bed

1249
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:47,760
But it just works. No, Todd Howard. Stop it. Please change. Okay, so this is technically

1250
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,600
You know what right

1251
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,720
And then the actual shirt

1252
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:02,560
Oh god, I forgot what the Belgian flag looks like. Hold on. It'll bell gian flag. Oh god, I cannot spell all

1253
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:09,120
I'm falling asleep on stream and I don't want to please brain. Give me like give me five more minutes

1254
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,080
Just give me one more chance

1255
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:21,760
Thank you, that is my rendition of that one Japanese song that I have absolutely no idea what it's about

1256
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,640
It just goes nowhere. The song has an English line and it just goes

1257
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:31,200
Just give me one more chance

1258
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,040
You know what song I'm on a bit, right?

1259
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,600
You know what song I'm on a bit?

1260
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,600
Surely surely copium

1261
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,720
Okay, does that make sense what we're looking at here if I zoom out does it make more sense?

1262
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,120
Yeah, yeah, it makes sense. Okay next shorts

1263
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:59,360
No shorts, uh, all right you you

1264
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,680
Can't put window or you want a window

1265
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,880
I don't do that do skin color

1266
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,240
And then draw

1267
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,120
The shape

1268
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,600
Go Belgium forever

1269
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,360
Why else do I know about Belgium? Oh, that's her catchphrase

1270
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,720
She wants she wants mayonnaise

1271
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:31,120
Belgians and she wants your mail. Okay, because Belgians put mail on fries or chips

1272
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,880
Or deep-fried potato. I don't know what you want to call it

1273
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:40,800
But that's what they do and but the mail is her version of ink

1274
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:44,320
Wait, is she Belgian? Yeah, we made her Belgian as fuck

1275
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,360
She's a whole hat with the all you know

1276
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:52,480
And she wants to watch new kids turbo with you. She's like so out the wazoo

1277
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,040
New kids turbo

1278

Come on brain

1287
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,880
Like you literally have like like two more minutes you have to do this for

1288
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:34,960
You're fine. The design is there. Just get it out. Just get it out

1289
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,840
Just get it out

1290
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,840
Come on

1291
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,160

wiggle wiggle wiggle

1295
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:56,400
P. O. V. I am a pigeon that wants to meet with you

1296
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:04,400
Right, what do we want to do? I've already forgotten what I was gonna do. Um

1297
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,400
Let's give her a make cruel

1298
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,120
Tongue

1299
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:14,640
And that's it. That's all she needs and then again, we'll just do the Belgian colors

1300
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:18,240
Let's do a little bit of black

1301
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,480
Then let's do a little bit of yellow

1302
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,600
And let's do a little bit of red

1303
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:30,160
And then oh, that's not even the spread though. It needs to be even or else. It doesn't look good right black

1304
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,440
yellow

1305
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,840
And red

1306
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,320
Okay, there we go

1307
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,160
And then she needs

1308
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,160
thigh high socks

1309
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:46,560
And you'll never guess what the color scheme of the thigh high socks are gonna be you're gonna absolutely

1310
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:52,160
Hit your panty. Oh wait, hold on. I can just like draw it straight on it goes black

1311
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,800
Pajama cut me through the tongue

See through I don't even get through that. Oh, I see in snow berries

1313
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:13,200

1314
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,680
Oh

01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,280
Then red no yellow

1316
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,080
Yellow

1317
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:28,640
High snowberries and daddas alike. I hope you guys are doing well. We're currently designing gen 2

1318
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:32,960
We are doing the last design

1319
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:36,160
Believe it or not. I've actually smoked this

1320
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:43,520
But why not I take you through memory lane of what we've done just to recap really quickly

1321
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,960
On what devious designs we've come up with. Okay

1322
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:54,480
I'm not sure you're ready for it. But hey, oh, that's that's the fun in designing

1323
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:57,760
Hello. Hi reader. Thank you for coming in

1324
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,000

Just let me quickly right here we go. I will take you through so

1326
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:11,120
Everyone wouldn't shut the f up about a freaking slime girl. So I made the ugliest slime girl possible. Her color scheme is blue white and

1327
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:20,480
Magenta I guess her pupil shape is blue with a magenta drop. She's ugly as anything. I despise her

1328
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,720
Her nickname is jar jar goops

1329
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,000
Um, and her name is slimy slime McGee

1330
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:30,560
And her catchphrase is misa join a V sucky. Okay

01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:38,000
So this is her nice and ugly. This buys it. She's in a one-piece swimsuit

1334
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:56,400
Um, and when she cancels stream she goes. Oh my tummy hurts stream is cancelled

She also has braces as well and our twining colors. Um, and that is our little crazy lab scientist

1374
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,560
And then we have our beloved

She's a little r wordy. So not very, uh, not very

1383
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:41,040
Good to go, but she does have a womb tattoo. Um, it's an upside down heart

1384
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:45,040
There's no actual heart in her womb tattoo because it's not always

1385
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,680
Uh, you didn't always want that

1386
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,040

1387
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:55,280
Ignore the fact that aces hair is hiding right on top of her. She's got one tooth and she looks very

1388
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Um, nice

1389
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:05,360
She looks very friendly and approachable, but uh, unfortunately that is not the reality once you actually get to know her because it's over for you

1390
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:08,720
Um, her markings on her body again

1391
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:13,280

02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:23,040
Um, and then she has the egg egg and then a very unique symbol that has never been done in history before very true very true

1394
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,520
and she has sandals

1395
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,120
Um, and uh, even though you may try and get away from her

1396
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:35,040
You will always hear the sound of flip-flops approaching you doesn't really matter. Uh, what uh, necessary

1397
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,680
stage we're at. Um

1398
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:41,840
But her hair is a lighter brown on top and a gradient to a darker brown

1399
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:48,240
And her clothing is rags that she put together because she doesn't really see the need for clothes. So there you go

1400
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,280
um

1401
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:55,520
And then we are working on the last design, which is our

1402
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:59,200
discord kitten. Uh, she's belgian

1403
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:05,760
Um, her pupils are like a head with nickel ears and then a pupil like an actual pupil

1404
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:10,880
She has braces, but I had to remove it because she's doing the hegeo face

1405
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:12,880
um

1406
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,160
And she's got like a little side thing going on

1407
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:21,600
And a little window that you can see actually I've not drawn the line. Oh, how could I forget the line?

1408
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,400
Let's zoom right back in there. What do I think I'm doing?

1409
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,280
Oh

1410
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,280
six just like that

1411
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:31,280
um

1412
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,360
And then she's holding a fishy

1413
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:38,960
Oh, sorry. Um, her tails. Oh, sorry and her tails got like the little

1414
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:45,680
Um, pokemon on it. The pokemon's in her hair and we are just finishing off her legs and then we're done really

1415
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:48,560
I think she be actually might be alive

1416
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,280
Um, perfect timing

1417
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:54,320
Perfect timing if you ask me

1418
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,560
We're just gonna finish off her

1419
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:01,120
Leggies because she's wearing she's really repping belgium. She she just loves her home country

1420
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:06,080
Her catchphrase is male if you didn't know belgian people eat mayonnaise with chips

1421
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:12,640
Um, and she wants your mayonnaise for her chips wink wink, uh, and that is her that's her story

1422
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:18,160
Uh, she's sticking to it. She's not changing it, but she has a discord e can a discord

1423
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,200
E girl at the end of the day. So, uh

1424
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Do with that information what you will

1425
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:30,000
Sheepers is later tonight. Oh, no, I don't have anyone to read all right into

1426
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,640
And then we go yellow

1427
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,760
And then red and yellow

1428
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:45,360
Unfortunately, I didn't get much sleep. So I don't my brain's actually shutting down right now

1429
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:49,680
I can feel it. Um, I am gonna have a big sleep after stream, which I'm very happy about

1430
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:56,000
Because I've been needing it. Um, I do have an update for bleeding hearts. Your audio will come out

1431
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:01,840
When I wake up. It's already there. I just need to upload it. Um, it got edited

1432
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:08,800
Thankfully not by me. I didn't have to do it, but I do have to edit my reef link one. Why is one leg?

1433
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:12,800
Stalking getting longer than the other. What have I done here?

1434
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:19,120
Um, yes, so for any bleeding hearts when I wake up, I need to sleep. I know. Oh, it's so quick and

Um

1438
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:36,640
Yeah, you should redirect to strong here. She's doing a sleep stream

1439
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:42,080
Bruh, if I didn't fart, I'd be doing so many sleep streams. You'd be sick of me

1440
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,960
You'd honestly be sick of me

1441
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,800
I'd be snoring away

1442
02:05:53,440 --> 02:06:00,400
Oh, no, she's like a bumblebee now sweet little bumblebee. Oh math. Thank you for why is your picture the

1444
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:11,280
I really struggle with it that those word combinations

1445
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,880
Thank you math for the 10 gifted sub script

1446

Memberships congrats to those who caught it with your face. Um

1447
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:22,880
Why is your thing the Fibonacci sequence?

1448
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:26,080
I'm so curious

1449
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,320
No, we let do it braffin up his thorn

1450
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:34,480
That'd be real funny. Nice. Yes. We haven't heard. Oh my emotions are about to come

1451
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:40,160
I'm just waiting for them to actually send me the files now. Her toes are sadly going to be covered up

1452
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:42,400
It's a sacrifice. I'm willing to make okay

1453
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,360
Are you squinting me right now?

1454
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,720
Do do them. We don't mind the two. I am not

1455
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:54,560
I say that as if Amy didn't send me clips of her farting so we can turn them into shorts

1456
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:58,720
Honestly, it may is such a good sport. I was like explaining to the girls

1457
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:03,040
I was like if you have her fart on stream, please let me know so I can turn it into shorts

1458
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:06,320
Because it always gets popular for like no reason

1459
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,440
I get super popular

1460
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:16,560
So I'm literally sent away a highlight clip of me forcing out a fart. She was trying so hard. I was like, yeah, dang

1461
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:20,240
And then the toes are going to be red. Oh

1462
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,280
We did it

1463
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:26,000
Jane too has been confirmed

1464
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:33,040
Look at our little belgian discord kitten thing. Yay

1465
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:40,560
Fart a little golden ratio. Vendai, aren't true socks that show toes and the ball with the foot. That's just a zura

1466
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,760
Yui did it. Yeah, I suppose people find it even

1467
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,400
Fart is when you melt

1468
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,160
honestly

1469
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,320

Oh, we did we give kids discord kitten a name?

1477
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:27,440
Maybe we'll just call her kitten like spell it like that kitten kitten

1478
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:30,880
And then we've got slimy slimy ghee

1479

02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:36,720
I think I mean she's shutting down. I'm shutting down

1481
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:41,840
I mean, it's all right. Uh, I would probably be

1482
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,640
If I had to pick my favorite

1483
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:47,360
I actually like

1484
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,760
Who'd I like the most?

1485
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,080
Lower wise. I like the goblin

1486
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,360
Um

1487
02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:01,280
Design wise the most potentials probably uniology

1488
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,320
kitten kaboot

1489
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:10,240
Call the gen pintus because it was in gen two and chase honestly

Suicide freak score gen one a lure implies you have a choice

1491
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:20,400
Let's name a gen two oblige because you don't have a choice gen two freaky

02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:23,120
Personally attacked by the thumbnail

02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,200
Stop

1494
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,480
I'm freaking

02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:33,680
Look, I had to draw a slime girl and it accidentally makes jar jar binks as a freaking slime girl was terrible

1496
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,600
but this is

1497
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,600
This is gen two

1498
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:43,920
It's quite an interesting lineup. We've got going on after admit you would like the goblin. Yeah

1499
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,720
Maybe I would I made her myself

1500
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:50,960
The goblin's actually just me for real for real. Maybe remove the chest

1501
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:53,600
Everything else. Yeah, sure. I'll take it

1502
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:01,520
Wait if on the Belgian girl get her stockings warmer toes in their feet shape toes and have toes on

I'm sorry. She will never be slimed didn't the thumbnail say no slim girl jar jar slime basically

1505
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,800
Yes, the thumbnail said no slime girls. I was gonna get harassed. So we made one

1506
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:23,840
I made the ugliest slime girl imaginable. So you'll stop asking for a slime girl. We're not getting a slime girl

1507
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:29,600
The goblin is really good. Yeah, you like the concept of the goblin. Yeah

1508
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,360
Okay

Cuz I'm their mommy

1543
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:12,160
It's rather weird because I'm actually younger than a lot of them, but it's okay with me

1544
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:17,760
Because I love my daughter

1545
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,000

But it's a big old secret between two consenting adults

1563
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,600
There's my gen that's my gen

1564
