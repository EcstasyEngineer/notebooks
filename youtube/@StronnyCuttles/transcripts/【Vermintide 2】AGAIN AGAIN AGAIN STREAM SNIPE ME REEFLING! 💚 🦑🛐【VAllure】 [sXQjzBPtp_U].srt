1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She starts singing actually, because I've got a minute to myself without any singing.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, then try to get Amy's music video made.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, I'm just checking the last freaking donation, like the tip that's registered on stream

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
elements.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,600
Anonymous says, after donating all the money I have to you girls, I'll be bankrupt but

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,720
it'll be worth it to see you all smile.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,720
No anon, that's not how it works, bend over, BUNK, BUNK, BUNK.

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

9
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:22,720
In the month of August, that's right, we're streamed, so now it's my favourite kind of thing.

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,720
And yes, it's four o'clock in the morning for me, I'm in Australia.

11
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
I've got my thumb open.

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,720
That's right, right, hold on, let me pin, I need to pin it.

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,720
So I'm collabing with an ace marker called Yui, she's the one that was like, oh it doesn't

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
take the wheel.

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,720
I told her, the reeflings and I are going to be working together on the script together.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,720
She's like, I trust you and the reeflings, I trust you, are the reeflings to be trusted?

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,720
No, no, I like being a control freak.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
She's like, I feel bad you're doing all the work.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,720
I'm like, no, no, I like being a control freak with it because it makes it so much easier.

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,720
I'm just giving away all the secrets.

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Reeflings are to be trusted with my life.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
I love them.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Just to reassure.

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,720
A hell no, what are you to trust?

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Wait, Stronny's on the train?

26
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Hell yeah, I'm on the train.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Right, I first open up YouTube, geez, I'm having a stroke.

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,720
I don't think I can, well, there's a good time to shoot.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm going to say that people forgot that.

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Also, thank you to everyone who's been clipping me.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,720
I sent away like seven clips to be made yesterday with another editor.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Arissa's still going to be my main editor, but...

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I don't know how are you, I'm good, I got six hours of sleep.

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Someone commented on my newest short and it's just my hips and they're called a gossling.

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
That's so cute.

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,720
It's just my, but it's like my bikini hips, you know what I'm saying?

37
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Sorry, I'm just approving all of the wee comments that I got.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I'll approve the comments after stream, sorry I'm getting distracted.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,720
But we have a whole day we get to spend together.

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,720
I'm so fucking hate.

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
I love stream sniping.

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,720
I love playing with the replays.

43
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I don't know how other people can fucking hold them back.

44
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I get feral.

45
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
I'm like, yes, yes, connect to my IP.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Let me see your location.

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Anyway, I'm just a wee bit, a wee bit happy that we're playing again.

48
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Okay, I am called Shtironi Snipes.

49
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
This is the steam account.

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
That little question.

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Oh wait, I didn't even put anything with that.

52
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Hold on.

53
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Theme account to add to join.

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
And then it's the mommy wants to dox me.

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,720
No, well, if I want to dox you to myself so I can come and...

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
That's right.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Get vermin tight.

59
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
That's not how that works.

60
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Okay, there you go.

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I do have me piece of paper to write down all of your adorable name.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Checkmate you.

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Have we joined last time?

64
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Should we hold off?

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
No.

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
So this is a clean slate.

67
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Today is a clean slate.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,720
It does not matter if you were in the first lobby, the last lobby, the Elemino P lobby,

69
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,720
the HIJK Elemino here.

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,720
When it's a new day, it's a new stream sniping.

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
It doesn't matter what time you came in.

72
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
I will acknowledge it's not the weekend.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:42,720
We, we, we will do stream sniping days on week, days because, because, because, because...

74
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Oh, God.

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I forgot how to add.

76
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Oh, scroll down bitch.

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Scroll down.

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
We will do it.

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,720
But I will aim for the majority of the...

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Oh, God, how did I...

81
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Wait, why can't I hear any game sound?

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Is it me?

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Am I the problem?

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Wait, start game.

85
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Play reverses again.

86
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Huh?

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Is this right?

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Or have I fucked up?

89
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I don't remember the cinematic.

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Am I gone mad?

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
You can...

92
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Is she men?

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Oh, oh my God.

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
She's men.

95
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Oh, men.

96
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Get that woman some lithium.

97
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Is she dead?

98
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Sorry, I don't remember seeing the cinematic.

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
You're, you're being forced to watch it with me.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I do not recall.

101
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:13,720
The necromancer is her twin sister.

102
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Oh.

103
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Oh.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Oh?

105
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Harry Potter.

106
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
The boy who left.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Come to die.

108
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Is that why she always gets so close to death when she...

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Oh.

110
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Oh, is advertising the DLC to me?

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Wait, no.

112
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Did I just get advertised to be a cinematic?

113
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Did I just fall for advertising?

114
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I can't believe it.

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I just fell for fucking advertising.

116
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
What's this?

117
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Ranged headshots?

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
No.

119
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Aura that reduces damage.

120
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Marcus charges forward, you know.

121
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
I like, I like playing the default.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Sorry, I like him.

123
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,720
You just advertised to all of us.

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm so sorry.

125
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I fell for it.

126
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I fell for it.

127
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Look at her.

130
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I suck.

131
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
I suck.

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Now, there isn't ooh, ooh.

133
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I'm rolling.

134
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm breaking free.

135
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
74.

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Get every default.

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Yeah, I find him just the easiest to play.

138
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,720
How do I change my answer to it?

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh.

140
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Doesn't play game for one week.

141
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Instantly forgets how to do anything.

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Like, instantly I want to do a claim.

143
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't know what I'm claiming.

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Five shillings.

145
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm not going to be on it.

146
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I like, they kind of outdid those like, I don't know,

147
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
70 years ago or something in the UK.

148
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Maybe even longer.

149
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
A shilling.

150
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,720
How do I change my mode out?

151
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Is it hero selection?

152
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
No.

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Inventory.

154
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah, okay.

155
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Inventory.

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Wait, that one's...

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Why is it...

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Heroic assisting an ally under attack resource 15 temporary health

159
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,720
from both players?

160
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
That's like...

161
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Wait, so if a...

162
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Oh god, I got an achievement.

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Equipped an exotic item.

164
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
What makes it so exotic?

165
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,720
I don't know how that would make it exotic, but sure, sure.

166
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Hi, we're friends.

Are we doing team names, so?

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I don't know if we're still doing team names.

173
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Okay.

251
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,520
I didn't realize how much we expanded the last time I was here you know it's

252

257
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:11,960
way to go I'm an idiot okay right is it this I'm following them I don't know

258
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,200
where I've never played these levels so I know we've triggered a new one of them

259
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,000
and but yes they don't really have much fun behind the scenes stuff I kind of

260
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,400
boring stuff and we're preparing to get the audio manager and and then that

261
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:42,720
means I have no response to the tea and then I can focus on my reading and then

262
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,320
we can have content like all the time not that like I know I said I know it

263
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,720
might be like what do you mean like more content but I mean

264
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:03,880
I'm literally hazed by it there's so much reforming and I know like already

265
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,360
stream every single day but like it just means after a stream if I'm not like

266
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:17,160
recording anything or doing anything like I can actually like de-stress and

267
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,000
unwind type things so yeah you can help ink everywhere yeah more strong attack

268
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,200
basically yes it means like I can also and focus on like other things like for

269
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:40,200
example my donut on I need to rewrite the entire fucking thing sorry about em like

270
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,160
I literally need to rewrite the whole damn thing again and it's like these

271
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,600
small like little tasks that take time it's not going to be like stressful and

272
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,760
I'm trying to like fit it all in one thing and one go or anything like that

273
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,800
and it's like no I can like take my time and chill and I think we'll probably do

00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,560
another review stream of it I'll be in passing though like I'll just be a

275

00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,580
Some people would claim

490
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,300
That the Tiberian fox

491
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,420
Looks like it was drawn from memory

492
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,580
Without knowing what fox really looks like and some would argue that it's cute and that's okay

493
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,900
We have to celebrate our differences

494
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,340
That's thank you

495
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,980
Um, okay. I open box

496
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,460
And then I'll name the team and then we will mission select

497
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Well

498
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,020
I've got an arrow. I don't really use an arrow

499
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,860
It looks Tai betan it is Tai betan

500
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
Um, what are you?

501
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:05,500
Damage resistance versus rats is way up. Oh, I thought I knew gun that can actually put on. What the fuck is that?

502
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,060
Is that a weapon? No, you're fucking with me. That's not a weapon

503
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:18,380
What are you? Oh, I literally thought that was a weapon. I was like you're fucking with me refill and there's no way that's a weapon in game

504
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,300
Okay, we've got 80 on now

505
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,260
Let's really get in trouble

506
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
This does more damage

507
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,500
Wait, what?

508
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,220
Assisting an ally under attack restores 15 temporary health

509
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,740
I don't know. I feel like that's more advantageous than the team

510
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:46,060
Oh, that's we there and then the trinkets the same. Okay. Let me go mission select and then I will name our team

511
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,140
Which will be

512
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,700
Wait, what?

513
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,420
No, yeah, I don't know how I messed up

514
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,660
Ah, okay blood in the darkness

515
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:13,020
Blood right. Okay. The game reads out. Yes. We're playing. No. I'm yes. We're doing legendary mode. How do you?

516
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,900
I was gonna say yes or no

517
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,900
Oh, you have a piglet. Oh, wait. No, that's not a refill. That's an NPC. Um, right

518
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,620
What should the name be?

519
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,820
I do a combination legendary modes

520
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,340
Well, I call us legs and dairy because we're obviously

521
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,340
Should I call us cheese? I'm gonna call us cheese

522
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,140
Because we're cheese in the level because we're supposed to be playing legendary

523
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:48,460
But we're not and legendary sounds like dairy and dairy and cheese is a dairy product

524
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,660
Get a cheese. Cheese gang. Cheese gang. I'll call us cheese gang

525
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,300
Just call every team a different type of cheese grommets

526
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,620
Enter the outer bastard should have picked bastard

527
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,820
Should have picked any kind of support. We ended up green and

528
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,460
Green

529
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,820
Just call him team stinky

530
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,340
No

531
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
refunds aren't stinky

532
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,220
I I am the one who pheromone max is instead of I am the one who knocks

533
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,180
I'm the one who pheromone max is

534
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,180
I

535
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:48,620
Let's go find your way to the get out all

536
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,260
The gaoui what is the gaoui? I don't know

537
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,620
I'm learning. I'm learning

538
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,260
Nope, what?

539
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,740
I'm interested if necessary here

540
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,180
Oh my goodness, I'm gonna get turned around so much praying one of the refunds applied this before

541
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,980
Oh

542
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,460
My gosh places massive

543
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,660
I got

544
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,740
I like sniping a game I find it satisfying

545
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:45,500
There's that sniper game that I want to play with you guys because uh, I can't remember what it's called drop

546
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:52,860
It was like a really critically clean like everyone enjoyed it thoroughly and it was a sniper game

547
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,020
Sniper elite and maybe

548
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,420
And maybe

549
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,260
I'm not sure strongy indeed snakes. I am the one who snakes

550
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,300
I am the one who don't

551
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,100
I'm the one who come well not recently because I'm stressed again

552
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,740
I can't I I don't ink anymore. I've lost my belly to ink again

553
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,820
Not looking good

554
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
Oh, I told him

555
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,420
I found a book

556
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,420
Yeah

557
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:42,700
Literally, I live vicariously through you. I like read my marshmallows and I'm like, oh, yeah. Oh, that's given me life. Oh, yeah

558
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,060
I actually just put that keg open I'm sorry

559
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,780
Oh, well, who did that? Who hit that keg? Honestly

560
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,580
Who did that shorten behavior?

561
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Whoopsie

562
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,300
That's a good Darren. Whoa. Oh jeez

563
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,220
Let's wait up

564
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,380
We're waiting

565
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,100
How are you there? Did you just drop down?

566
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:42,780
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I'm not smart reflin. Please help me. I'm sorry. Thank you

567
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,220
How are you standing there like this way?

568
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,140
You gotta wrap around or wrap around

569
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,180
I'm following give me

570
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,060
Oh

571
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,660
My villain arc

572
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,340
ah

573
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,820
So my little my little shortcut wasn't quite it wasn't wrong

574
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:11,980
It wasn't quite right. Okay. Sometimes in life you can you can be right and wrong

575
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,420
Oh, there's a kid it's on fire

576
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,660
Ah

577
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,740
Wow

578
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,900
Oh my god, that gun is crazy

579
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,220
Aren't these called stalagmites

580
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,540
And then if it's on the ceiling it's called something else

581
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,500
But it sounds really similar to each other if it's on the roof and it's on the bottom

582
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,740
Whoa

583
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,620
There's titties on the ceiling

584
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,340
I

585
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,700
Don't my future remodel maybe didn't translate all that well. I'll extreme for the joke

586
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,460
Stalagmate standing

587
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:39,020
Stalag kiddies clinging to the ceiling. I mean, who wouldn't want to look up if he wouldn't

588
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,780
A troll troll in the dungeon

589
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,020
Oh

590
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:04,460
Is this the time really I'm swinging and whoo I found it. I found it. It's here

591
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:11,740
Uh, well, it's gone away again. He ran away. I promise. I'm not losing it. I literally saw it. I literally saw it

592
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,820
Oh you go you go I'm highlighted

593
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,820
Oh

594
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,540
Refling please be careful

595
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,700
I should be careful. No, don't take the book out. Ah

596
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,620
I'm stuck. I'm cornered. I'm cornered

597
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,980
Hey, what I'm stuck. I'm stuck

598
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,180
Troll stuck troll stuck

599
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,460
Oh, oh, get me out of there. Jeez

600
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,780
You're freaking stuck. Oh wait my layout is covering my health. How do I cover?

601
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,660
Is it this one?

602
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:51,660
I did it right on the first try. I'm so smart. There you go. Now you can see what I'm looking at

603
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,580
I have a control

604
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
I literally got

605
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:09,340
Spewed on wow. He has good aim. It's almost like he's here

606
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,340
Oh

607
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,580
It's tip his there. I'm stuck

608
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,620
Grip up grip on me after

609
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,060
We're grouping we're grouping

610
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,820
We're grouping we're grouping

611
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,820
We're grouping so hard right now

612
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,820
Oh

613
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,940
We're doing it we're doing it

614
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,100
This is

615
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,580
I'll actually after this one. I'll count how many missions there are left

616
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:08,300
Because I really don't think it's that many like I think after the act one

617
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,100
aim

618
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:18,700
Do not relent on your slay slay

619
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,180
Okay, I think that now that the gates open escape run run refling

620
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,220
We must flourish to the cast in

621
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,780
Oh, I know we're in the castle now. We must be

622
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,700
There's some in

623
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,500
Okay

624
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,980
Okay, okay, okay, let me get up. Let me get up. I don't know what I'm doing

625
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:58,860
Oh, wrong way. There was a staircase to the right. There was a staircase to the right to the right to the right to the right

626
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,220
Up the stairs up the stairs

627
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,320
Nice try nice try don't waste my time

628
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,140
I didn't know they had crawlers in this game

629
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,700
That's right. The one thing that is you know for

630
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,420
Automatically I need help

631
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,460
Is it going for a boost?

632
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,980
What are you doing? I'm going for whoop

633
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,100
What were they doing to these bodies?

634
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,500
They do not care

635
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:52,380
Oh no refling I'm not there to help

636
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,980

Oh, we can do like a 360 run

639
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,100
Okay, we have grimoire

640
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,660
Hey, I heard that there's something ahead careful. Oh, are these guys?

641
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,460
That sounded a lot more dangerous. Oh, it's him

642
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:39,500
Ah, I did it. I blocked I did it. Are you proud of me? I blocked in time in the face

643
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:44,220
Reach the surface. Yes, we can reach the surface. No problemo

644
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,180
Ah, I'm so proud of myself

645
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,420
I blocked the enemy and to aim

646
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,220
An MLG

647
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:05,420
Uh, does anyone need healing the elf needs healing elf you need to heal in the most

648
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,780
Where is elf

649
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,340
There's elf elf heal elf heal now

650
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,740
I'm ready. I'm defending right, let's go

651
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,900
This is worse than the smell

652
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:34,940
I could make the most vile joke right now, but I just want you to know that I'm referring raining

653
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,740
Is it down or up? Oh, no, it says reach the surface up up go up

654
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,820
I'm lurking to say proud of you blocking. Thank you

655
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,380
Shawnee has a filler

656
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,940
I've already forgotten what the elf said should it taste work

657
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,060
It tastes worse than it smells or something like that

658
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:04,380
And it was like reefing after realizing that pheromone maxing doesn't mean I taste better. I taste worse

659
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:10,300
Like I'm sure there's like a grosser way. I could have said that but I forgot already

660
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:18,460
And it was really obvious, okay, there's a boot buy a sigma

661
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:27,180
Wait, did they just not go for the captives or are they just like pretending like

662
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,140
Whoa

663
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,220
What a strange

664
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,900
You get

665
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:42,620
Hey some will taste okay. I think mold you think I got mold on me

666
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,500
Oh, no, no, no, did you save them?

667
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,700
Central

668
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,940
It is a book here. I'm full so I can't pick it up

669
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:03,900
It's just marionade little marionade never hurt and it adds flavor

670
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,580
He

671
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:15,020
Penicillin comes from all the guys. Oh, we should do a pen. We should do the wonders of modern medicine stream

672
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,420
And then I can talk about how penicillin came from a tweet

673
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,620
and then the rise of

674
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,420
antibiotic resistant

675
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,780
bacteria, which is naughty

676
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:33,580
Because viruses don't respond to antibiotic

677
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:39,020
And if you don't finish the course either you just are infected with

678
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,980
more

679
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,900
It's actually

680
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,780
Oh sweet man-made horror beyond my comprehension

681
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,540
It's not really it's by accident

682
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,100
and

683
01:08:53,100 --> 01:09:01,260
But like I don't know if it's in a same four different areas, but in Britain. Um antibiotics are

684
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,340
Regulated like you have to go to the doctor to get them

685
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:13,420
Um, and they won't grant you them if you present with symptoms of like viruses or whatever

686
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:21,180
Um, you have to like prove basically that you've got like a bacteria issue going on because that's what the antibiotics are

687
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,020
anti-bacterial

688
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,020
anti-biotics

689
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,380
And bacteria is alive whereas viruses aren't alive

690
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,140
and

691
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,420
viruses are like

692
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,580
When you have a cough and it's sneezing stuff

693
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,380
and oh no

694
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:42,380
Hey disconnected wait someone just wait am I going no wait idiot idiot

695
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:47,100
That's I'm an idiot. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. I'm dumb

696
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,580
I

697
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,140
Thought there was a decent

698
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,780
Where was that?

699
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,140
I lost you're free

700
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,500
Yeah, we have a ball. Oh no, what's happened?

701
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,860
What happened how did I only just notice the snow?

702
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:20,780
That makes sense because over use of antibiotic can be more. Yeah

703
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,780
Can I invite you back in oh, that's a human sorry

704
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,780
I

705
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,700
See me can join a game in progress another book is here

706
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,020
The knee it convinced the bot to pick it up

707
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:58,140
I disconnected yeah, I don't know if you got the invite to try and come back in

708
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Hmm

709
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,620
Oh wait the bot knows how to pick up boots

710
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,020
No way you got that kill you stole it if you order them to oh, it's working

711
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,240
Wait, you can't come in even though I'm invited

712
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,980
Oh

713
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:37,420
I see you. Whoa. No, I broke the door. I was gonna close in their faces

714
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,180
The bot's have smart pain

715
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,220
What we supposed to do down here we're supposed to come here there come here there

716
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,540
All heroes must be in this area. Yes

717
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,900
Oh, we're searching

718
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,540
Point to a book and press tango

719
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,700
I'm hacking you flashy flashy flashy

720
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:22,060
No, uh, I Rissa actually sent me a new short to upload

721
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:28,380
I'm sorry. You can't fool me. I know you will taste amazing after some pheromone maxing

722
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,340
No, that is not how

723
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:36,860
How choochies work. Thank you giving kitsune, but replaying

724
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:44,860
The the choochie is an enclosed system. Okay, everything has to expel from it. Okay

725
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,820
So pheromone maxing. Uh, uh, I snuck and taste it. Am I not supposed to?

726
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,300
I'm uh, I'm holding us up. Thanks

727
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:58,140
No, don't be putting the lick in them. Oh, it's bad

728
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:14,780
I hear them like really badly hear them

729
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:22,220
Last book is coming up and we had to do in the hard mode

730
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,380
A closed ecosystem indeed. No

731
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:35,260
Like I was memeing the other day, but you I think you can technically make bread with your own

732
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:43,660
Your own supply, you know, they normally say don't get high on your own supply, but

733
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,500
Uh

734
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:53,260
Yeah, uh, can any of us pick it up?

735
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,580
All right, I'm gimme gonna pick it up

736
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,980
Bread, beer, it's all yeast

737
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:09,340
They say the stink of the cheese the better it tastes so maybe the same goes

738
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,340
No

739
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,340
Drinking karma, no

740
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,780
That's terrible

741
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:26,220
Thank you for the the tip, but no, am I going the wrong way? Am I not supposed to go this way?

742
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,100
or

743
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,420
He just did a funny roundabout

744
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:37,500
You expel it and we swallow it beeflings you did not take nutrition from that

745
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:43,260
I don't care if you're I say full of oh no, you might because you're a deep sea life form and they take

746
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,820
Nutrients from anything

747
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,500
Thank you

748
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,620
You're

749
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:49,980
Ramin

750
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:54,060
Gramin for becoming a member. That's right. I said that right. I said it's so right. Hmm

751
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,860
Gramin's all over you

752
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,860
Okay, I'm gonna heal

753
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,860
And then I'm gonna pick up the boots

754
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,980
Got it

755
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,980
Hey, we're accurate. Hello potential. No

756
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:20,860
Hey, if we can eat century eggs, why not? I heard about that

757
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,180
Ritual chamber

758
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,460
Oh, I didn't pick the book up. Oh, no

759
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:40,860
No, wait, what wait what happened? Wait, I'm confused. I don't have wait

760
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,180
Did that reflin take the book off of me?

761
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,100
I'm back

762
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,700
Am I going mental?

763
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,580
The reason pick up oh

764
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,900
Oh

765
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,300
Whoops

766
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:14,540
Survive right we're gripped up. We're safe. Although I think you need this more than I do

767
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,380
I shouldn't be gonna work

768
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,700
Uh, uh

769
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,340
Uh, I'm getting killed

770
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,020
I'm I'm helping. I'm totally helping right now. I'm helping so much

771
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,340
Truly

772
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,300
Look at that one kill one kill. I'm helping my teammate

773
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:54,940
If you need an example of what pheromone maxxing looks like take one look at the place

774
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,300
Honestly real unsure I had to shower yesterday

775
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,980
Because I did a big massive poopy

776
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,820
And I was like damn I need to show up to that

777
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,380
And you don't tell him the truth because I'm laughing

778
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:23,660
I really want a Japanese toilet like that comes with this the day things and like it plays like music for you and everything

779
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,180
And

780
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,940
Oh, I can't see that enemy. I have no idea where that enemy that's from that

781
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:34,620
At least the bread came out fine

782
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:42,780
That's what if I go for a walk and all that I refland ink everywhere

783
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,780
Carve them up smash them in back into the ink I go

784
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:57,180
Shawnee shivered she hates this I do not I do not I assure you

785
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,500
I

786
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,820
The one that pressure washes your crack

787
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:08,780
I so badly want a Japanese toilet like the lid opens up apparently it comes with a seat warmer

788
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:11,660
That's luxury. You know that's like

789
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:18,220
If I ever became a millionaire there would be signs and I would be showing off my Japanese toilet

790
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,260
I've been so freaking happy in that thing. Why?

791
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,300
How's any bombs?

792
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,020
Please

793
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:33,420
Please please drop the refling. We don't have heels. Oh good. No

794
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,500
Oh, she's sorry. You scared me

795
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,860
It please

796
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,300
Since when there was a plea I'm not I'm not kidding

797
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:50,140
There's genuinely the Japanese toilets like plea music to hate your your tinkle sounds and stuff

798
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:57,420
And it also like can beat when it welcomes you like it senses when you enter and it'll open up

799
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,140
And you can like set the seat to warm when it's winter

800
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:04,620
So your butt's all nice and warm and you have to wake up and take a tinkle in the middle of the night

801
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,940
Because you drank too much

802
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,660
Oh, we did it. No way we did that. We have all books

803
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,380
All books and two totems

804
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,020
mlg

805
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:22,700
I'm almost shiny. So cute. Hope you get one. Yeah, like look, I'm not here looking for a Lamborghini

806
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:29,420
I'm not here looking for a y'all. I'm not here looking for this. You know what? I want a humble Japanese toilet. That's what I want

807
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,940
That's all that's what I crave in life

808
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:37,580
All Japanese, but I actually don't even know how to get one, but you never know

809
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,380
The art and take of the shitter truly the best

810
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:50,460
It well, I used to really annoy my mum and I used to run the water like the tap every time I took a shit

811
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,420
I don't know why I used to be so embarrassed about the sound of it. So I used to run the tap

812
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,820
So now I'm used to hearing running sounds

813
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:06,220
I work in a Japanese restaurant and we had two B days, but one already broke in less than a year

814
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,940
Can't do good things in America. Oh

815
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:15,900
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Also. Thank you quest as well for the super chat

816
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:22,300
So I have been absolutely not on point with being like following the rules of being strummer

817
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,700
I've been doing shit

818
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,820
Um, absolutely terrible

819
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,340
Absolutely terrible. All right. I got completely carried. What did I do damage to monsters?

820
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,220
How?

821
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:39,120
Because I got pinned in the corner

822
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,540
Because I got pinned in the corner

823
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,660
I'm getting out. I'm getting rewarded with that shopping

824
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,760
Oh a hydration check I need water

825
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,760
I

826
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,120
Battered the trolls head as it pinned me to the wall like fucking

827
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:16,080

Then resurrect wait, what was it? What the fuck did I call you first dead then resurrect? Gosh. Um

838
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,280

Right, what's in it? Okay an energy freezes. Oh baby a triple

01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:26,640
But we've got someone called zero so what oh baby a zero kill because it says first dead and dead means killed so

841
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Okay, this group is oh baby

842
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,280
A zero kill. What a unique name for a team

843
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:45,680
I'm sorry if I sound tired. I'm struggling to wake up. I've had a tea. I've had sugar

844
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,360
And my arse isn't awake yet. What you mean? Okay

845
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:57,760
The in canter's lair so that we're about to finish that one that one only has two this one has four so at least there's

846
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,680
Sam can tense juice

847
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,200
Wait, so you bought the dlc. I can't believe it

848
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,600
They tricked you they advertised to you so well

849
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,640
First zero for turning

850
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,600
One will grow to be to verment I can be pretty tired

851
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,080
Clap it so it wakes up. You want me to clap my cheek?

852
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,560
Want us to wake your arse

853
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:38,560
Since you mentioned sound about plain overwatch when the new Juno Juno is out. I just want to let you know wait Juno's out right now

854
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:48,880
Haha, what if I made us all install even more spyware and we play a little of overwatch together

855
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:00,000
Wait, you want me to get up and clap right now. I don't even know if I could do it. Hold on. Hold on. I need I've got

856
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,120
I've got

857
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:14,000
Oh, no, it's not working. Wait, hold on. It's in my head. It's because I've got a big video on hold on. Hold on

858
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,040
Like I'm good at performing

859
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
I'm good at performing under

860
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,120
I still got it, baby

861
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,240
Okay, I stood up. Surely this will get the blood pool and wake me up and not keep me asleep

862
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,040
Oh

863
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,400
Oh my god, wait, maybe we should do that after overwatch if we win again

864
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,000
Uh

865
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
If we win an overwatch

866
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:50,240
I do a round of applause after every time we win, but if we don't win you get spit in your mouth instead

867
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,200
How about that that's how we'll do overwatch

868
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:00,560
So if we lose you have to open your mouth and let me spit in it and if we win I give you a round of applause

869
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,640
No, they can't get past the guards because of those

870
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
This one is the um

871
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,960
Where's the punishment? It sounds like a win-win to me installing overwatch right now

872
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,840
Oh, look at that pause

873
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,440
Centurion hit. Oh heads with a sigma. What was that once again?

874
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,560
No, I've just fucking taped that and don't read the don't read the chat and game. I've just messed up again

875
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,200
His mummy finally learned to block sometimes

876
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
but he lowered sometimes

877
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,760
No, not again

878
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,880
I do it every time in this game. I don't know how

879
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:48,880
Um, but I didn't realize Juno was out. I thought she was like still a month away

880
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,720
We made it to the castle

881
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
Oh

882
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,360
Not posing at the door like yeah, this is the way I'm yeah use the omelot wheel

883
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,840
I have entered the castello

884
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:17,040
Uh, they really didn't want to spruce up the place did they poison feast chalice. Why not?

885
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:27,040
Poison feast chalice, uh, I'm not really sure I like the decor. You need to make this place a bit more inviting, don't you think?

886
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,960
See, what does that say? See if anyone answered

887
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,040
Oh

888
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
Oh, but I actually scared me

889
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,200
I was gonna pretend to push the door open a bit faster. That actually scared me

890
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,080
What a baby honestly

891
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,520
Baby

892
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,880
Is it over which one or two I have terrible news for you refling

893
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,920
They killed overwatch one

894
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,680
To make two they like merged to the server and pretended that overwatch two is like a new game

895
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,840
It it wasn't the overwatch two is literally just

896
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,560
They just added like battle pass and stuff into

897
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,120
I'm sorry. You had to find out this way

898
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,840
My thoughts are with you at a time like this. I I'm sorry. It's just how it is

899
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,720
They

900
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,320
Overwatch one doesn't exist

901
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,720
There is no easter bunny. There is no toast fairy and there never was an overwatch two

902
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,440
It's just a package

903
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,560
Coblet

904
01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:01,520
Okay, so the reason why you always swing in this game is because an enemy might pop out and you'll do damage at any point

905
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
But if you don't

906
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,640
Swing you're never going to do the damage

907
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,240
Find a way back to the castle. Oh, because we're in the crypt

908
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,160
What was that I found it

909
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:24,560
Um, is this a dead end I'm following you. Okay. I think none of us have played this map. Okay. I'm following you guys

910
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,720
Right, let's go back down here

911
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,600
Whoa, I actually got wallet

912
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,560
Oh, wait, no, there's something here. Hold on a minute. Oh, no, you're friendly

913
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,480
Uh

914
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,920
I assumed her to go up

915
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,640
Oh, oh no, we've reached the bone warrens. Oh, no, no, we're not going that way

916
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:59,360
Truly your friends, do you think keeping them alive makes up for all the rooms you've failed?

917
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,360
Why we got brain worms in this game?

918
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,120
And not this game having in-game brain worms. What the heck?

919
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:21,040
Become debuff find a way I'm finding a way at Drayshman's vaults

920
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Come on

921
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
I'm spamming I'm spamming

922
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:39,920
No straggler straggler no struggling. No replay. Are you okay?

923
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,680
I like that the rats can talk

924
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,960
I

925
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,040
When you feels you're no match for queens with fire

926
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,600
Wait till she finds the

927
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,000
psychers in dark tide are completely mad

928
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:13,200
Well, like psychic people are just straight up mad and no one believes them or is psychers something

929
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,920
Mm-hmm

930
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,480
Hold on I give my a little itch itch out. Sorry. I was itching my hair

931
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,600
Oh

932
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:42,320
Wait, so does everyone get like a specific thing mad as info balloon skit's trying it. Well

933
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,640
Um, we're doing it. We're doing it. Yeah, fuck that door. Fuck it up

934
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,240
Perish that door. Okay, there's heel. Oh chalice. Hello

935
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,560
I got five chalice

936
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,440
They draw in power from

937
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,480
Yeah

938
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,720
God this gun is OP

939
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,800
Do we jump down? Is this third to the halls grand feast hall? Okay. Yes. We are

940
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,720
It's mine now. Fuck you

941
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:30,640
Oh, let's blow it to smithereens. Where's the keg? Oh, you already got it. Wait

942
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,400
Oh, oh

943
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
Is there a secret chalice in this room?

944
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,120
Oh, they're exploding out the hall

945
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,080
How undesirable

946
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,480
Yeah, the voices and the head change based on I was gonna say because it doesn't make sense for

947
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,480
The guys would be going at me like, oh, how many fuck are you?

948
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,920
trained

949
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,080
Of carillions like what you own a bit

950
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,920
Oh dad like my coffers being full

951
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,640
You

952
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,240
Wait, am I the only one that hears it? Why did she I say are you all right?

953
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,920
Am I deathwind?

954
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,960
Or does she not hear she's already mental

955
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:35,200
Kind of wait were you posing on the stairs?

956
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,240
Stop, how do you do that so quickly?

957
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,240
I don't know how you do that. You must have changed. Stop in the middle of a fight

958
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,560
Okay, I'll beat him up beat him up beat him up

959
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:59,040
Maybe she's not weird. She's being corrupted by chaos. She can't stop herself

960
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:04,560
I was somewhat annoying since warhammer fans in fortcare both within the universe but far away from each other

961
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,440
Yet chaos gods have always been there but also haven't been there

962
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,280
They're just feeling a bit quirky, you know I hear

963
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,640
Oh

964
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,160
I'm coming. I'm coming. Give us a second. Give us a moment

965
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,120
I saved the replaying you're welcome

966
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,760
High five

967
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,720
You're to heal them. Yeah

968
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,040
Okay, we'll have an

969
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
They were a little corky

970
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,640
Ah, that's so blinding

971
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
I really can't even wake up

972
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
this morning

973
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,760
Am I dreading having to actually

974
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,080
I bet you that's what it is. I'm going out. I'm like, maybe not

975
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:09,200
Although I'll tell you something noody that I did yesterday instead of working full. I did um

976
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,640
I don't know if you guys watch Caleb hammer

977
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:19,280
It's like this guy that looks into people's finances and then he goes

978
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,720
You're voluntarily putting yourself in debt, right?

979
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:27,440
But he had an episode where he had this guy come on

980
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
But he was having a really difficult time

981
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,560
like with

982
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,080
I don't know

983
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,800
I don't know what the diagnosis is, but it's rough

984
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,880
How much t of you in jesset? Whoa. Whoa. What was I don't even know what that was

985
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,400
I think I thought grabbed by something and you saved me. Thank you refling. You're my only hero

986
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,960
Hey, will I ever repeat you? I must shag you as payment

987
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,160
Where did that go? I saw it

988
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:04,960
I'm going mental. I saw that. Did it do? Ah, there is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you coming on mail early

989
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:12,240
As a corner financial point, I love Caleb hammer's content

990
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,080
I just find it interesting to see how like other people live

991
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,720
um

992
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:21,600
Cuz I'm always going to eat shit

993
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,400
Bomba

994
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,240
Oh shit, you just pulled them up to smithereen

995
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,280
Um

996
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:43,360
Cuz uh, I'm very lucky to be in a position where um, I don't have a credit card and

997
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,360
Cuz I fucking

998
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:56,480
How can you be a king in this universe that doesn't make anything

999
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,200
Ah stop it

1000
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,440
This map is confusing no matter how many times I play it. No pressure. We're looking at you

1001
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,440
It looks like we're supposed to go there

1002
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,520
I'm on oh wait

1003
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,720
I don't know what to do

1004
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,120
credit cards are a scam basically

1005
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,760
Wow, that's so bright. Um

1006
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,080
Basically, yes

1007
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:34,480
But I understand obviously why people need them like but I just fucking hate them

1008
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:41,280
I like credit score as well. Sorry. I cannot help be tinfoil. I can I go one stream without being tinfoil?

1009
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,600
I'll go this way. Okay. We're t-posing over here

1010
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,160
If I could go one stream without being tinfoil that would be grand

1011
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,800
Ritualists are sent

1012
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,680
Never

1013
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,960
There's no pressure. Is that the pressure credit cards must be the most you spend without noticing how much you spend

1014
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,920
yes, so um

1015
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:12,000
If you had the physical money to see how much like you hand over etc

1016
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,760
I think a lot of people would be like absolutely mortified at how much they hand over for like certain things

1017
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,400
But it's all like

1018
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,680
the benefit of the credit card companies and all that like

1019
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:31,120
You know like back in the old day if you had literal like gold in that and you'd have to put it in storage like

1020
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:38,880
You know if people could see the vast amounts of physical wealth that others have like that's why the guillotine was a thing

1021
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,960
Yeah, no

1022
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,960
No, I'm not saying

1023
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,440
That that's the thing but what I'm saying is once money became

1024
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,160
Like numbers on a screen as it advanced with technology

1025
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,120
It it can hide

1026
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,680
wealth and it can also like it can hide wealth to be the at the advantage of

1027
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,760
um

1028
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,680
The high table basically

1029
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:13,200
But it can be such a disadvantage to the average joe because you don't realize like how much is coming out of your coffers type thing

1030
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,040
and um

1031
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,400
Honestly, there's probably a lot of like mentality about it as well

1032
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,920
Because if you had to like so say you get your paycheck and you took it all out in cash

1033
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,360
And then you handed your landlord the rent in cash

1034
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,800
And then you went to the shop and paid for everything in cash

1035
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:39,360
Um, and like you could see it go down so dramatically you'd be like what i'm not spending money on x y z elemental p

1036
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,080
um

1037
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,320
So yeah, sorry

1038
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:52,000
Sorry, I know I sound really the fact that i'm actually really tired right now and still i'm able to

1039
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,600
call

1040
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:58,160
Come like come out with a sentence around tin foil hat now

1041
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:04,640
I could just kind of help myself honestly canny just put me in the bin put me in the bin. I've uh, I don't know

1042
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,080
I need to learn to shop. So at some point I really do

1043
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,680
um

1044
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,520
I'm

1045
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:19,600
Whoa, where did you come from? Yeah, two of us can shield bash. I might not have a shield but i'm bashing anyway

1046
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,560
a chandelier

1047
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:28,320
Hmm, how curious we've been offered health potions right everyone heal up heal up over here

1048
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,320
They're not healing up fine. I'll heal up

1049
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,520
Stressing me out

1050
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,240
Boss fight upcoming

1051
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,480
Am I not cooking

1052
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,000
You're actually right money is actually just a number for actually

1053
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:54,480
Get ready for one of those boss fights of all time. Don't say that. Is that a werewolf? Please be a werewolf

1054
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa is this physical responsibility?

1055
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,400
uh

1056
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:09,600
Depends on what your situation is right that's it. I'm delving into the refueling bank account to make sure that uh

1057
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:15,120
You're self sustaining and you're not undead and then you're allowed to

1058
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,000
Then you're allowed to be the inquester of the werewolf. Thank you

1059
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,040
Bed of ear bed of ear

1060
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Bed of ear bed of ear

1061
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,520
I'm trying. I'm sure I'm saying it wrong

1062
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,120
Huh

1063
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
Huh

1064
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't just come from all directions

1065
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,040
Now hold on a minute

1066
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,240
Why

1067
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1068
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,640
Now hold on a minute. Excuse me sir

1069
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,680
Ah, what happened to my crosshair

1070
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:08,240
Oh, we're all through it. What is that me that's doing that? Am I messing this up?

1071
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,800
I'll be naughty

1072
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,800
I think I'm messing this up a wee bit, but I'm trying my best

1073
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,080
Is that do anything?

1074
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,640
It keeps making me look to the ground when he does that. Am I supposed to do something?

1075
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:36,240
I'm popping a drink. Sorry. I need a drink to comprehend what on earth I'm doing wrong

1076
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,200
Did I need to be in the circle?

1077
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,880
Stand out of the orange. Oh, you mean that super

1078
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,840
massive hint

1079
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:53,280
That's really obvious to most video gamers to not stand in and I keep standing in it. Oh

1080
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,440
Okay

1081
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,120
Thank you

1082
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,080
I don't know why it takes me so long to figure out mechanic

1083
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,800
I'm doing it

1084
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,440
Literally with

1085
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,840
Bios, wait, what stand out of the orange stand out of the orange

1086
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,000
I'm swinging. I'm swinging. I'm stunning. I'm stunning. I used my ultimate, but I don't know if that helped

1087
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:26,640
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm dodging. I'm dodging. I'm spanking. I'm spanking

1088
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,960
Oh

1089
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:57,360
Wakey wakey my pretty and be another 4am stream

1090
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:09,200
We're wrong. Sorry. That's the gate. Wait. These are all gate. It's a riddle. Oh, it's a lever. Sorry

1091
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,640
There is a lever on the wall

1092
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,120
Nicely done. We're getting through this castello is going down

1093
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,120
Oh

1094
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,720
Where the heck is the lever?

1095
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Oh

1096
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,920
It's not it's like a

1097
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,120
Okay, okay, we make it up. We make it up. We're doing it. We're doing it

1098
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,800
We're doing it

1099
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,440
Oh, it's art in here. Oh, it's so pretty

1100
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,160
That should not come into the cage

1101
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,400
I might as well. No mommy, please. My sleep. Literally

1102
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,720
Thank you, wakey. Time for another endurance stream at 4am

1103
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,960
Yeah, I'm really happy with how Slonic Heroes went yesterday. I was

1104
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:14,640
secretly actually really worried I wouldn't be able to do the end

1105
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:21,280
But like I was rolling and smoking that game. It's a child's game. No, stop. Stop. Don't ruin it for me

1106
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,760
I did really good. I never went against metal sonic before. I didn't even know it was a thing

1107
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,120
And then I rolled and smoked um, yes

1108
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:34,000
It took me a while to figure out that I can't hit them with the same color on the button on the side of the suit

1109
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,560
I'm

1110
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,520
I got a job interview

1111
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,200
What do you need to do? What do you need to do for a job interview?

1112
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:52,320
Basically fucking smoke up that. Oh, yes. I'm very self-sufficient. If you need a cv unironically

1113
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,520
Send I will pretend that you're on the dev team

1114
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,560
If you need a cv

1115
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:06,080
I'm gonna make a throwaway email and you guys can ask for cvs and I'll make up the most best bullshit ever

1116
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:12,880
So wake up. I'm a real gamer girl. Yeah, I'm not doing it for male attention for one

1117
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,840
Even though I'm getting completely carried through the game. Does that make me a real gamer?

1118
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,840
Merchant strong bot

1119
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,440
Headshots and special skills

1120
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:39,120
Still pre-recorded streams though. Strongly the ultimate job wingman

1121
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,600
For one exactly

1122
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,720
All for male attention caught me in 4k

1123
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:52,240
She said I do but we did it. Thank you team

1124
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,600
Uh, oh baby a zero kill. Who names these teams?

1125
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:03,520
Clearly they need to be kicked off of any development team that requires naming of any source

1126
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,400
Hmm. Hmm. Yes

1127
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:11,200
I can't wait. I can't wait to get obliterated

1128
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:16,720
But I already got obliterated for fondal abysm. So actually there's no there's no need right. I'm not open

1129
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
No

1130
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,400
You type fondal abysm in game chat. I was tazin

1131
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,760
Pre-recorded stream for the brats. I did it

1132
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,160
How's that for a I pre-recorded

1133
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,760
Hmm

1134
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,520
The strong e365 stop that's such a shite me

1135
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:45,360
Oh, I got an even better gun. I was a 10 out of 10 for you. Yeah. Yeah, you like that. That's pretty

1136
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,320
sugar

1137
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,680
Fucking actually look look. Okay. Let me make sure there's no other

1138
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:01,040
No, we got we've got quits in this team and then two more we flim if there's any available

1139
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:05,040
I know it's the week a weekday. So please don't worry if you can't join

1140
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,920
um

1141
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
94

1142
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,320
Wait, why's that?

1143
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,880
What do you do?

1144
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,880
I'm gonna just my hero power is almost 300 now

1145
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:23,200
Oh, it's so close to being 300 power

1146
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,960
Power from hero level 200 power from equipment 91

1147
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:32,640
effect damage dealt number of enemies penetrated by attack

1148
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:39,920
And stagger level hero power is defined by your hero level and the average value of your equipped gear

1149
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:48,560
Um strong e4 20 believes it. How do we join by the way? You just add me on theme

1150
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:53,120
And then you snipe into the lobby and then that's it

1151
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:57,840
Others are but empty reflections of his blood you invite yourself into the lobby

1152
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:03,360
Like you can join the lobby. You don't have pen in this pre-recorded brap clip

1153
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:11,280

Because if you're here then that kind of just proves you're a leaf

Like even if you're a vod watcher or you clip or you just like tweets in general. I'm not a fake reflin. I'm a freaklin

1262
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,040

01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:49,440
I'm gonna buy so I'm gonna buy the chicken and then when I finish the chicken, I'm gonna make soup

So basically once I've finished with the chicken

1289
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:08,000
I've put it um, I boil the bornstone for the base of the bra and it'll taste absolutely delicious

1290
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:16,640
And and then I'll show pictures of it because I'll be really proud of it and if I taste it and it's not nice. I'll be really sad

1291
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,360
Oh

I'm just never gonna stop making soup because it means I will be eating super duper healthy

1305
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:33,140
I'll get it. I'll be eating super healthy

02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:43,840
Brave goal and I'll post my soup on twitter because I don't normally like post personal

1317
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,720
Like shit I do after stream

1318
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:54,320
Like I don't want to spam the feed and I like what I like that the girls post a lot because they always post interesting stuff

1319
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,280
And we're like how they're doing or what's going on with them

1320
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,840
um

1321
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:05,200
And like I like using it to be like, oh mercy's ASMR roleplay like here's a teehee funny tip

1322
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,720
But if you want to listen to it like I actually cut my hair for it

1323
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:14,720
So, you know, you're welcome to listen like or like I'll on my alt account like I'll retweet everyone's butts

1324
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,880
Um

1325
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:24,080
The thing like I just like letting the girls do the the tweeter is like I just used to her for

1326
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,160
Checking all

1327
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:35,920
I just I don't really use it for much. I'm a simpleton

1328
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:48,640
Oh another okay, I like this mission. It feels very winter wonderland together

1329
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:50,640
Oh

1330
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,680
I'm getting yanked I'm getting yanked and there's an assassin on me too

1331
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:05,280
Teehee. I'm getting pulled out of bounds not to uh, not to stress any reefling out. I am

1332
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,840
Getting pulled through the map

1333
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,520
Oh

1334
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,680
That's right. I actually joined a bd call in with fiji. I made you

1335
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:45,600
Oh, I was feeling a bit quirky. Okay. I was feeling really really quirky

1336
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,760
I

1337
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,320
Falled from ruin

1338
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:56,400
I miss my shoulder reeflings the fiji take you made me. It was so cute. I bet you they were like, why are you strong?

1339
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:06,240
Brian write all my jokes down on paper because they're terrible. I'll see myself out

1340
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,360
Thank you pretty lord. It's not that bad

1341
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:13,360
Yeah, I didn't realize at first. They were like who is that

1342
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:19,280
No, it's not your fault reeflings. It's not your fault

1343
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,800
It's okay. It's not your fault

1344
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,720
It's okay

1345
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,800
It's not your fault

1346
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,800
So

1347
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:46,960
I literally write through the map as well

1348
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:54,160
You vomit

1349
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,400
Oh

1350
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:02,400
How can you rescue a corpse? I fell under the map. How can you rescue me? That doesn't make sense

1351
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,200
We don't mind you spam nerf either. Oh

1352
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:16,880
Is this the first time you've died on stream in this game? It was a glitch. Oh, I'm here. Wow. How did you do that?

1353
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:19,760

She's chopped liver and I'm back na na na na na na na down down

1365
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:26,400
I don't know the words. I just know the kind of tuning and what meant to do

1366
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,120
Um to take a cog

1367
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:34,240
Okay, there's a cog over here. I'm getting the cogs cogee cogee cogee

It's running in

1369
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:44,320
This looks like a job for me. So everybody

1370
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:51,040
Just follow me because we need a little controversy because it feels so empty without me

1371
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:54,720
And this looks like on top for me. So everybody

02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,360

1383
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:52,640
This looks like a job for me. So everybody just ink on me because we need a little controversy because if you're so

1384
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:54,880
Empty with that

1385
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:58,640
Start the rope way. Yes

1386
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,400
That can you pull that?

1387
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:06,640

02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,320
And they realize if there's a blight former

1389
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,680
Uh, right one parish

02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:24,240
Take this blunt damage. Jeez. Oops

1391
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:29,120
Nope, that's friendly. Nope, that's not friendly

1392
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,840
Nope, that's friendly. Oh, that's not I'm getting spanked about

1393
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:42,080
This feels so empty without ink on me

1394
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,040
No, no, no

1395
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:54,640
We should uh, I need to hurry up and come out with my parody songs. I wrote so many before debut and I've not done one singular one yet

1396
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:59,120
I usually come out and do it need some stalling

1397
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:03,360
Stop stalling and actually do work

1398
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:10,400
I've been sitting on two lovers for ages. I want to do a cover a Scottish cover of two lovers

1399
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,080
Two lovers forbidden. They want another

1400
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:32,720
And they're only wishes to be together

1401
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,200
I didn't realize I was gonna fall for what

1402
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,760
I didn't realize

1403
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:44,240
He's so on fire because you're feeling hot hot hot

1404
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:50,720
So anyway, all you do is work between your shuman sketch on your constant. Thank you guys. There's no stalling

1405
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,400

1406
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,320

1407
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,840
I mean

1408
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,720
Maybe ASMR halloween if you want like vampire

1409
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:05,920
And like ghost girl type halloween like ASMR roleplays

1410
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,720
We could do that

1411
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,280
Shawnee we're the two lovers

1412
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:15,760
Forbidden from one another

1413
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:19,760
Management debated our people

1414
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:25,920
Adam and a year of pregnancy stole us apart

1415
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:30,800
But then we could be together

1416
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,960
Secret don't know

1417
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,880
Ow

1418
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:47,280
Lyrics coming at you. It's super strong. Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I can't see the enemy. I literally cannot see the the witch

1419
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:50,160
I'm sorry beefling. I can't see him

1420
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,360
Where is he?

1421
02:10:55,680 --> 02:11:01,040
I can't he's coming for me. I literally can't see him in the winter wonderland for

1422
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:03,920
I don't know

1423
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:08,800
Vampires Shawnee is one way to get some iron. Oh, oh, that would make sense

1424
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:17,200
Oh, oh my god vampire girlfriend needs iron ASMR

1425
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:21,280
Oh, but youtube is youtube

1426
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:28,960
I'm not sure what's going on at youtube headquarters. Um, I saw three

1427
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:37,120
Channels either get a warning or video removed. Um, one had kissing in it. Oh, I've been gang. I've been ganged up on

1428
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,440
She stand up shape up

1429
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:48,800
Um, have I bit off more than I can chew?

1430
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:53,440
I think I bit off more than I can chew

1431
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:59,040
I'm biting off a lot more than I can chew right now, but that's okay

1432
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,200
surely

1433
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:04,000
Whoa, that wasn't me. Who the hey, what?

1434
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,760
I assure you that was not me

1435
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:10,560
Have I gone the completely wrong way? I think I have

1436
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:19,440
I've gone completely wrong way. Hold on reeflings. I'm coming to join the party. I'm sorry. I went on a quest

1437
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:22,080
I

1438
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:29,440
What do the youtube overlords have against these one it's just really frustrating because they've not come out

1439
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,080
Wait, how are you there? What?

1440
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:35,200
It's just frustrating because I've not come out and been like, yes, we have changed the policy

1441
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,800
This is not allowed now

1442
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,000
Instead, it's just like no

1443
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,560
We're just going to give everyone warnings and bans and timeouts and xyz lmno p and it's like bro

1444
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:47,120
Just fucking say it. Just fucking say what you've done. Like you've changed the policies obviously

1445
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:54,480
Um, I don't know why you're pretending you've not because everyone's getting warnings for shit. That was like fine months before

1446
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:02,400
One of my oh, she's moved all to membership and she's still got a yellow. Oh, yeah

1447
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:10,400
No, I get yellow on my a live stream on my membership streams, but I'm pretty outrageous on my membership streams versus like

1448
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:13,680
This stuff

1449
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:20,320
It doesn't matter to youtube the ai will get you and

1450
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:28,160
What it is is the ai that transcribes videos like, you know that thing that literally is like, oh, this is what this person's saying

1451
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:30,240
Oh, this is what that person's saying

1452
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,520
and

1453
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,520
that's basically how the

1454
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:38,720
Determine if the video is bad enough to put limited ads on

1455
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:45,120
So you need to like space out your swears. You need to space out or you can just straight up like

1456
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,760
Swap out words like that's why we say ink

1457
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:51,760
because

1458
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:54,400
There's nothing wrong with the word ink. There's nothing wrong with it. Oh

1459
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,840
Okay, we do good. Um

1460
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:05,760
Or just be Scottish. Yeah, I seem to get away with a lot more than everyone else because I'm like, um

1461
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,520
I do not get as much of limited ads as they do

1462
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:15,120
Um, they all seem to be mega unlucky and I genuinely think it's because it kind of keep up with what I'm

1463
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:17,680
Seeing half the time

1464
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:23,520
Uh ai enforce corporate sense. Yeah, so when um, like emmy got done

1465
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:31,040
It's an ai that did this the rat. Whoa. Whoa. I was speaking of rats. Um, the ai sniffing

1466
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:37,440
It didn't they didn't care that it was a pet rat

1467
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,560
and because the ai identified it

1468
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:47,680
The youtube chose the ai side over being like this is literally a pet rat sniffing a microphone

1469
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,600
We don't know what to tell you

1470
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:56,000
Um, and like youtube chose the ai over like actually having a human review it and it's just they've obviously

1471
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,560
implemented something and it's just absolutely

1472
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:04,960
Just pish and you know, it's causing absolute bedlam for asmr

1473
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:11,440
But obviously but that's the thing. Um asmr is like the fourth most searched

1474
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:13,360
um

1475
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:19,280
Like category on youtube and I think that's my only like this is just a hundred percent my bias

1476
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:25,680
Of like they don't want to publicly say that they're limit in it or discouraging creators from doing it type thing

1477
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:27,680
but

1478
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:32,320
They are and I think they mean they don't want any of the the flak of it

1479
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:36,000
And that's why they're just keeping it hush hush and like just delivering warnings like

1480
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,120
Um, you saw seafoam come in recently

1481
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:42,960
Well, per seafoam had to like fucking delete a shit ton of videos

1482
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:48,480
And she shows her face while making the videos as well. So it's not like audio content

1483
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,600
They can't just be like this is audio content meant for

1484
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:55,520
It's like no like this creator is just

1485
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:00,480
freaking like and there you want to know the extra extra annoying thing

1486
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:05,920
And what the fuck is going on? What did we do?

1487
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:14,160
Um

1488
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,800
I will have

1489
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:26,000
Um, what was the thing before I got distracted by the game? Sorry. I'm enjoying the campaign. I have to admit I really do

1490
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,400
I like the story of this. I like the story of it

1491
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,240
I

1492
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:35,680
Don't want to put effort and resources into actually reviewing this. Yes. Now. I do come pretty. I completely

1493
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:42,400
Comprehend that there is far too much content that gets uploaded to youtube on a daily basis

1494
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:45,040
There's far too much the servers blah blah blah. It's not even profitable

1495
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:53,760
However, if you're going to grant monetization and they've lowered the monetization requirements as well

1496
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:56,720
Um

1497
02:16:57,760 --> 02:16:59,920
Oh, you oh, thank you reflin. I was gonna

1498
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,880
Okay, I think um

1499
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:08,480
Like wait, what was the same kind of cute string of sentence together

1500
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,520
a

1501
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:14,880
Cheek up audio. Hmm. I heard about her play

1502
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:18,240
That's what I'm saying like

1503
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:24,240
If you're gonna lower the monetization so even more channels are monetized. So you're encouraging

1504
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:27,360
People to be like more content if

1505
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,160
Okay, this part is bastardo

1506
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:32,640
monga

1507
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:34,640
Hey, oh my god, it's good. Uh

1508
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:39,840
What your character looks so fucked up. I'm not even he only has one eye

1509
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,200
Jesus whoa

1510
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:47,520
I'm afraid a small deception was necessary

1511
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:50,480
Yeah

1512
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,800
Cameo baggage

1513
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,880
Play does all for saps, didn't she?

1514
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:57,600
The village of toxtad

1515
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:00,400
Avail to conceal my tower nothing more

1516
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:03,680
And now my home has been stolen all the same

1517
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:05,840
Um

1518
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:10,400
To unmake this storm then reclaim it flame must be carried to the urns

1519
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:16,240
For the rich in the beginning. We must accomplish this before she knows they're here. So be sure

1520
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:19,040
What

1521
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:22,320
Okay, I dropped the torch. You'll never believe it, but I dropped the torch already

1522
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:26,400
It was my only eject. It was the whole the torch and I already fail

1523
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Okay, where am I to go?

1524
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:36,080
Where

1525
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,600
Uh

1526
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:44,080
No, no, no stop. Okay, what this way

Okay

1532
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:13,040
My old stress my old story wait, I don't have the torch anymore

1533

I don't know who has the torch do we need to get the torch off of her I put the torch in the pot, but now I don't have a torch

1534
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:29,920

No, he's puking on me. He's a pukling. No

1539
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,800

1547
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,800

trial of treachery

1589
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,280
Why did I call us free?

1590
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:53,360
Thank you treasure seekers. I don't know why I called us treasure seekers

1591
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,440
And there wasn't anything related to the plot

1592
02:23:56,400 --> 02:24:01,680
A sheepster's streaming okay for any harem that might be lurking in the shadows or anyone who is

1598
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,840
I don't really aim for the head. I just get really lucky

1599

Treachery you misread as treasure the irony that I still read it wrong the first time with that sentence

1610
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:27,440
That's right. I can't read and my entire job is about reading and writing

You need to rest and you need to look after yourself and you can't watch every single second of every single day that I put out content

1651
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:30,080

02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:50,560
And you got to read it. No, I think

1656
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:54,560
I don't know if anything actually gets taken out

We're brewing portions. I want you all to understand. I never kept prisoners here

1661
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:14,240

1675
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:20,080

1676
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:22,080
Oh

1677
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:33,600

1678
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:42,240
Also, also, thank you for having me on. Oh, thank you. But no, I enjoy streams. Thanks, Ben

1679
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:48,000
Hopefully you guys can tolerate a bit of overwatch for me. I know I don't pick all the best games, okay

1680
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:55,040
But I just like playing games together. It doesn't really matter what the game is as long as I can kind of be brainless and have fun

1681
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,600
um

1682
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:01,760
I I hope I don't it's not too bad. I can hear a theater

1683
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:07,040
Um

1684
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:13,760
We transcend into dimensional planes after them. Thank you quest for the super chat. Um, no, I as for the marshmallow

1685
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:16,240
I don't think marshmallow has ever blocked anything

1686
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:19,840
I don't really seem to get any

1687
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,880
Marshmallows that are

1688
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,760
Like speaking about

1689
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:32,720
Wait, what you made of a bridge of light. How did you do that? Is there nothing here?

1690
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,840
There's upstairs

1691
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:41,200
Uh a bad game can be made right with terrible company

1692
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:44,000
See, this is how I want you to present to me

1693
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:47,920
Maybe keep your arm on but you need to present and your put your arms down

1694
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:51,520
You don't need to hold it like that, but you need to be on your knees for me

1695
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:58,720
I'm going across the bridge bridge bridge

1696
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:06,480
I'm list

1697
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:11,280
Oh my god, you can't create without boys got a little bracket arms

1698
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:16,720
Are you gonna be okay like more

1699
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:23,840
I'm getting worried you're on your own down there. You better get up here. I hear whispering. I don't want you getting grabbed

1700
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:27,760
Oh, you did it

1701
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:35,600
You can join via a spot. I was gonna get like a

1702
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:39,280
Aim oh, I hear him

1703
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,520
Got a rubbish aim

1704
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:51,360
Okay, there we go, take me a whole second there and

1705
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,480
I was gonna get about

1706
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:58,080
Net I can and then you guys can just

1707
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:04,720
Uh add me on it and then we'll play public lobbies like it'll be five of us versus five enemies

1708
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:10,640
And if we win we get a round of applause with our hands

1709
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:17,040
And if we lose you have to open your mouth enough spit in it

1710
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,760
I was minding my own business, but no

1711
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:32,160
No, no way and we won't say any more about it. I think that's bad. Don't you I didn't overwatch now on stage

1712
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:35,840
It's a reward

1713
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:45,600
Oh lord, no ranked no, no just quickly

1714
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:48,880
I want to try and play Juno

1715
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:54,880
Because that's the newest character. Apparently she's like Anna where she can shoot and heal at the same

1716
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:03,920
Okay, there's healing

1717
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:08,960
I like how they like float once like you perish them

1718
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:17,120
Whoa, what is this? It's got a health bar beat up the candlestick. Fuck that candlestick up. Oh

1719
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:19,760
That's right. I hate interior

1720
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:26,160
Design, I hate the way that you overcharge for I don't even understand who it works. How do you charge someone for design in the house?

1721
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:29,680
Just buy what you like

1722
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:37,600
Do you not just go to a furniture shop and be like oh like that and then buy whatever's in the catalog or something?

1723
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:41,120
I don't I don't know how that stuff works

1724
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:44,720
Hee hee

1725
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:46,720
Okay, we go up the stairs up

1726
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,080
That's it

1727
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:54,960
Did they not make overwatch 66? Oh, I thought it was 5v5. Whoa. What are you? Oh, we're upside down

1728
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:58,560
Wait, we're upside down the world is wrong

1729
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:02,640
Whoa, sorry

1730
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Oopsie

1731
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:10,480
I

1732
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:20,800
Just making it worse. Oh interior decorator heat out

1733
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:28,320
I'm smating it. I'm smating it. I'm smating the crap over it. Everything's been smated

1734
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,040
I send the tower

1735
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:39,840
I'm trying. Oh, oh, I didn't realize

1736
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,640
I go over

1737
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:50,560
I don't know where it is, but it's coming

1738
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,960
Just like you tonight

1739
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Oh, these items are on the ceiling. I don't know why it took me so long to realize we're upside down

1740
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,240
I'm very special

1741
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:08,640
I hear you guys we go here

1742
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:13,520
Bombs, ha

1743
02:36:15,440 --> 02:36:21,600
Kirikou and Baptiste memes depending on my mood at least that wasn't on my pc perished. Oh my god, it nuked herself

1744
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:25,440
What happened?

1745
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:32,160
I think just gave up. It was like, oh, I've done it. The other two are going the right way

1746
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:38,880
Surely you're calling around on the ceiling again. Whoa. I'm not allowed to creep you out from time to time

1747
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:44,320
You let me play with your tentacle and all. Geez. I'm not allowed to go upside down

1748
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,200
Man, you guys have weird rules for me

1749
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:49,200
Oh

1750
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:53,920
Lustrous question mark. Oh, this is like a

1751
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:57,440
Uh thing

1752
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:03,520
His pc perished because I had to run over watch it's overwatch that taxing

1753
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:08,560
I don't know. I thought they optimized it. Well, I've not played in many a year

1754
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:12,000
Well, how long when's the last time I played it?

1755
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:20,320
I hope there are no swords like what year two years possibly. I don't I can't remember the timeline of overwatch

1756
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:30,400
Oh, wait, I got like stun locks. I was the one that was stun locked for once not the enemy

1757
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:34,800
Yeah, taxing for your mental health. Okay, that was good

1758
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:41,040
Hold on. There you go. You get a laugh out of that. That was a good one taxing on your mental health

1759
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Playing over. Oh, it's like a tree that we can climb up

1760
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:50,080
No secret up here

1761
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:53,120
There is a secret

1762
02:37:53,760 --> 02:38:00,320
I'm claiming the tree like a monkey. I am free as can be

1763
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:04,400
There's roots and not on the ground

1764
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:11,600
And I'm getting a little turned around but that's okay because I'm in the trees

1765
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,720
I

1766
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:18,480
Make a really good monkey

1767
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:20,800
I'd be so skilled at it

1768
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,440
Stop it. I can't believe you chased us up here

1769
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,680
go home

1770
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,720
Blizzard did too many dumb things to make me care for any other product

1771
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:36,640
Me trying to oh we can claim me trying to surprise when there's like three reeflings that want to play over watch with me

1772
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:40,400
Like

1773
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:47,840
It's free to play though. I do like I have a preference for games that don't cost money just because I want anyone being like

1774
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:54,880
And I definitely would feel bad if you bought a game just to play with me as well and I'm like

1775
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:00,800
Like is left for dead for you

1776
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:06,640
No left for dead isn't for you

1777
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,040
Neither is deep rock

1778
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:17,440
I want to play the air. I want to force you to play that means the more real game

1779
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:22,880
I don't know if it's gonna be any good or not. Oh, we're back in the tower

1780
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:38,720
Okay, who needs to heal the most which you need to heal the most

1781
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:44,960
You you need to heal the most. Yes. He'll

1782
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Chug chug chug. Hey

1783
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:52,560
What over what over

1784
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,320
So skill

1785
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:58,880
Left for dead is eight quid right now. I think only Ubisoft recently did working

1786
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:02,800
Blizzard in a weird statement if you buy a game don't work. Yeah

1787
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:07,440
Look all I'm saying is

1788
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:15,600
Uh, I have my appreciation for indie studios small studios or that kind of thing

1789
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:18,160
Is it definitely going on?

1790
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,040
Ah

1791
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:26,640
Hold on. I have a bomb. I mean, uh in a video game in Minecraft

1792
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:32,560
And in a video game in Minecraft

1793
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:40,800
Okay, I'm pulling the levers

1794
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,240
I'm pulling all the levers

1795
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:50,960
There's two more

1796
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:56,800
We're down down

1797
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:04,000
Oh, I'm gonna do it what it's not no it is

1798
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:06,080
Oh

1799
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:11,120
Yeah, I like how they're just coughing in the cellar where they're over waiting on me. There you go. We did something hold on

1800
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:13,120
I got it. It's must be

1801
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:18,960
Please mr. FBI. She's just griefing in Minecraft D&D. You have D&D. No wait, that makes it worse

1802
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:24,400
I like TNT so like oh no. Oh, that was lucky

1803
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:27,360
Oh

1804
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:35,440
You sure have an interest in texture pack the Minecraft. Look, this is just an MLG game

1805
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:39,840
The shaders like sometimes the shaders might

1806
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:45,760
Make your pc start a little bit but my pc can keep up with these minecraft shaders. Okay very

1807
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:48,640
Very skilled

1808
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:58,480
The scp games were free and have quite a lot of space to fit reefland

1809
02:41:58,800 --> 02:42:02,960
Yes, I'm not sure what the scp game is about but we'll give it

1810
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:06,400
We'll definitely give it a shot. Maybe we'll do it in halloween because it's scary

1811
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:12,000
And I'll wear my heart rate monitor, but then I feel like if I'm surrounded by

1812
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:15,840
Reefland's looking after me. Maybe the game isn't so scary

1813
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:21,520
If it works

1814
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:24,160
What is it? Oh, it's a telescope

1815
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:30,320
Telescope go on then. Let's see. Oh, it's a popper

1816
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:35,360
Oh, it's gone

1817
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:44,000
Sorry, I'm holding it. Sorry. I'm holding it. I'll let you do it. Sorry. Sorry. I'm holding it

1818
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:46,400
Okay

1819
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:53,440
Three plus four plus two plus one three seven nine one ten

1820
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:56,320
Ten ten times

1821
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,040
Ten ten death

1822
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,280
Oh, he's pondering he's pondering the stars

1823
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,520
Are you squinting me right now? It's not reefland time

1824
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:14,880
Stream sniper, but I can still support you with reefland tax. No, you thought

1825
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:19,360
You just why aren't you giving me money because you can't stream save. That's not how it works

1826
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,280
Thank you the beauty lord for the super chat

1827
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:32,080

02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:36,560
Fire no move reefling reefling. No

1829
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:46,800
Reefling you could have perished bend over for a spank. Not de reefling. You could have got yourself hurt. Give me a heart attack

1830
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:54,720
I'll take this

1831
02:43:58,320 --> 02:44:00,000

02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,200
I'm getting jumped. They're jumping me. They're jumping me stop pauses

1833
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,840
We go through the magic mirror

1834
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:11,760
We do

1835
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,840
Oh gosh, we're in another place now

1836
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:18,160
Wait, did a reefland disconnect?

1837
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:25,920
Wait am I going manual to be did a reefland die? Where's Danny? Why does it not say he's in here?

1838
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:34,800
Zanny discarded the tomes any picked up. Where is he? He died. Did you died in game?

1839
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:38,880
How did I notice this? How did I revive you?

1840
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:41,760
and pictures

1841
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:50,160
Set free we're not even in the same realm as you reefling

1842
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:57,280
A reefland I can't save you you're you're in stratosphere

1843
02:44:58,320 --> 02:45:00,320
You're literally in the stratosphere

1844
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:03,440
I can't save him

1845
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:07,280
Reefling I can't I can't no I can't save you

1846
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:12,080
I don't even

1847
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:14,800
I don't know what I'm doing

1848
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:18,240
I'm stuck

1849
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:22,960
Oh, no, I'm not stuck at all. Sorry. Oh my gosh

1850
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:30,480
Uh, uh, I don't know where they go and all turns around and topsy turvy

1851
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:34,640
I don't understand what's going on, but I think we're doing okay. He went to a better place

1852
02:45:34,880 --> 02:45:39,440
Okay, I find I find the reason we will get you

1853
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:45,680
Hello friends, are we doing today? We're good. We're doing stream sniping

1854
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:49,040
We're finishing the base game

1855
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:53,680
I'm currently master debating on getting

1856
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:56,880
The dlc or not

1857
02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:01,040
But I accidentally advertised us

1858
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:07,920
Uh, yes, I pulled the lever

1859
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:12,960
What did that do did they do anything?

1860
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:19,840
Hmm, I mean, okay, okay

1861
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:25,280
Oh, this is dlc. Wait, how am I playing dlc?

1862
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:29,600
Hey, this is dlc

1863
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:31,600
Let's hope it worked quick

1864
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:39,040
I repeat that and tell me face. Oh, wait, it is. He's a good reflin. He's got where he goes for all the good reflins. So

1865
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:42,320
Uh

1866
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:45,040
I don't know what I'm doing with this

1867
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:54,640
I'm just bringing it anyway. I'm just happy to be here. I'm just following you. I'm just following you

1868
02:46:57,280 --> 02:46:59,280
Uh

1869
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:03,600
You're destroying the alcohol. Why would you do that?

1870
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:07,680
How else am I gonna

1871
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:15,280
That don't say those things that look that's not you're not supposed to say that's what I meant to do

1872
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:17,440
Why am I walking around with a gargoyle's head?

1873
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:22,400
This is free dlc. Oh, did they end up changing it?

1874
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:26,800
Okay

1875
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:29,760
Leave him alone

1876
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:36,800
I'm following you. I don't know if you know where I go

1877
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:39,600
Uh

1878
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:42,560
No, what you're pointing you're pointing

1879
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:48,560
What does that mean you're pointing go that way? I don't know

1880
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:55,280
What what does it say all heroes must be present

1881
02:47:56,880 --> 02:48:00,560
Not a reflin like me with someplace else the milking chamber

1882
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:10,640
Crune

1883
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:16,480
They really said focus focus is that that cannot be the

1884
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:24,240
Okay, protect the reflin protect the reflin protecting replay. I am protecting and loving and thinking

1885
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:28,960
I

1886
02:48:29,360 --> 02:48:31,360
Thank you

1887
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:40,400
Pick up the barrel. Yes. Do we need this gargoyle head? I'm starting to think we don't because we have taken it across quite

1888
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:42,560
a lot of

1889
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:45,600
Areas now and I'm rather compelled

1890
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:48,560
Leave him alone

1891
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:52,480
Leave him alone leave him alone

1892
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:56,080
He's my friend. Okay, so we don't actually need it

1893
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:01,840
And he's your emotional support statue no refling left behind

1894
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:08,400
I suppose you could it too could could be a reflin because you guys do are like all heads

1895
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:12,800
You can just extend your little pentacles when you need

1896
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:21,920
Uh whoops question mark

1897
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:32,400
Malaysia can keep her busy. Uh, what am I to do please bow. Am I to throw it?

1898
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:42,240
Okay, let's try that again

1899
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:45,840
Good night res wheel. Thank you. We've been

Wishing you a good day. Yeah, always a good day when I get stream safe and do

1901
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,640
Because I get to be selfish and not think I'm play with you

1902
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:57,600
Did it work? Oh, it worked

1903
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:03,760
Okay, we're to survive. Oh, oh, oh something's getting me

1904
02:50:07,360 --> 02:50:11,280
Something's getting me really bad. What's it? Wait, am I helping this wall?

1905
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:15,840
Or did I just like walk into the enemy's street or something?

1906
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:19,360
I very much like to heal myself

1907
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:22,160
What the heck am I some what?

1908
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:29,520
I'm sorry. I don't know what is getting me. Did I just keep moving?

1909
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:35,840
Avoid the rotating skill and beam got it

1910
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:41,840
Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Just don't be shit. Just don't be shit again

1911
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:51,760
I don't know how I got healed but I do oh, did you hear me?

1912
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,520
Oh

1913
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:03,520
I don't know where the I can't even see where the witch is

1914
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:09,680
You're pouring me

1915
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:21,280
Come on is it still rotating are we okay?

1916
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:24,960
Are you okay? Are you okay honey?

1917
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:38,640
Please barrel that so dad just throw it into the vortex here all yours

1918
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:54,080
Uh

1919
02:51:54,960 --> 02:51:56,160
Uh

1920
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:59,600
Male stress male stress surely will be fine. Hope you're

1921
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:07,840
Surely I wouldn't horrifically mess this up. I'm hacking and flashing and slashing and hacking

1922
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:18,320
How do you even go armor you're a scalen

1923
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:20,080
I

1924
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:25,680
Didn't make any sense. You're not even bones. You're just like I don't know my imagination at this point

1925
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:33,520
I'm getting motion sick because I have to twirl around in the circle

1926
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:39,840
I get really sick on roundabout. Oh, no, I reflinked down. I repeat reflinked down

1927
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:44,240
Can we have a cheeky revive? I know you're okay. Okay

1928
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:47,200
No

1929
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:49,600
Okay, let's do that first and get rid of you

1930
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:54,880
Time for the bomba

1931
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:01,200
And take your anti sickness meds to play this video game honestly

1932
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:05,120
I'll take a I'll take a quick a few minutes after this one

1933
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:09,200
Uh, because I unironically have been myself and sick going in circles

1934
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:16,640
It's roundabouts are absolutely killer to me. Um, I cannot handle roundabouts at all in cars

1935
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:21,280
They are the bane of my existence and they are the most efficient way for transport

1936
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:23,920
So it kills me on the inside

1937
02:53:25,360 --> 02:53:28,560
Pick up the barrel we're going we're going as fast as we can

1938
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:35,760
A cheeky revive? Nah revive me with em cheek. Wouldn't I not just be suffocating you?

1939
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:39,760
Oh, sorry. I don't want to hit the barrel by accident

1940
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:43,360
No, the rat's chasing him. Stop it

1941
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,960
Did we do it?

1942
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:49,600
Oh, we did it

1943
02:54:00,480 --> 02:54:02,480
She's gone

1944
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:05,040
As I'm sure it will last

1945
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:07,280
Well

1946
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:12,000
He's going around and around and around allegedly me

1947
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:19,680
My home is mine once more and Sophia defeated well past time. I returned you home

1948
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:23,040
Oh, we did it

1949
02:54:23,280 --> 02:54:27,520
So that was originally a dlc that they charged for two levels

1950
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:32,400
They charged money for two levels

1951
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:36,720
I

1952
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:40,400
Know I understand they get told to do that. It's just such a shame that games have to come to that

1953
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:48,720
Okay, I'm gonna stand up for a moment just to recalibrate the old eyeballs

1954
02:54:51,280 --> 02:54:53,280
Oh

1955
02:54:57,520 --> 02:54:59,520
Mmm

1956
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:12,000
No, I think I'm one thing. Fuck you team Xanax. I didn't get one accolade

1957
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:15,920
Xanax there are two mlg

1958
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:22,480
I don't know why my thumb heart is being in trouble

1959
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:24,880
Oh

1960
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:28,400
I'm standing up

1961
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:30,960
I'm sad. I'm marching on the spot

1962
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:35,520
Marchie marchie mark. I'm marching on the spot

1963
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:40,720
I'm so sorry to the damn horse armor. Wait, what?

1964
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:45,200
Sorry, I took all the actually clearly

1965
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:49,280
I got war

1966
02:55:53,440 --> 02:55:55,440
A treadmill at a desk

1967
02:55:56,480 --> 02:56:00,000
Oh, when am I doing this on words? I was thinking of doing like a treadmill stream

1968
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:05,040
But I'm not sure how fun it would be because the only thing I would capture is really my legs down

1969
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:08,320
Oh, sorry. I just headbutted the microphone. If you heard that

1970
02:56:09,440 --> 02:56:15,280
Just feeling a bit violent. Sorry. I do. Excuse me. All right. Let me check. There's no more weathlands. Okay

1971
02:56:16,480 --> 02:56:20,240
Right. Thank you very much team Xanax for stealing all my accolades

1972
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:25,120
And this team should have been called the the Y boys. Every name ends with Y

1973
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:30,400
I mean, if you want to get technical one end is with a Y and I

1974
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:36,560
Okay, thank you for playing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

1975
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:40,880
You're saying that the collective briefings wouldn't want to see your feet

1976
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:44,080
No, mommy don't be the man

1977
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:47,680
I mean, I feel like it would be a wee bit boring, but maybe I'm just being dumb dumb

1978
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:52,240
Okay

1979
02:57:03,360 --> 02:57:05,360
Hold on. Hold on. Just checking

1980
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:17,600
Ah

1981
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:20,160
Mm-hmm. Hold on. Sorry

1982
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:35,600
I'm sorry, that's uncapped for fuck's sake. I'm sorry. I'm like screaming at mercy. Yes, we can do that. No, I mean, yes

1983
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:49,600
I

1984
02:57:57,600 --> 02:57:59,600
Sorry, sorry fucking

1985
02:58:00,160 --> 02:58:02,880
Oh, I can't believe it. I can't believe running a feature bridge. So you have to

1986
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:11,680
Give me the picture copy link paste link

1987
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:15,040
Move the fucking

1988
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,600
Oh

1989
02:58:33,920 --> 02:58:36,800
I've not heard you speak much of your lost whole

1990
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:42,240
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

1991
02:58:47,920 --> 02:59:03,360
Sorry, sorry, fuck. I'm very lucky to be in it. Um

1992
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:11,680
Hmm

1993
02:59:12,400 --> 02:59:14,400
Uh

1994
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:30,320
Right, okay, we have to get right back into do demo. Sorry. I actually probably needed that break from my motion sickness. To be honest

1995
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:36,160
And tan high layers

1996
02:59:38,480 --> 02:59:41,280
Hi later and together

1997
02:59:42,640 --> 02:59:48,800
We make hard-working girls are cute astrani gets to 450 in here. We can do it. No

1998
02:59:50,640 --> 02:59:54,320
Close your lips and don't say that out loud again. What are you talking about? Never heard of it

1999
02:59:55,360 --> 02:59:59,040
Have you and tried creasing the f o v a bit if it's making emotions like

2000
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:02,560
Is that a thing?

2001
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:06,640
Is wait a minute

2002
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:08,800
Oh

2003
03:00:10,320 --> 03:00:17,520
Wait, does this have to be on you got doby tan. Yeah doby tan. That's a good name. Thank you. I'm stealing that

2004
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:19,520
I mean, I came up with it myself to be tan

2005
03:00:23,280 --> 03:00:25,280
Yeah on six five it's low

2006
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:29,520
Yeah, that will go a hundred and see what it looks like

2007
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:33,120
Yeah, sure keep the changes

2008
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:36,080
Sounds like a

2009
03:00:38,960 --> 03:00:42,320
Try again, let's do like a how about that

2010
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:50,720
That's this is better, I think

2011
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:55,680
Don't be tan, um

2012
03:00:57,440 --> 03:00:59,440
That's rather

2013
03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:02,240
Yeah, motion blur on a better or not

2014
03:01:03,840 --> 03:01:05,840
Video

2015
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:25,360
Motion blur, well that probably explains about fucking everything. That's it much better not much

2016
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:27,360
More

2017
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:31,280
Nineties are voted for now. Oh, look at this

2018
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:33,680
Are you guys good?

2019
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:38,480
Why do you look like the three monkeys that are like here? No evil see no evil speak no evil

2020
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:42,320
But instead it's like turning your back. You're just like no, I've had enough. He took too long

2021
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:47,440
Turn on numeric ui. What does that do?

2022
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:52,400
Numeric

2023
03:01:55,360 --> 03:01:57,360
No

2024
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:06,640
Me when I see evil

2025
03:02:08,320 --> 03:02:10,320
It's in gameplay

2026
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Numeric

2027
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:18,400
Numeric

2028
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:27,600
Twitch well both time limit between the fours. Wait, this is a twitch game

2029
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:33,200
Are they have twitch integration

2030
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:39,920
Gameplay's done. I'm not staring at it

2031
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:45,040
Twitch integration, I'm gonna imagine you guys messing with me

2032
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:52,880
Hudson Hudson Hudson numeric

2033
03:02:56,240 --> 03:02:58,240
Limit ui scaling

2034
03:03:00,320 --> 03:03:05,680
Enabling this option will limit the scaling of ui relative to your resolution. This will only affect players who play above

2035
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:08,720
That one

2036
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:12,880
This one

2037
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:18,720
Or this one here

2038
03:03:20,480 --> 03:03:25,920
Enable these to show relevant information such as health ammo until then you met. Oh, you want that?

2039
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:29,440
Why isn't that default the fun?

2040
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:32,160
Oh

2041
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:38,080
That's too easy. Why would that not be a default thing?

2042
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:43,760
Okay, so then our other free dlc has one two three and four

2043
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:48,480
Okay, so

2044
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:53,200
We have another 12 reeflings that can come in if they're available

2045
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:55,920
I

2046
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:00,640
Sprinted halfway across the map

2047
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:04,720
Just a pro game look at them. They see you hate me

2048
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:11,840
Add a message from an old acquaintance up in karak asgar as

2049
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:17,680
Seems the dwarfs are looking to reclaim kazid crow from the rat men

2050
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:20,560
And of course it's all gone a bit wrong

2051
03:04:21,280 --> 03:04:24,240
I'd better send in the uber schreik five

2052
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:28,800
Turns out there's more at stay here than at first glance

2053
03:04:45,200 --> 03:04:47,200
Okay, we're doing it

2054
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:50,160
Now we must get embarrassed

2055
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:01,440
Shield vermin incoming

2056
03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:08,160
Is he's letting me squeeze it

2057
03:05:09,440 --> 03:05:15,120
Right where are we going? Oh, there's like a big walkway over here

2058
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:21,760
How go with the great slot there good replaying we're just

2059
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:26,080
Wait, what why does a secret tunnel?

2060
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:30,480
There's a secret entrance here

2061
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:34,080
Or is that because I triggered some

2062
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:37,760
Um

2063
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:45,840
We're finishing off the vermin tight so they release some dlc public like for public access and we're just going through that

2064
03:05:46,240 --> 03:05:49,920
I'm not buying the actual dlc though because they're wet farts

2065
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:52,880
And I don't believe in it. Um

2066
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:58,400
But hardly any of us have done these levels. So we're all staggering about we're not sure what we're doing

2067
03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:03,040
My brother thought karellian was supposed to be irish. It happens all the time

2068
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:05,280
um

2069
03:06:05,280 --> 03:06:07,280
I'm not really

2070
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:10,240
Right

2071
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:15,760
Um, sorry, I need to I need to try hard with hook right. Um

2072
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:19,440
I don't

2073
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:23,120
Obviously cuz I'm scottish. It's really obvious the difference to me

2074
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:27,840
But I guess if you're not used to hearing like foreign accents type thing

2075
03:06:28,240 --> 03:06:33,840
It can be like oh what one's what but I always get called irish first before scottish

2076
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:39,280
Um, it's just curious because like, you know, irelander kind of known for the way they

2077
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:48,000
Anunciate on certain words like this or is the scottish are like more mumbly and the r's are a lot harsher like ghetto

2078
03:06:48,560 --> 03:06:50,560
it's not it's not like

2079
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:52,640
girl

2080
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:54,640
girl ghetto

2081
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:58,400
girl like the r's are a lot harsher in anything we ever do

2082
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:01,200
um

2083
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:04,400
It's the way german and dutch and some are most people

2084
03:07:07,520 --> 03:07:10,560
Secret tunnel that's just your starfish stop it

2085
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:14,640
Not much of a secret tunnel

2086
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:18,320
When you can visit at any time

2087
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:25,360
But yeah, you're getting a scott's lesson. Yes, we say r's a lot harsher

2088
03:07:26,240 --> 03:07:28,240
like if you see

2089
03:07:28,400 --> 03:07:32,560
Mer properly, it's actually mirror like mirror

2090
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:39,840
Mirror like we say r's so harsh and we don't say t's in the middle of words. So

2091
03:07:40,960 --> 03:07:42,960
um

2092
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:44,960
You know

2093
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:47,600
Hold on

2094
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
I'm helping I'm helping

2095
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:52,560
Apparently I am

2096
03:07:52,960 --> 03:07:56,080
I can't think of any other unwritten rules about scottish

2097
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:01,120
Like

2098
03:08:04,480 --> 03:08:06,480
The grand chasm

2099
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:09,680
Not to be confused with the grand chasm

2100
03:08:12,480 --> 03:08:16,960
Mommy believe it must be for its own all that permission. I'm alone in let's go

2101
03:08:19,200 --> 03:08:25,200
And there's so many reeflands that are scarce like come on at least let me try it once and see these things

2102
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:28,080
You don't have to be scared

2103
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:32,560
Oh, we jump over. Okay, we just jump over

2104
03:08:46,240 --> 03:08:49,760
And if you want to see order order

2105
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:54,800
Today we're going to pack this customer's order

2106
03:08:55,360 --> 03:08:59,680
And they had chicken chow mein and chaps

2107
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:03,360
With a curry sauce

2108
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:11,680
I will show you that I will literally download it and show you at one point. I keep forgetting to do it

2109
03:09:12,320 --> 03:09:14,160
because I'm just

2110
03:09:14,160 --> 03:09:16,160
a giver, okay

2111
03:09:16,640 --> 03:09:18,640
All right

2112
03:09:18,640 --> 03:09:23,120
It's just the vocal fries like whoa, I cannot take that on hold on a minute. Thank you reeflings

2113
03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:25,840
I cannot take that on

2114
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:28,480
I was feeling a bit boldly. Okay

2115
03:09:28,880 --> 03:09:30,880
a very demure

2116
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:33,040
I mean

2117
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:37,760
I stopped doing it, but there's just something so satisfying about doing it like I'm not even kidding

2118
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:42,080
Go and try and mimic me when I say order that way

2119
03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:48,800
Like literally give yourself a vocal fry when you say it like out loud. I don't care if it's cringy order

2120
03:09:49,440 --> 03:09:56,480
Like it's really satisfying to see it like that. Oh my god, it's a shop reefling. Oh my god reefling. What will we sell? We'll sell

2121
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:02,640
Fake scotch, she doesn't cook haggis

2122
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:08,320
You can spell it right haggis

2123
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:12,080
Gigi oh my god, we're such gamers

2124
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:16,400
Vocal fry my unbeloved

2125
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:21,280
Oh my god, like take me over

2126
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:25,520
And today I'm going to take the reeflings throw here

2127
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:27,760
Arder

2128
03:10:28,400 --> 03:10:30,560
When you know when the what?

2129
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:36,880
I want to go to the island. Why won't you let me go?

2130
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:41,280
I suddenly steven walking

2131
03:10:42,960 --> 03:10:47,120
And today I'm going to go to every island

2132
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:49,920
What's that?

2133
03:10:50,400 --> 03:10:52,400
I was on the lifelong

2134
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:55,200
We're everything's island. No

2135
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:59,120
Let me go to the island. I want to go

2136
03:11:00,640 --> 03:11:02,640
I didn't know I could do that

2137
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:08,160
If you didn't know uh, steven hawkin was on the obscene flay logs

2138
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:11,600
So some

2139
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:17,840
Comedian was like I want to go to the island. Why won't you let me go and that's what I'm trying to make

2140
03:11:20,080 --> 03:11:23,200
Sorry if you didn't know the context of that. Can you shoot that? No

2141
03:11:24,720 --> 03:11:26,720
Um

2142
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:31,600
Stony was it you that frame talking framed? Oh, I've not heard of that theory

2143
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:38,640
I honestly just kind of accept. I'm like, yeah, I'm not really surprised anymore

2144
03:11:42,320 --> 03:11:44,320
That oh, maybe I should be more

2145
03:11:55,360 --> 03:12:00,240
It's like that skyroom quest give me the money now or I'll yell skeever

2146
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:04,640
Help stabilize the pressure

2147
03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:07,040
Under pressure

2148
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:09,040
Okay, I'm uh, I'm gonna stabilize the old one

2149
03:12:09,280 --> 03:12:13,040
I got it. I'm turning the bell

2150
03:12:15,280 --> 03:12:17,280
It's a price you can't

2151
03:12:19,760 --> 03:12:30,480
No, she's the one who voice the takes the speech. Hello, my name is runny cuddle. I have a mean humor

2152
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:38,960
Push down on you push down on me. What's going on? We're pushing on each other. I'm pushing so hard right now

2153
03:12:42,240 --> 03:12:46,480
I think most people who hate vocal price focus on the vibrate sound and not the high pitch new part

2154
03:12:48,560 --> 03:12:52,640
I want to read wait what's the vocal price? Wait, hold on

2155
03:12:53,840 --> 03:12:55,840
Or order

2156
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:58,160
Come on today

2157
03:12:58,960 --> 03:13:03,520
I can't do it. What my brain's trying to make it nasally and vocal price

2158
03:13:06,960 --> 03:13:13,760
We're gonna practice we're gonna practice customers order like what wait my brain can't comprehend making it nasally

2159
03:13:16,880 --> 03:13:18,880
Well, hold on I'm gonna need to hold my nose

2160
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:21,600
Hi, Reefless

2161
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:23,600
Okay

2162
03:13:28,560 --> 03:13:30,560
Yeah

2163
03:13:33,440 --> 03:13:35,440
You simply that meme of the moon alpha

2164
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:38,160
Don't matter. Oh, I don't know that one

2165
03:13:38,640 --> 03:13:40,640
Stony's ai confront me. Yeah

2166
03:13:41,360 --> 03:13:43,360
Pre-recorded ai

2167
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:45,360
can't believe it

2168
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:51,360
My gameplay is definitely that of a bot. I'll agree with that statement. If that's someone you want to make

2169
03:13:51,840 --> 03:13:53,840
I'm not gonna argue

2170
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:55,840
I'm actually not gonna argue

2171
03:13:56,800 --> 03:14:00,240
And after this game, I'm gonna grab a muffin

2172
03:14:01,920 --> 03:14:08,160
That's it. That's my sentence. I'm gonna grab a muffin. It'll literally take me like five seconds. Owie

2173
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
You better relax

2174
03:14:14,960 --> 03:14:18,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't even make heads or tails. What's going on?

2175
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:24,480
I'm just swinging

2176
03:14:26,720 --> 03:14:28,720
Already

2177
03:14:29,440 --> 03:14:31,440
John Madden

2178
03:14:32,560 --> 03:14:35,200
She sounds like a curse speaking spell

2179
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:39,040
Okay, I'm gonna drink

2180
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:46,960
What

2181
03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:52,640
Oh, we're friends

2182
03:14:56,560 --> 03:14:58,560
Hmm

2183
03:14:58,880 --> 03:15:04,000
She's worse than normally. She's Scottish. Anyway, sounds good. I might go for an hour nap

2184
03:15:06,240 --> 03:15:08,240
Leapy Reefland

2185
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:13,280
I'm definitely going for a nap after this stream. Then I'll see about that. You're

2186
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:16,160
I'm not gonna walk in that

2187
03:15:16,400 --> 03:15:20,000
I'm I'll see about that you're blowing audio. So don't be surprised if it comes

2188
03:15:26,320 --> 03:15:28,320
Oh

2189
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:41,200
This secret

2190
03:15:41,200 --> 03:15:44,400
I don't want to insult it. I'm trying to stop myself from singing it too much because I'm like

2191
03:15:44,400 --> 03:15:47,120
I will have done is like sing through this entire stream

2192
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:51,040
I don't know like I hear a word and I'm like, oh that word's in that one song

2193
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:55,760
I would like to sing that one song now, but because I never know the words to anything

2194
03:15:56,480 --> 03:16:00,560
I'm just like mumble for like two sentences and I'm like, okay, that's me. I'm done

2195
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
She says nap, but you mean recharge

2196
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:11,680
I mean, I guess it's technically how no way that's the first time I've ever done that and

2197
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
The

2198
03:16:16,240 --> 03:16:22,640
Hmm like cuz I don't sleep a full eight hours before stream, it's kind of like how I get my later hours

2199
03:16:36,320 --> 03:16:38,320
Fanged

2200
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:44,160
The tunnels is the current objective. I mean, does this not count as being in the tunnels yet or

2201
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:53,280
I'm just following the trailer enemies. I like when the games do that. That's the best game design

2202
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:55,840
I don't care why no one says let's just follow the tunnel of enemy

2203
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:01,120
Well, if I'm not mistaken, this looks like our location

2204
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:06,720
I just chopped his arm off. I feel kind of bad. Sorry

2205
03:17:08,400 --> 03:17:10,560
Don't forget to bring your reefing body pillow

2206
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:12,720
Oh

2207
03:17:13,600 --> 03:17:15,600
Should we get that? Whoa

2208
03:17:20,960 --> 03:17:24,960
You just teleported on my screen, I don't know if you experienced that but you did on mine

2209
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:33,040
It's because she forgot to plug herself and no

2210
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:38,880
I'm behaving

2211
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:41,600
Where's the most part?

2212
03:17:46,480 --> 03:17:51,120
Wait, are we gonna have we just done a 360? No, no, this is new

2213
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:55,600
Is it new?

2214
03:17:56,480 --> 03:17:58,720
I'm doubting myself. Have we been here before?

2215
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:02,640
No, we haven't we can't have been

2216
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,000
No

2217
03:18:06,560 --> 03:18:08,560
I'm over thinking

2218
03:18:09,680 --> 03:18:11,680
Oh

2219
03:18:17,600 --> 03:18:19,600
We definitely made it now

2220
03:18:24,080 --> 03:18:27,840
We should bash them together like the block bash and just bully one

2221
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:36,880
Shall we squish in a reefland between the thighs back here? I'd be done for that

2222
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:43,920
Like you already know 100% if I do get a ducky design, you're in it. Like you're literally in any of the designs

2223
03:18:45,440 --> 03:18:47,440
I'm not having any other way

2224
03:18:50,960 --> 03:18:55,120
I'm not having any other way reefling literally every step of the way

2225
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:00,880
Wait for the explosive

2226
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:09,040
Oh

2227
03:19:09,280 --> 03:19:16,240
You have blaryed him. Whoa. I thought I spoke to my my piece to leave. Let's just start

2228
03:19:17,840 --> 03:19:19,840
Anyway, I started swinging

2229
03:19:23,840 --> 03:19:26,000
That reefling in particular amen

2230
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:33,520
We could also be a charming plushie and the ducky could be a reefling

2231
03:19:37,440 --> 03:19:39,440
Mud

2232
03:19:40,320 --> 03:19:42,320
What

2233
03:19:43,760 --> 03:19:47,200
The wait the ducky could have a reefling shaped hole in it. Wait

2234
03:19:48,720 --> 03:19:53,840
Oh, I thought you were making a own a whole joke. Sorry. Wait, I thought you were making an own a whole joke

2235
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:58,160
Suspiciously

2236
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:03,600
I'm being a dumb dumb

2237
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:05,760
I

2238
03:20:06,080 --> 03:20:13,520
Don't think too hard about it. I was kind of sorry. Sorry. I'm a dumb ass. I thought you were making a joke about

2239
03:20:14,480 --> 03:20:17,440
It being in the reefland plushie and I was like, no

2240
03:20:18,560 --> 03:20:20,080
You're not

2241
03:20:20,080 --> 03:20:22,400
Oh, sorry. I just hit that. I don't know if that's gonna explode

2242
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:29,120
I don't pick up the barrel and put it where

2243
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:31,120
I

2244
03:20:32,560 --> 03:20:34,560
What

2245
03:20:34,960 --> 03:20:36,960
Hey

2246
03:20:37,840 --> 03:20:40,560
I need to go up. I need to go up. How'd I go up?

2247
03:20:44,400 --> 03:20:47,920
I need to go up. Hold on. Wait. I can't even find the way up

2248
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:49,920
I

2249
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,000
Am I going

2250
03:20:56,160 --> 03:21:00,080
Mental I can't figure which way it goes. Stop leave me alone. I'm too dumb

2251
03:21:03,440 --> 03:21:05,680
Like two of us can keep shooting down a hallway. Okay

2252
03:21:08,880 --> 03:21:10,880
I don't know where the way up is

2253
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:16,880
Stony plushie with the strange whole shape didn't no, that's what you're seeing

2254
03:21:27,920 --> 03:21:29,920
We need to see the end of one of these

2255
03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:32,640
Um

2256
03:21:39,920 --> 03:21:41,920
Right

2257
03:21:44,480 --> 03:21:46,480
Oh, okay

2258
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:52,320
Well, I've got one so this is progress or hey, copy them

2259
03:21:53,280 --> 03:21:57,440
No, no, no, no, leave me alone. Okay. No, well, okay, that worked

2260
03:21:58,160 --> 03:22:00,160
That was one

2261
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:07,760
Okay, I'm up here

2262
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:15,040
Okay, I've done my part. There's four reflins. I did one third of the work. I'll take it

2263
03:22:18,480 --> 03:22:25,200
I'm halting. Okay, and then this is where the other one goes. Okay, so I need to grab a barrel. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Stop. Stop

2264
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:28,640
I literally can't see when we do that

2265
03:22:31,360 --> 03:22:38,080
Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Go reflin. Go you can go. Oh sugar. Did that break the barrel?

2266
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:42,080
Oh the barrel. Oh no, just throw it in

2267
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:46,080
Okay, good and it blows up

2268
03:22:46,320 --> 03:22:48,320
We did it. We did it. Now what?

2269
03:22:49,200 --> 03:22:51,200
Another one another one another one

2270
03:22:55,200 --> 03:22:57,200
Okay

2271
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:02,000
I heard it hissing

2272
03:23:05,840 --> 03:23:07,920
Yeah, I get spawn camped bitch

2273
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:14,480
Shouldn't use all my ammo with that though

2274
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:17,360
Uh

2275
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:20,720
No, hold on

2276
03:23:22,400 --> 03:23:24,400
I do like

2277
03:23:25,920 --> 03:23:30,240
Oh, it's here. It's here. That's right. Yeah

2278
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:35,920
Uh

2279
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:38,080
It's here. I have it

2280
03:23:40,480 --> 03:23:43,840
It's a not thought but I just thought of a fun idea for a mode

2281
03:23:44,400 --> 03:23:50,960
Revoids carrying whenever she would say may fly. She says refling instead. Oh, that would be cute

2282
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:54,560
Help me refling

2283
03:23:54,720 --> 03:23:56,720
Just like that off the top of my boy

2284
03:23:57,920 --> 03:23:59,920
Revelling

2285
03:24:01,280 --> 03:24:08,560
And when I'm getting grabbed by a thingy, I'm like choke. I like realize please. You're the only one that's supposed to choke me

2286
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:15,920
I'm fighting the the ink right now

2287
03:24:18,640 --> 03:24:23,200
Can the ducky have a squeaker in it? So let me squeeze it. Oh my god. I would go crazy

2288
03:24:23,760 --> 03:24:28,880
If I could get a refling plushy and it had this squeaker in it, I'd go absolutely feral

2289
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:37,440
And then every time oh and then oh I could do ASMR thigh squeezing

2290
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:44,720
But it'd be called thigh squeezing squeaking ASMR. Oh my gosh. I would go absolutely feral if I could get that

2291
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,440
ready

2292
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,000
All right, okay, hold on. Let me him with a pose

2293
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:55,760
And

2294
03:24:58,640 --> 03:25:02,000
Over here already I skipped through the bridge of shadows

2295
03:25:03,520 --> 03:25:05,520
We did

2296
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:12,720
The refling plush better have a wiki cushion in it. No, you're not gonna be out of blending

2297
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,240
You're not gonna be too and I'm not gonna make it too

2298
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:19,760
Whenever you squeeze the plush it inks itself

2299
03:25:20,720 --> 03:25:23,920
You know like those party things where it goes like

2300
03:25:25,280 --> 03:25:27,920
Oh, sorry. That was a really bad like a party

2301
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:31,840
And it comes and rolls out and then it goes

2302
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:36,560
I don't know what they're called

2303
03:25:36,800 --> 03:25:41,920
But one of those but if I squeeze the plushy one of your tentacles gets really big

2304
03:25:42,880 --> 03:25:46,480
And like it unravels and ink comes out of it

2305
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:55,760
Like a squeak. Are you blowing to our parties? Is that a party horn when it's like a circle and it comes out?

2306
03:25:58,080 --> 03:26:00,400
Wow, I wasn't useless. I did the most headshots

2307
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:04,560
Silly string

2308
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:10,560
GG that was a really good thing. We've got three more missions

2309
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:12,560
Dun dun dun

2310
03:26:13,360 --> 03:26:16,240
Yeah, obviously the surrounding plush has a wiki cushion in it. Yeah

2311
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:20,000
A party chamber. It must be a party horn then

2312
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:25,520
I know what you're talking about but I don't want to feel squeeze the plush and it starts vomiting

2313
03:26:25,840 --> 03:26:27,840
Oh, that would be an alternative version

2314
03:26:28,320 --> 03:26:30,720
Yeah, the thing that like it unravels and it goes

2315
03:26:32,320 --> 03:26:34,720
You're telling us to blow a refling. No, I'm

2316
03:26:36,160 --> 03:26:38,560
A vomit refling when you turn it upside down it goes

2317
03:26:41,120 --> 03:26:43,120
Oh

2318
03:26:44,720 --> 03:26:46,720
One of them

2319
03:26:47,840 --> 03:26:48,960
Bye

2320
03:26:48,960 --> 03:26:50,960
Yes, I'm winning absolutely

2321
03:26:51,440 --> 03:26:55,600
Those rolled up paper things that sound like a flat kazoo. Yeah, are they just called party horn?

2322
03:26:56,080 --> 03:27:01,520
This is a party horn. Okay. I didn't realize it was called a horn. Bye. Bye moment. Bye. Bye reform

2323
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:03,600
Thank you for stream sniping

2324
03:27:03,680 --> 03:27:08,000
Okay, I'm gonna very quickly go grab a muffin and go for a pee because I have I have

2325
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:12,800
Lots of urine in my bladder right now. Okay, I'll be right back. I'll be a moment

2326
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:40,000
So

2327
03:28:08,480 --> 03:28:10,480
You

2328
03:28:25,200 --> 03:28:27,200
You know what I think

2329
03:28:27,440 --> 03:28:34,320
Do I know what an elf thinks? No one does. I don't think you really are searching for karexon

2330
03:28:34,720 --> 03:28:38,000
Preposterous, you don't know what you're saying. Don't I?

2331
03:28:38,720 --> 03:28:43,440
You forget. I've observed your search for some time now spying. Is it?

2332
03:28:43,760 --> 03:28:47,680
Ah, of course. Ima would tell you that's what we do. So include

2333
03:28:48,240 --> 03:28:53,680
The well-earned slight by the sound of it. I don't think you're seeking anything at all

2334
03:28:55,520 --> 03:29:01,680
I think you're avoiding going through and if I'm right choose your next words carefully

2335
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:09,040
Then you have my sympathy that is all I hope you find whatever it is you're really seeking

2336
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:33,680
So

2337
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:35,680
So

2338
03:29:35,680 --> 03:29:37,680
So

2339
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:39,680
So

2340
03:29:39,680 --> 03:29:41,680
So

2341
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:03,120

03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:47,200
And then we've just done mission of mercy. We're now doing

2373
03:32:48,240 --> 03:32:50,240
a grudge

2374
03:32:50,640 --> 03:32:52,640
A grudge served cool

2375
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:55,520
Then we'll go two more missions

2376
03:33:04,640 --> 03:33:06,640
Oh, no

2377
03:33:06,880 --> 03:33:08,880

I don't know how this usually goes

2383
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:39,200
Shipping and hostages

2384
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:46,880

Your plushies should have a dumpy thick cake ice Johnny has a good replaying. We're almost finished. I'm getting nervous

2390
03:34:24,480 --> 03:34:26,480
Oh

2391
03:34:27,680 --> 03:34:33,200
Everyone who's wanting to play has a chance. I don't mind replaying missions to make sure everyone gets a chance

2392
03:34:37,360 --> 03:34:39,360
Yeah

2393
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:42,800
Okay, now I bite my muffin

2394
03:34:46,960 --> 03:34:51,200
I think I can get home fat. Please do not speed home though. Just take your time

2395
03:34:51,920 --> 03:34:53,920
The rounds take a while everything's fine

2396
03:34:55,760 --> 03:34:57,760
Actually some champion legend out

2397
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:03,120
Oh

2398
03:35:07,200 --> 03:35:11,360
Are you just used to taking hostages where you're forced to listen to pregnancy tomorrow

2399
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:15,600
But I'm recreating it in real life and you need to go inside right now

2400
03:35:27,920 --> 03:35:29,920
Oh nothing's on

2401
03:35:29,920 --> 03:35:31,920
I

2402
03:35:34,800 --> 03:35:40,800
Know to wash it down with spray and then we start the health journey today. I'm getting chicken and making soup

2403
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:57,280
Where did the elf go ahead of things

2404
03:35:59,920 --> 03:36:01,920
Oh

2405
03:36:04,720 --> 03:36:06,720
I see her

2406
03:36:07,520 --> 03:36:11,520
You're hating on that rock. Okay. We're ready. Let's go

2407
03:36:12,640 --> 03:36:15,520
Can I be your muffin moment you want me to eat you?

2408
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:18,880
Isn't that dangerous

2409
03:36:19,760 --> 03:36:21,760
Well time to put on my best. I'm going

2410
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:25,760
We're in the forest

2411
03:36:30,240 --> 03:36:34,720
Hmm, such a bloom. You'll never guess. Well, I'm capable

2412
03:36:39,280 --> 03:36:42,640
The muffin man the one who lives on brulee

2413
03:36:59,920 --> 03:37:01,920
I

2414
03:37:02,960 --> 03:37:04,960
The muffin song there's a muffin song

2415
03:37:18,160 --> 03:37:20,640
I need all your luck in the world though for how this uh

2416
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:26,960
Soup making is gonna go. So basically I need to soak lentils. I know that for a fact

2417
03:37:26,960 --> 03:37:30,960
I need to soak lentils so they cook properly because lentils are like so hard and dry

2418
03:37:31,200 --> 03:37:34,800
I don't know if you're supposed to soak them overnight though. I bloody hope not. It's not mental

2419
03:37:36,080 --> 03:37:38,080
Me reading the instructions on the packet of lentils

2420
03:37:39,200 --> 03:37:41,200
Don't mind me and my ignorance

2421
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:48,880
Oh

2422
03:37:57,280 --> 03:37:59,280
Oh

2423
03:38:03,440 --> 03:38:05,440
Okay, I know that's

2424
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,560
You just like tentacles

2425
03:38:09,680 --> 03:38:13,920
You need to kick rocks and suck tentacles and I'm all over rocks to kick

2426
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:28,960
So

2427
03:38:37,920 --> 03:38:43,600
Oh, we got tome already. Have you found two tomes already? We just started the level is this level super short?

2428
03:38:44,560 --> 03:38:46,560
i mean spank

2429
03:38:46,560 --> 03:38:48,080
i mean spank

2430
03:38:48,080 --> 03:38:50,080
i like trains

2431
03:38:50,320 --> 03:38:52,320
I

2432
03:38:52,720 --> 03:38:57,120
Was watching an airplane game. It was called airport ceo

2433
03:38:58,080 --> 03:38:58,960
and

2434
03:38:58,960 --> 03:39:03,200
I watched like people that like review games to be like would I like that or would I not?

2435
03:39:04,240 --> 03:39:05,520
and

2436
03:39:05,520 --> 03:39:10,800
And it looked really good, but the setup took so long and I was like, oh, I don't think I can play it on stream

2437
03:39:11,280 --> 03:39:18,080
But it looked like a really well-rounded game. You like have an airport and you have to like put down like baggage claim and all that stuff

2438
03:39:18,080 --> 03:39:19,440
It's quite cute

2439
03:39:19,440 --> 03:39:25,040
Um, but there is a game that I found it's not out yet. It's to come out on

2440
03:39:26,160 --> 03:39:29,520
quarter four of this year so soon tm

2441
03:39:30,320 --> 03:39:32,320
and it's called

2442
03:39:33,120 --> 03:39:34,720
dungeon

2443
03:39:34,720 --> 03:39:37,440
qualler and it's a roguelite

2444
03:39:38,720 --> 03:39:40,720
vending machine game

2445
03:39:41,360 --> 03:39:47,200
Um, I know that sounds bizarre, but it's like a really good concept. I really enjoyed it and I have it planned

2446
03:39:49,040 --> 03:39:53,280
We'll play the only the demo is available right now. Um

2447
03:39:54,480 --> 03:39:56,480
But it looks really cute

2448
03:39:56,480 --> 03:40:01,840
So we're gonna play the demo for a stream just to enjoy and see what it's like. It looks really cute, but yeah

2449
03:40:02,560 --> 03:40:04,320
um

2450
03:40:04,320 --> 03:40:10,240
Let's go gambling on me. I don't know if we're gonna win or anything, but it just looks like a casual game

2451
03:40:12,240 --> 03:40:13,920
And

2452
03:40:14,000 --> 03:40:18,560
So I didn't question its authority. Uh, I thought it was cute

2453
03:40:20,560 --> 03:40:22,640
And um

2454
03:40:22,640 --> 03:40:24,960
Yeah, we're gonna play it like in three weeks

2455
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:29,520
I'm not

2456
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:33,760
Perfectly done my schedule like a lot. I didn't realize Juno was out so

2457
03:40:34,960 --> 03:40:42,480
Uh, Overwatch has been bumped up a little bit. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Okay, but I did like Overwatch

2458
03:40:42,560 --> 03:40:46,080
So it'd be nice to play it with you. Um, and we'll see how it goes

2459
03:40:48,400 --> 03:40:54,480
Um, but a few things need shuffled around now this week. I'm only doing two membership streams

2460
03:40:55,280 --> 03:40:59,760
But I might do four next week to make up for it like as an apology and be like

2461
03:41:02,320 --> 03:41:04,320
Um

2462
03:41:04,880 --> 03:41:05,760
Um

2463
03:41:05,760 --> 03:41:11,120
Trying to find like the good balance between like a two three hour game experience because then I can go on and do a

2464
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:13,120
Membership yapping stream without like being

2465
03:41:14,160 --> 03:41:16,160
Too tired or anything like that

2466
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:20,320
Because let's be honest all my membership streams are literally yapping go down mommy

2467
03:41:22,640 --> 03:41:27,680
Why would go down I've got all these kills so I can be first on the killboard leader because you guys always take my accolades

2468
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:32,000
He

2469
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:34,000
Come here. I'm coming

2470
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:36,080
Oh

2471
03:41:36,400 --> 03:41:41,840
Maybe a good stream save game would be war thunder war thunder wait, that's a stream save game

2472
03:41:43,200 --> 03:41:45,600
I don't know much about war thunder. Unfortunately

2473
03:41:46,720 --> 03:41:49,280
I'm only reading size ago. We kicking ass

2474
03:41:50,240 --> 03:41:52,240
We're we're surviving until the gate

2475
03:41:56,480 --> 03:41:58,480
Oh

2476
03:42:01,440 --> 03:42:03,440
There's something throwing bombs at

2477
03:42:04,880 --> 03:42:06,880
That's it. Everyone's getting swung on

2478
03:42:12,080 --> 03:42:14,080
You

2479
03:42:14,640 --> 03:42:17,360
Who's that one that's throwing shit I can't see him

2480
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:24,880
What do you mean his whole purpose is to stop you from seeing and hurt you I can't believe it

2481
03:42:24,960 --> 03:42:26,960
He's achieving his goals

2482
03:42:34,240 --> 03:42:38,880
Oh, thanks for saving me nothing had me choked up the fuck

2483
03:42:47,840 --> 03:42:51,280
Don't even ask if I can make that noise wait, we ought to push it together

2484
03:42:52,880 --> 03:42:54,880
No, the gurgles the death gurgle

2485
03:42:56,160 --> 03:42:58,160
new noises on

2486
03:42:58,960 --> 03:43:05,280
The bonus is oh, yeah, you get tingles you want me to do that in each ear of the microphone for 20 minutes

2487
03:43:12,960 --> 03:43:16,480
Team fortress too. Yeah, I think they fixed the servers in team fortress

2488
03:43:18,160 --> 03:43:19,680
I've never like

2489
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:20,880
played it

2490
03:43:20,880 --> 03:43:27,600
But I would definitely play it with you. I want to be the Scottish one. I think his name is no his name's not heavy his name's

2491
03:43:29,040 --> 03:43:32,800
So engineer is the Scottish one

2492
03:43:34,480 --> 03:43:40,160
If not, I'll play the healer. Let's be honest. Oh demo man. Sorry down

2493
03:43:42,160 --> 03:43:45,280
Okay, we're to follow the road demo man is the first one

2494
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:52,320
And then I can be annoyed that they made them have a really harsh Scottish accent instead of just a regular Scottish person

2495
03:43:52,320 --> 03:43:56,960
Let's keep we need to play that oil rig game. I keep over in the ravine

2496
03:43:58,640 --> 03:44:02,480
We'll play the oil rig game soon. Am I going the wrong way?

2497
03:44:04,720 --> 03:44:06,720
And the reef is under attack

2498
03:44:08,720 --> 03:44:15,280
Is the doctor he is a German is he a German man? Does he say uh

2499
03:44:16,240 --> 03:44:18,240
Can

2500
03:44:19,520 --> 03:44:21,520
Do it

2501
03:44:24,080 --> 03:44:26,240
Do it's the stain nine

2502
03:44:27,920 --> 03:44:29,920
Klein and do it

2503
03:44:30,240 --> 03:44:35,120
Yeah, Klein and do it. Nice. Nice. Do it's the stain nine

2504
03:44:36,160 --> 03:44:38,160
That's the best I got

2505
03:44:38,240 --> 03:44:43,280
Maybe you like slain rancher. I put it down on the list. I put slain rancher too

2506
03:44:43,440 --> 03:44:51,040
On the lit. I put it in the schedule. You're in my head replaying. How did you know I put down slain rancher too?

2507
03:44:52,000 --> 03:44:54,000
I can't believe it

2508
03:44:54,400 --> 03:44:56,400
I put down too. Should I play one?

2509
03:44:57,120 --> 03:44:59,120
or

2510
03:44:59,280 --> 03:45:06,000
It's cute. Yeah, I was gonna pretend and we'll play that with my leaflin farm because you're all cute little slains

2511
03:45:07,920 --> 03:45:10,640
Even if you look a little bit different, you're still a leaflin

2512
03:45:13,760 --> 03:45:16,560
I'm luke sahan's infants

2513
03:45:18,320 --> 03:45:20,320
And your head in your head

2514
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:23,840
In your head

2515
03:45:35,440 --> 03:45:38,320
Um, I think we're gonna have to take chances

2516
03:45:43,440 --> 03:45:46,640
Ice makes me so nervous like this because in

2517
03:45:47,440 --> 03:45:52,080
Scotland like lakes and rivers and that like or no, not rivers

2518
03:45:52,960 --> 03:45:54,640
Rivers are moving more

2519
03:45:54,640 --> 03:45:59,440
Lakes in that get frozen over but there's so many stories of um folks like

2520
03:46:00,080 --> 03:46:05,120
Genuinely falling in and like being close to death and that I just don't trust that I would never go on a frozen lake

2521
03:46:05,200 --> 03:46:09,920
I then I trust it. I would have to be like sub temperatures like sub 10

2522
03:46:10,640 --> 03:46:17,040
Celsius or some shit like if I you know, I had a preference of stepping on it because uh, I do not trust

2523
03:46:18,480 --> 03:46:20,480
That stuff at all

2524
03:46:20,960 --> 03:46:22,960
I got it

2525
03:46:23,840 --> 03:46:27,360
Yeah, one is a complete game. I don't know much content about two

2526
03:46:29,760 --> 03:46:31,760
Uh

2527
03:46:32,000 --> 03:46:35,520
I'm slinging rancher. Well, all those twitter pics. We know how well you can

2528
03:46:36,240 --> 03:46:40,240
They some slime. Oh, that's really good. Hold on you get

2529
03:46:42,800 --> 03:46:45,600
You get a little laughter at that one. That was a good one. I like that one

2530
03:46:48,000 --> 03:46:50,000
Frozen lakes are a death trap. Yeah, that's true

2531
03:46:50,800 --> 03:46:53,840
I don't know if people don't like act like the ice can't just like

2532
03:46:54,400 --> 03:46:57,440
Do you know the shock to your system of going from

2533
03:46:58,640 --> 03:47:00,640
Like fine to frozen

2534
03:47:00,640 --> 03:47:02,640
It's like

2535
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:06,320
Apparently you can actually have heart attacks going in cold enough water

2536
03:47:06,960 --> 03:47:12,160
And because your body has such a shock that like it can't even pump the blood properly. It's like what have you done?

2537
03:47:14,240 --> 03:47:16,240
I think it's this way

2538
03:47:16,960 --> 03:47:20,880
You know, it's good strong. He was good refland clean

2539
03:47:21,760 --> 03:47:26,400
I'm afraid of the water already being submerged in a frozen deep is a nightmare scenario. Literally

2540
03:47:27,360 --> 03:47:36,640
Did you know apparently you can't get in trouble in quicksand, but a green silo is way worse than quicksand

2541
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:46,560
I'm hearing voices. Ah, ah, he got me. He got me

2542
03:47:48,800 --> 03:47:51,300
Okay, I might get take a little hydration

2543
03:47:56,720 --> 03:47:58,720
Wow

2544
03:47:58,880 --> 03:48:01,040
Little death by temperature shock. Yes

2545
03:48:03,440 --> 03:48:05,440
Hold on. I got it

2546
03:48:06,320 --> 03:48:08,720
Yes, he he he look at my inbox

2547
03:48:10,640 --> 03:48:14,320
I wonder if there's a sniper court game that would be fun

2548
03:48:15,760 --> 03:48:22,000
We can be elite snappers together. We we're sneaking around I can smell you

2549
03:48:22,560 --> 03:48:24,560
Oh

2550
03:48:26,960 --> 03:48:30,880
Real yard, and they need pulleys

2551
03:48:33,600 --> 03:48:35,600
Sorry, that was a voice line

2552
03:48:36,800 --> 03:48:40,240
That's the first time I've ever had a voice line uh on stream. Who is it?

2553
03:48:45,200 --> 03:48:47,200
But I do want to kiss in general

2554
03:48:52,000 --> 03:48:54,000
Okay, we got it. We got it bonk

2555
03:49:02,560 --> 03:49:07,200
Okay, we're aim button we're aim button. We're hacking we're slashing we're slashing we're hacking

2556
03:49:08,560 --> 03:49:10,560
We're playing sombra. We're playing sombra

2557
03:49:13,840 --> 03:49:15,840
No, it was a spawn point

2558
03:49:15,920 --> 03:49:21,280
I wish they would put little secrets at the end of spawn points because I always go exploring for the wrong reason

2559
03:49:22,800 --> 03:49:24,800
Hmm

2560
03:49:25,120 --> 03:49:29,120
Okay, the bomb a wagon. What do we do with it? Who?

2561
03:49:30,480 --> 03:49:32,480
Go bomb a wagon

2562
03:49:33,280 --> 03:49:35,280
No, they went through them

2563
03:49:36,320 --> 03:49:38,320
Her overwashed brain was kicking in already

2564
03:49:47,600 --> 03:49:50,720
What we have to find another path

2565
03:49:50,960 --> 03:49:55,920
Let me through. Why would you not make this out of wood? Why stone?

2566
03:49:58,640 --> 03:50:01,760
I'm spamming it, but we genuinely have to go all the way around

2567
03:50:02,880 --> 03:50:04,880
Round the outside round the outside

2568
03:50:07,200 --> 03:50:09,200
Let me add

2569
03:50:10,880 --> 03:50:15,360
Okay, I guess they made a path they will render. I thought we were tight. We're gonna have to backtrack

2570
03:50:15,440 --> 03:50:19,680
I was like, oh vermin tight don't normally make you backtrack through sections like that

2571
03:50:20,400 --> 03:50:23,680
But I was mistaken. I was foolish in my assumptions

2572
03:50:24,800 --> 03:50:27,680
How could I judge so eagerly that I what I did not know?

2573
03:50:33,200 --> 03:50:35,200
Wow

2574
03:50:37,520 --> 03:50:40,560
No game looks so fun, but I know nothing about 40k

2575
03:50:41,680 --> 03:50:45,120
I don't know nothing about either the refunds are telling me what it's all about

2576
03:50:45,920 --> 03:50:47,920
apparently it's in a different

2577
03:50:48,640 --> 03:50:51,120
Like alternative universe to the spacemen

2578
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:58,400
And the reason why it's called warhammer 40k because it's the year 40 thousand

2579
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:04,400
And that's why there's like space guns and stuff and it's so advanced. This is a bit in

2580
03:51:05,120 --> 03:51:07,280
um

2581
03:51:07,280 --> 03:51:08,880
And all that jazz

2582
03:51:08,880 --> 03:51:10,880
And but this universe

2583
03:51:11,520 --> 03:51:15,920
Is like not right. This is like way in the past, but it's not quite the same universe or something

2584
03:51:16,880 --> 03:51:22,560
It's very grim and dark. Yes, and there's no happy endings like literally not one happy ending

2585
03:51:26,080 --> 03:51:29,360
Stairs refling stairs. I say that as if I wasn't the one most um

2586
03:51:31,120 --> 03:51:36,080
The yeah nothing ends happy everything's like death and misery

2587
03:51:36,880 --> 03:51:40,480
Because I was that I was asking those who are into 40k. I'm like, oh

2588
03:51:41,120 --> 03:51:46,800
Like do you get excited when something new comes out and then it dawned on me if everything's depressing and sad

2589
03:51:47,440 --> 03:51:50,880
Like so when something new gets released you're not just like oh, that's

2590
03:51:51,440 --> 03:51:56,480
Like oh, I can't wait to strap in for another uh depressing storyline basically

2591
03:51:57,440 --> 03:51:59,440
um

2592
03:51:59,600 --> 03:52:06,960
40k is alternative in september a big new game is coming out. Is that so she remembered? Yeah, I listen to you

2593
03:52:07,680 --> 03:52:08,880
I

2594
03:52:08,880 --> 03:52:13,600
Like death 40k is a spin-off warhammer fantasy is the one you're playing is the main one wait

2595
03:52:15,200 --> 03:52:19,280
40 keys the spin-off, but it got more popular

2596
03:52:26,720 --> 03:52:31,920
Um, I don't break the chain on the oh

2597
03:52:33,360 --> 03:52:35,360
and

2598
03:52:37,840 --> 03:52:43,040
What's more depressing is how games workshop handles their IPs. Oh

2599
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:46,960
It's not good

2600
03:52:46,960 --> 03:52:48,960
Thank you the beauty lord for the

2601
03:52:49,520 --> 03:52:50,640
Yep

2602
03:52:50,640 --> 03:52:52,640
Sorry, I'm getting annihilated. I need to be blocking

2603
03:52:53,440 --> 03:52:55,440
I need to be blocking

2604
03:52:55,440 --> 03:52:57,440
But I'm just taking on like a full hard myself

2605
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:01,520
40k is just pure edgy darkness. No happiness

2606
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:05,280
If you don't die peaceful to death you just becomes

2607
03:53:06,240 --> 03:53:08,240
What you swore to destroy

2608
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:10,560
geez

2609
03:53:12,240 --> 03:53:16,880
I'm trying to like read. I'm just swinging into the void. Okay. I'm trying reading this stuff. It's not wait. What I do

2610
03:53:17,440 --> 03:53:19,440
That's not the flying

2611
03:53:21,200 --> 03:53:23,200
I don't

2612
03:53:23,920 --> 03:53:26,480
Okay, I'm gonna just let the refunds deal with what we're supposed to do

2613
03:53:27,600 --> 03:53:29,600
Make an anti-chote

2614
03:53:29,920 --> 03:53:33,040
Make a cheese and ham if you've got ham I had cheese and ham you'll figure

2615
03:53:34,000 --> 03:53:36,000
I

2616
03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:38,560
What are I doing?

2617
03:53:40,240 --> 03:53:42,720
I'm protecting this refill and I'm helping. I'm totally helping

2618
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:51,280
How they keep getting swings on me that I'm not expecting

2619
03:53:56,960 --> 03:54:00,560
Um, right chain I'm to break a chain

2620
03:54:01,440 --> 03:54:05,200
Warhammer invented the term groom dart

2621
03:54:06,720 --> 03:54:10,560
That's what I'm saying. It's like, oh, I can't wait for this new thing to drop from the franchise

2622
03:54:10,960 --> 03:54:14,080
And it's just like oh another depressing plot storyline

2623
03:54:19,040 --> 03:54:23,600
But I'm having a cheese and a tickle over because I'm literally playing before anyone's like, oh my god, strong

2624
03:54:23,600 --> 03:54:28,000
Are you little here? I'm literally playing the game right now. Please relax. I'm literally playing one of their franchises

2625
03:54:28,400 --> 03:54:30,400
Relax

2626
03:54:31,360 --> 03:54:36,960
I will send you I lost the air. I will send you to the island. Oh, I found a chain. I'm helping

2627
03:54:39,760 --> 03:54:41,280
That keeps

2628
03:54:41,280 --> 03:54:43,280
I did it. I held

2629
03:54:43,680 --> 03:54:44,800
Now what?

2630
03:54:44,800 --> 03:54:47,440
Oh, we go back to the bomb wagons after all that

2631
03:54:48,480 --> 03:54:52,560
That was quite the same quest. I'm not gonna lie. That was quite the same quest to do that

2632
03:54:52,720 --> 03:54:54,720
But

2633
03:54:56,240 --> 03:54:58,240
I'm shadowboxing out the wazoo

2634
03:54:58,960 --> 03:55:01,680
Fantasy hammer has been destroyed by GW almost

2635
03:55:02,400 --> 03:55:06,240
Two decades now end times you're playing now is the tail end of it

2636
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:11,600
They are bringing it back due to pc game popularity. Yes

2637
03:55:13,040 --> 03:55:17,360
Pull the lever Frank. Ow the door just collapsed on me

2638
03:55:23,120 --> 03:55:25,120
I

2639
03:55:25,680 --> 03:55:27,680
Am the bone wagon

2640
03:55:28,000 --> 03:55:30,720
That's why they have the orc orc is the comedy really

2641
03:55:31,360 --> 03:55:36,000
Grimdark world didn't exist before war hammer for a key. It looks like clary is the word

2642
03:55:36,800 --> 03:55:38,800
I'd like to play

2643
03:55:42,640 --> 03:55:45,680
Total war hammer is really carrying fantasy

2644
03:55:46,400 --> 03:55:48,400
Oh

2645
03:55:51,280 --> 03:55:55,280
I mean, I thought this was a well-made game, but maybe this is like their only well-made game

2646
03:55:58,400 --> 03:56:00,400
What now

2647
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:10,000
Oh, we ignite it run away replays, but we can still oh skip shit. Okay. That's scary

2648
03:56:16,000 --> 03:56:24,160
So I might throw if you heard that it got frog in my foot. Can we see it from here? I hope we're out safe this time

2649
03:56:28,480 --> 03:56:30,480
That was it

2650
03:56:39,120 --> 03:56:41,120
Where's the bridge

2651
03:56:41,120 --> 03:56:43,120
I

2652
03:56:50,400 --> 03:56:52,400
It's over here

2653
03:56:55,680 --> 03:56:57,680
Stand up shut up

2654
03:57:01,120 --> 03:57:05,680
Kind of anti-climactic it literally it's like get out of there 20 seconds to run away

2655
03:57:11,760 --> 03:57:13,760
Maybe my

2656
03:57:32,080 --> 03:57:37,760
Okay, we did it we did it we did it what's that three more

2659
03:58:06,000 --> 03:58:10,320
Orcs literally our funk is he thinks from your heart enough makes him do other worldly stuff

2660
03:58:11,040 --> 03:58:13,040
Me for real for real

2661
03:58:15,440 --> 03:58:17,440
Let me be your frog

2662
03:58:19,040 --> 03:58:21,040
Remember the time to play sonic heroes and then I go tell them

2663
03:58:34,400 --> 03:58:38,800
Escape through the bridge of shadows we did it

2664
03:58:40,880 --> 03:58:43,440
Okay, yes, okay, we made it we made it

2665
03:58:45,280 --> 03:58:48,240
I'll be the butterflies in your stomach. Oh, that's pretty good

2666
03:58:49,680 --> 03:58:51,680
I need a round of applause

2667
03:58:55,520 --> 03:59:02,320
Why didn't juji thank you team lasagna eating rabies infected fox drawn from memory

2668
03:59:02,720 --> 03:59:04,720
Yay

2669
03:59:06,320 --> 03:59:10,000
That reminds me of a joke a question rather what did Cinderella see

2670
03:59:10,560 --> 03:59:13,680
Stop that's all right. All right. Go on then go on then

2671
03:59:14,880 --> 03:59:18,320
Reflings what did Cinderella see when she got to the ball?

2672
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:26,400
Anyone anyone at all are you not sure

2673
03:59:32,800 --> 03:59:37,680
A classic if you will

2674
03:59:42,400 --> 03:59:44,400
Yeah

2675
03:59:44,560 --> 03:59:49,600
Time to put a stitch she gags she too. Yep. Yeah, yeah, you putting two and two together

2676
03:59:50,960 --> 03:59:52,960
headshot

2677
03:59:56,080 --> 04:00:00,960
Uh get it because she Cinderella got to the ball

2678
04:00:02,640 --> 04:00:04,960
Dang, I just joined and got gawk gawked on site

2679
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:14,000
Are you squidding me right now?

2680
04:00:15,040 --> 04:00:21,360
Made a bet that I'd give you $50 and sub if you could put me under during one of your asmr streams

2681
04:00:21,920 --> 04:00:27,360
It's never happened before so surely this was a safe bet. Here's your $50

2682
04:00:28,080 --> 04:00:30,080
I

2683
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:32,400
Made a bet that what

2684
04:00:32,400 --> 04:00:37,200
Pika only thank you. We've what made a bet that I'd give you 50

2685
04:00:38,320 --> 04:00:43,360
And subscribe if you could put me under during one of your asmr streams

2686
04:00:44,800 --> 04:00:46,880
Damn really

2687
04:00:50,880 --> 04:00:52,880
I think it means the hypnosis one

2688
04:00:53,200 --> 04:00:55,200
Thank you

2689
04:00:56,400 --> 04:01:00,000
Hopefully I can do you justice this week because I've got to forget your name one

2690
04:01:00,880 --> 04:01:03,600
But I'm going to try and make it really comforting and reassuring

2691
04:01:04,560 --> 04:01:07,200
Man both one and lost real answer

2692
04:01:08,880 --> 04:01:10,880
Real answer

2693
04:01:12,480 --> 04:01:14,720
Mummy's gambling behind her pants

2694
04:01:16,640 --> 04:01:20,480
Yeah, thank you again Pika Ollie. I didn't expect that but yes, um

2695
04:01:21,440 --> 04:01:26,720
Maybe yes, uh, I I'm doing I forget your name

2696
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:32,720
The joke is better when preform through action not words

2697
04:01:38,000 --> 04:01:40,000
Thank you the booty

2698
04:01:41,200 --> 04:01:44,560
What's my name again? What's my name? No, it's going to be a comfort and like

2699
04:01:45,440 --> 04:01:50,080
Um, you're going to take on the name of reefing and what reefing means to me

2700
04:01:51,200 --> 04:01:54,480
Like I'm going to make it really lovey-dovey in terms of like

2701
04:01:55,200 --> 04:01:57,200
reefing to me means like

2702
04:01:57,600 --> 04:02:04,320
A source of love like a source of comfort a source of accepting and like we both want to do it towards each other

2703
04:02:05,200 --> 04:02:10,800
Um and offer that towards each other like that's what I'm going to try and angle the hypnosis to

2704
04:02:11,600 --> 04:02:16,800
My only concern is that it's not going to be too long

2705
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:21,360
That's my only concern. But as I said any, um

2706
04:02:22,480 --> 04:02:24,480
Like ASMR script

2707
04:02:25,520 --> 04:02:27,520
um

2708
04:02:27,600 --> 04:02:29,360
Sorry, uh, any

2709
04:02:29,360 --> 04:02:34,480
Hypnosis streams will be turned into like full-blown role plays. So you could so there's no like

2710
04:02:35,120 --> 04:02:39,760
Having to deal with any mistakes errors or things that I've said that weren't quite on par with the script

2711
04:02:40,000 --> 04:02:42,000
Um, I will make them actual videos

2712
04:02:42,960 --> 04:02:46,320
I was Johnny's favorite weapon the glock glock 19

2713
04:02:48,480 --> 04:02:55,680
She's gonna make me have an identity crisis. No, no, no, no, it's only temporary you only forget your name until I'm done with you

2714
04:02:58,480 --> 04:03:04,320
I I it's even if it doesn't like bring you back if that makes sense like I'm

2715
04:03:05,280 --> 04:03:10,240
Setting it so you will like go. I'll come back into those. I'm not making it long at all

2716
04:03:11,360 --> 04:03:13,360
My name for refling, of course

2717
04:03:14,320 --> 04:03:16,240
and

2718
04:03:16,240 --> 04:03:22,080
But hear me out. What if I don't want to remember? Oh, but that's your identity your name. That's who you are

2719
04:03:23,920 --> 04:03:27,280
She's gonna make me have a temporary identity crisis

2720
04:03:27,280 --> 04:03:29,280
Career

2721
04:03:29,520 --> 04:03:33,840
I've not played any other character. I might I'm maybe the fire lady. I might want to play

2722
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:39,440
But if I've swapped to her I assume I lose everything wait wait

2723
04:03:41,200 --> 04:03:45,200
Overcharge increases spell charge up increase range damage

2724
04:03:46,240 --> 04:03:51,680
Fire walk teleport after not casting spell do sure. Why not? I'll try a new hero

2725
04:03:53,120 --> 04:03:55,120
So what

2726
04:03:55,200 --> 04:03:57,200
Is the magic like unlimited

2727
04:04:04,480 --> 04:04:12,000
Is the magic unlimited is there any reflins who are wanting a spot that hasn't had a shot yet? I think maybe you'll

2728
04:04:13,840 --> 04:04:15,840
But when I've won

2729
04:04:19,520 --> 04:04:21,520
Are you squidding me right now

2730
04:04:22,480 --> 04:04:26,240
My name is my name is my name is John Cena

2731
04:04:30,560 --> 04:04:32,560
If the bar goes fully hurt myself

2732
04:04:47,280 --> 04:04:49,280
Wait that doesn't hurt me

2733
04:04:50,000 --> 04:04:56,560
That doesn't or can I not it would that hurt me in game. Thank you the booty lord. Thank john Cena

2734
04:04:59,120 --> 04:05:03,280
Internet basil fail. Thank you chat. It's like you're using the shared brain cell. I mean

2735
04:05:04,480 --> 04:05:06,480
something

2736
04:05:06,480 --> 04:05:08,480
It does be don't see you you're on fire

2737
04:05:13,040 --> 04:05:15,040
I cast fireball

2738
04:05:15,200 --> 04:05:20,160
What's that dungeon master? I'm in an enclosed area. I cast fireball

2739
04:05:21,440 --> 04:05:23,440
Mama, I know your tricks

2740
04:05:23,440 --> 04:05:26,480
You said the effects only last until you're done with us

2741
04:05:26,960 --> 04:05:31,840
But the truth is that you're never done with us or therefore all hypno streams are permanent

2742
04:05:32,320 --> 04:05:34,320
Whether we remember or not

2743
04:05:34,960 --> 04:05:36,960
I would not do anything

2744
04:05:38,960 --> 04:05:40,960
Uh

2745
04:05:40,960 --> 04:05:42,960
Everything that I wonder

2746
04:05:43,920 --> 04:05:46,480
Are you you're in the prologue refling

2747
04:05:47,680 --> 04:05:54,880
You're in the pro role pro role. Why are you playing like that prologue? You've not played this game before refling

2748
04:05:56,480 --> 04:05:59,280
I don't want you to force the play it

2749
04:06:02,800 --> 04:06:04,160
I mean

2750
04:06:04,160 --> 04:06:07,920
You you could just kind of you could okay this reflin hasn't had a shot

2751
04:06:07,920 --> 04:06:11,440
Is there any reflings that want to stake a claim that they've not played with me?

2752
04:06:12,480 --> 04:06:14,480
um

2753
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:19,600
All right, I'm sorry. Let me just judge your games it fall out new vegas. Okay shapes two

2754
04:06:20,640 --> 04:06:24,080
What shapes two? Sorry. I need to judge this refling immediately

2755
04:06:24,880 --> 04:06:27,600
shapes two what game are you playing?

2756
04:06:27,760 --> 04:06:29,760
Oh

2757
04:06:35,840 --> 04:06:40,080
That game, okay, do you not think you should work to control your

2758
04:06:42,000 --> 04:06:44,000
I want to have a shot but now that

2759
04:06:49,760 --> 04:06:52,880
I hate that I played this game most on a sports and forgot all characters

2760
04:06:53,040 --> 04:07:00,080
Mayflies death to all except their own eagles if there's no new we fling then

2761
04:07:01,760 --> 04:07:03,760
Oh unless

2762
04:07:03,760 --> 04:07:08,240
Okay, there we go. Got it. We got a team. Yes. I think that's all the reflings now

2763
04:07:08,880 --> 04:07:12,640
That wanted to play which honestly maybe works out

2764
04:07:13,600 --> 04:07:19,200
Better because I was actually worried I was gonna run out but as I said we are stream sniping during the week

2765
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:22,160
Which helps

2766
04:07:22,960 --> 04:07:24,960
I know for you

2767
04:07:25,840 --> 04:07:27,840
We have a decent thingy

2768
04:07:28,320 --> 04:07:31,040
Are you telling them to leave? Who to leave? No one

2769
04:07:33,120 --> 04:07:35,120
No way you're new to this game

2770
04:07:35,760 --> 04:07:40,160
Reef fling are you why would you buy this game because of me your level one?

2771
04:07:41,360 --> 04:07:43,360
Reef

2772
04:07:44,560 --> 04:07:46,640
No reflin are you

2773
04:07:47,600 --> 04:07:49,600
Maybe you've played it before

2774
04:07:51,920 --> 04:07:56,160
At least it was on sale reflin. Do you even know what you're gonna do?

2775
04:07:58,560 --> 04:08:01,520
I don't know. He's hopefully you've played before

2776
04:08:02,640 --> 04:08:04,640
He's smurfing

2777
04:08:05,760 --> 04:08:07,760
Got to play with mommy it's worth

2779
04:08:16,640 --> 04:08:18,640

04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:20,880
This is gonna be into

2781
04:08:20,960 --> 04:08:24,160
Your level isn't high enough for me. Here's some more

2782
04:08:25,200 --> 04:08:29,120
Oh, you played on xbox before. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it

2783
04:08:31,440 --> 04:08:33,200
Oh, no

2784
04:08:33,200 --> 04:08:38,160
What happened? I'm the host. What do you mean broken connection? It's my connection

2785
04:08:40,160 --> 04:08:42,160
Am I still online?

2786
04:08:42,160 --> 04:08:44,160
Huh

2787
04:08:47,920 --> 04:08:52,720
Have I been banned banned for getting carry am I still online?

2788
04:08:56,000 --> 04:09:00,640
Wait steam just broke. No, don't know when I'm streaming. Are you serious?

2789
04:09:02,880 --> 04:09:09,280
Wait, no, it's offline. Are you serious? We're almost

2790
04:09:09,440 --> 04:09:16,400
Been it. Wait, how long does it go down for? Can I stall? How long am I allowed to stall for? How long does it take?

2791
04:09:20,800 --> 04:09:26,720
Is it like 15 minutes or like Tuesday's a maintenance date not long

2792
04:09:28,640 --> 04:09:30,640

2805
04:10:20,560 --> 04:10:22,560
I could make a deal

2806
04:10:25,840 --> 04:10:27,840
Hmm

2807
04:10:28,800 --> 04:10:30,800
Damn bathy

2808
04:10:31,600 --> 04:10:35,360
I'll read some marshmallows and we'll try if it doesn't work

2809
04:10:35,760 --> 04:10:42,240
What we'll do is we'll wrap up fermentation very quickly in another stream. What am I doing for the rest of the week?

2810
04:10:43,280 --> 04:10:45,280
I know i'm doing black ops one

2811
04:10:50,960 --> 04:10:55,600
I can't believe that oh we're doing tavern master tomorrow, which is really short

2812
04:10:57,840 --> 04:11:05,120
Maybe on the peggle stream pegs all over you. Um

2813
04:11:07,680 --> 04:11:08,880

04:11:08,880 --> 04:11:10,880
Thor man do all my energy

2815
04:11:11,360 --> 04:11:13,360
And she has eyes bigger than a panda

2816
04:11:15,040 --> 04:11:19,280
I like I don't get all the secret world tavern master into vermin side

2817
04:11:20,720 --> 04:11:22,720
The last two maintenance six ten minutes

2818
04:11:24,160 --> 04:11:25,920
I'll read

2819
04:11:26,000 --> 04:11:29,360
Marshmallows to the dramatic vermin tide audio in the background. Okay

2820
04:11:30,560 --> 04:11:34,240
I can't believe I picked maintenance day. How could I have no thought about that?

2821
04:11:35,840 --> 04:11:40,000
Stream broke mommy. I kiss you make you feel better. Look, I can't believe I was so dumb

2822
04:11:42,560 --> 04:11:44,400
Um

2823
04:11:44,400 --> 04:11:47,440
I refling and chat said not to tell you so

2824
04:11:48,560 --> 04:11:50,560
Here is the story of

2825
04:11:51,440 --> 04:11:58,800
Nickle the bomb grog. It's important to know the grots are like

2826
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:06,320
Tiny weak pathetic cowardly orcs and they get abused and treated like garbage by the orcs and forced to do all the tedious and meaningless work

2827
04:12:06,880 --> 04:12:11,840
Sometimes they're killed or eaten for no reason orcs only respect strength and size and scaling combat

2828
04:12:11,840 --> 04:12:14,320
They live for war and their idea of fun is a good scrap

2829
04:12:15,040 --> 04:12:17,040
and

2830
04:12:17,440 --> 04:12:22,960
Slid the last few meters to the fuel tank and crawled underneath as rounds pinged off the metal above them

2831
04:12:23,280 --> 04:12:30,400
He proceeded exactly as the boss had told him planted the wiry thing press the big red button and wait until the tickly

2832
04:12:30,560 --> 04:12:32,480
Oh the ticking stops

2833
04:12:32,480 --> 04:12:34,960
He couldn't help but smile to himself at job well done

2834
04:12:35,040 --> 04:12:39,840
Maybe when he got back to base the boys would finally be nice, but he nuked himself

2835
04:12:41,280 --> 04:12:43,280
And he didn't know

2836
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:46,000
Oh

2837
04:12:46,720 --> 04:12:53,040
He nuked himself and he didn't realize all he wanted to do is be accepted for a little guy

2838
04:13:01,360 --> 04:13:07,520
Oh munching on strony's pheromone maxed moth. No, don't type that refling. What was that? Don't make me read that

2839
04:13:08,880 --> 04:13:10,880
Don't make me read that

2840
04:13:11,040 --> 04:13:13,040
um

2841
04:13:13,200 --> 04:13:15,200
Literally, you know

2842
04:13:16,640 --> 04:13:18,640
a

2843
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:21,600
Uh

2844
04:13:21,680 --> 04:13:23,840
The grimest of all the grim

2845
04:13:26,160 --> 04:13:30,800
One thing about the orcs is that for them seeing each other explode is peak comedy

2846
04:13:32,320 --> 04:13:34,720
Hmm. I know it's Tuesday. I know

2847
04:13:35,440 --> 04:13:40,240
I'm gonna I'm gonna see if I can stall enough for the servers to boot back online so we can finish

2848
04:13:41,120 --> 04:13:43,120
um

2849
04:13:43,360 --> 04:13:45,360
That's annoying

2850
04:13:45,520 --> 04:13:49,360
You have made my life better with your bubbly energy and your asmr

2851
04:13:49,360 --> 04:13:53,760
The asmr has helped me get to sleep watching your students and boys have helped me get back into a better headspace

2852
04:13:53,760 --> 04:13:56,960
Keep doing what you're doing. Much love and appreciation. Ah much love too, reethlin

2853
04:13:57,360 --> 04:13:59,360
I'm glad you can enjoy it. It's

2854
04:13:59,600 --> 04:14:04,800
It's really nice people being like, oh I'll get a lot out of your content. I'm like, I'm just being me. What the heck?

2855
04:14:04,960 --> 04:14:08,640
I'm you're doing my thing, but I'm glad you can get a lot out of it because

2856
04:14:09,360 --> 04:14:12,880
It is just fucking gibberish half the time like honestly like

2857
04:14:13,600 --> 04:14:18,720
If you want to boil it down, I just come out with anaheem and everhin

2858
04:14:20,240 --> 04:14:22,240
Don't make no sense

2859
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:25,600
But maybe that's the fun part

2860
04:14:28,880 --> 04:14:30,880
For some reason

2861
04:14:31,840 --> 04:14:33,840
I

2862
04:14:42,080 --> 04:14:45,280
Have it's marshmallow different from chat. Just curious as to how you feel about

2863
04:14:46,000 --> 04:14:52,160
Oh marshmallow is people like anonymously can type what they're thinking whereas chat some people feel a bit like

2864
04:14:53,200 --> 04:14:58,640
Oh, she can see me. I'm embarrassed and I don't want to type and like I know there's also a lot of like lurking reeflings

2865
04:14:58,640 --> 04:15:04,240
That don't like typing and I don't want them to feel like forced. I'm like one of those shimmers that are like, oh my god

2866
04:15:04,800 --> 04:15:06,800
You've not typed anything

2867
04:15:07,680 --> 04:15:12,720
Like I don't know what you're complaining about if someone just wants to chill in the background. Let them chill. Jeez

2868
04:15:14,160 --> 04:15:16,160
Jeez

2869
04:15:20,720 --> 04:15:24,320
She's making it all up on the fly. She has no idea. No, I don't and it's going well

2870
04:15:24,400 --> 04:15:31,200
Um, you're in my chat and not talking to me. She won't she's shadow box and shadows get

2871
04:15:32,560 --> 04:15:34,720
Guys she has a gun to my head. She's forcing me to type

2872
04:15:36,320 --> 04:15:38,320
Chat reeflings. I'm h word

2873
04:15:39,600 --> 04:15:41,600
On main h word on main

2874
04:15:41,600 --> 04:15:47,520
The sequel to the pregnancy video doesn't have to be childbirthy silly sausage. Hey wait, I say silly sausage

2875
04:15:48,160 --> 04:15:50,160
It could just be something sweet

2876
04:15:50,160 --> 04:15:56,000
Like singing lullabies to put a newborn asleep with some more positive affirmations or maybe you can bath and clean us

2877
04:15:56,000 --> 04:15:58,000
I just need more mommy's Johnny

2878
04:15:58,080 --> 04:16:01,120
Honestly, the bathing one's really cute. I think that's adorable

2879
04:16:03,120 --> 04:16:06,800
Because it would have nice water sounds in it and like bubble sounds and stuff

2880
04:16:08,000 --> 04:16:10,000
Oh, that's cute

2881
04:16:10,240 --> 04:16:15,440
Oh, it's quite Disney. Oh, no. I might just have to do that. Oh, you've done it now

2882
04:16:20,880 --> 04:16:26,000
Hey, Johnny, your brain was infecting me because I've started to say real and true. Oh, I need to stop it

2883
04:16:33,360 --> 04:16:35,360
Oh, that was a big yawn

2884
04:16:36,320 --> 04:16:38,320
Did you sleep well?

2885
04:16:38,560 --> 04:16:40,560
Are you tossing and turning?

2886
04:16:41,040 --> 04:16:44,000
You've been tossing and turning a lot in your sleep, baby

2887
04:16:44,960 --> 04:16:46,960
Okay

2888
04:16:47,360 --> 04:16:51,040
You've got a stinky nappy. Okay time to put you in the bath

2889
04:16:52,240 --> 04:16:57,760
Where did real and true come from? And there's this really famous twitch clip

2890
04:16:59,040 --> 04:17:04,800
And the guy was on cocaine. Are you squidding me right now? Sorry. I don't know why that's I mean it came in

2891
04:17:04,800 --> 04:17:09,920
Then you have reeflings like me who say the most out of pocket stuff mods come at me

2892
04:17:10,640 --> 04:17:12,640
No, my mods are good

2893
04:17:13,360 --> 04:17:19,440
They're or asking the girls like what do you want from your mods just in case they're missing

2894
04:17:20,480 --> 04:17:24,560
Um, and obviously I got asked to because it was management that was handling it

2895
04:17:25,440 --> 04:17:28,080
And it was like do you have any notes for your mods? And I'm like, no

2896
04:17:28,880 --> 04:17:30,640
mods are fine

2897
04:17:30,640 --> 04:17:36,800
They get my level of humor they get that you can get away with a lot more in my chat than the average like streamer would get away with

2898
04:17:37,520 --> 04:17:39,520
The mods got them. Wait

2899
04:17:40,240 --> 04:17:41,920
Oh

2900
04:17:41,920 --> 04:17:44,480
The but hey lord, thank you for the super chat

2901
04:17:44,560 --> 04:17:48,880
But I mean you did dare the mods to be fair and you know

2902
04:17:50,400 --> 04:17:52,400
And the mods challenging

2903
04:17:56,480 --> 04:18:02,080
I started saying she vala, which literally means who goes there after a burp

2904
04:18:02,880 --> 04:18:04,480
she vala

2905
04:18:04,480 --> 04:18:06,480
she vala

2906
04:18:06,960 --> 04:18:09,360
Mods nah had win. Oh fuck with the boy

2907
04:18:10,160 --> 04:18:14,880
I assume it was a timeout not a pair of my band, right? Sure one couple 10 10 seconds

2908
04:18:18,320 --> 04:18:24,640
Release my boy. He didn't do anything. I'm worthy sacrifice. What are you gonna do ink me? Yes. In fact, I will

2909
04:18:37,040 --> 04:18:42,000
Why did the mods lurk? Oh the mods aren't to talk

2910
04:18:43,920 --> 04:18:49,520
They've been silenced mods don't talk the only time mods talk is to link when another girl goes live

2911
04:18:51,040 --> 04:18:53,840
Hey another video girl go live

2912
04:18:55,520 --> 04:19:00,400
That's why like if there's a miss input on a mods message they delete it instantly

2913
04:19:02,000 --> 04:19:04,000
Because they're not to talk because

2914
04:19:06,960 --> 04:19:08,960
As they should

2915
04:19:08,960 --> 04:19:10,960
And they do it for free. They do

2916
04:19:11,920 --> 04:19:15,440
Key vala. Sorry English then are a bit the same

2917
04:19:16,160 --> 04:19:18,160
Key vala

2918
04:19:18,160 --> 04:19:22,160
Who goes there? It's back online. Oh my god. I stalled enough

2919
04:19:23,280 --> 04:19:25,280
Reflang did you prank me?

04:19:28,720 --> 04:19:30,720
Reflang did you prank me?

2921
04:19:31,280 --> 04:19:33,280
Oh

2922
04:19:35,280 --> 04:19:40,080
Oh, hold on a minute. You didn't prank me. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. We're getting there

2923
04:19:40,640 --> 04:19:45,760
Oh my god, it says I'm in beach trip studio. I can't believe it. I can't believe you just found out I'm in beach trip studio. Oh

2924
04:19:47,280 --> 04:19:53,520
Okay, okay. Now originally the team was made of peppermint dot gar and lany boy

2925
04:19:54,400 --> 04:19:58,080
No, I'm not being advertised so go away already. I'm locked the DLC apparently

2926
04:20:01,040 --> 04:20:03,040
If anyone has a claim

2927
04:20:06,320 --> 04:20:07,520
Uh

2928
04:20:07,520 --> 04:20:13,120
Then lany you're being substituted not prostitute substituted and

2929
04:20:14,880 --> 04:20:18,320
No, the advert is literally in-game advert and I sat and watched it thinking oh

2930
04:20:24,320 --> 04:20:29,520
I started I had an interesting idea for something but I forgot what it was because I was half asleep and I forgot to make a

2931
04:20:29,520 --> 04:20:31,920
No, I'll just say that. I love you. That's funny is anything

2932
04:20:34,160 --> 04:20:36,160
Someone sent me

2933

Someone sent me I I'm smitten and that's it and it's a photo

2934

And I need to comfort your response and I alt tab to the void and try to type a supportive message

2941
04:21:11,440 --> 04:21:18,800
But it's just the void not live. Why I'm so cute. Oh, are you trying to comfort me in the past? I promise everything's okay. I'm having a good time

2942
04:21:19,120 --> 04:21:21,120
Oh

2943
04:21:22,640 --> 04:21:24,640
Mommy's pimping out a reform

2944
04:21:27,200 --> 04:21:31,840
We are dj's here. We openly tell strony who wanted to artwork us. I mean, you know

Um, you already

You already see that you're a bit more energetic with some

2951
04:22:06,480 --> 04:22:09,440
Older streams on her. Wait. I'm more energetic now

2952
04:22:10,880 --> 04:22:14,240
I feel like the the exhaustion hadn't hit on the older streams yet

2953
04:22:14,960 --> 04:22:19,680
Stream steam level zero pathetic. Don't laugh at my zero

2954
04:22:20,240 --> 04:22:22,240
my zero interest

2955
04:22:22,640 --> 04:22:27,600
Okay, is it working? Okay, you were oh, no, you can't come in. Why not?

2956
04:22:29,920 --> 04:22:33,360
I can invite you to watch have it that you can watch a stream within a stream

2957
04:22:36,240 --> 04:22:38,560
Maybe reboot the game I think I'm gonna have to

2958
04:22:39,120 --> 04:22:41,120
Hmm

2959
04:22:41,120 --> 04:22:48,000
Hold on. Let me do that and then let me go vermin tide and let me open up vermin tide again

2960
04:22:51,040 --> 04:22:53,040
Uh-huh

2961
04:22:54,000 --> 04:22:56,880
And then we open up vermin tide

2962
04:22:57,680 --> 04:22:59,680
I

2963
04:23:05,440 --> 04:23:08,720
Have to restart it open beta get out of here

2964
04:23:11,600 --> 04:23:17,120
Stop advertising to me when I'm trying to play a freaking game that I've already paid for enough with the advertisements

2965
04:23:18,160 --> 04:23:25,840
Anyway, now that we've established we hate advertisements. Did you know I have five lovely gen mates all of the uh

2966
04:23:26,560 --> 04:23:31,280
Fantastic streams differentiation. If you like a yapper, you know

2967
04:23:34,160 --> 04:23:36,720
Okay, it's a fishy what the heck

2968
04:23:38,800 --> 04:23:44,720
Okay, bloody bloody blah read before playing a very small percentage epileptic seizures

2969
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:50,400
I feel like if you have to put epileptic seizure

2970
04:23:51,680 --> 04:23:53,680
I've uh, I know that's rather

2971
04:23:54,240 --> 04:23:56,640
The first thing you know loading

2972
04:23:59,600 --> 04:24:02,160
Loading start game adventure

2973
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:05,440
Okay

2974
04:24:05,440 --> 04:24:07,440
No, no, don't advertise me

2975
04:24:09,120 --> 04:24:11,120
Don't care

2976
04:24:11,920 --> 04:24:15,920
Okay, I'm gonna try the fire lady because I ain't really mucked about with her yet

2977
04:24:16,480 --> 04:24:20,080
Can't let them know you score 20 10% off your gamer sub

2978
04:24:20,720 --> 04:24:25,200
Yeah, or any of the girls in that matter because we might be able to get a cup

2979
04:24:26,320 --> 04:24:29,680
And I will be doing terrible things to that cup in a photo shoot

2980
04:24:29,680 --> 04:24:34,960
And I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise because uh gamer subs is actually super cool and awesome and they don't care

2981
04:24:35,600 --> 04:24:39,840
And uh, they're like yep as long as you advertise it knock yourself out and I like oh, okay

2982
04:24:40,320 --> 04:24:43,920
Uh, I'll be putting that cup in between my cheeks lickety split that's awesome

2983
04:24:46,240 --> 04:24:48,240
Mm-hmm

2984
04:24:48,560 --> 04:24:52,560
Cup is going spelunking. Oh, I think it's too big

2985
04:24:58,400 --> 04:25:01,520
That will become see I can do it with my butt cheeks

2986
04:25:02,960 --> 04:25:04,960
Sheebie will do it with her boobas

2987
04:25:05,600 --> 04:25:07,760
And then we'll combine the photos together

2988
04:25:09,040 --> 04:25:11,040
And then it'll be perfect

2989
04:25:12,160 --> 04:25:14,160
That cup

2990
04:25:14,720 --> 04:25:18,480
I mean your tearless said that you like to be straight. How dare you bring that out?

2991
04:25:18,960 --> 04:25:20,960
I told that to you in confidence

2992
04:25:21,040 --> 04:25:24,880
You don't have to unlock suction or auction off the cups

2993
04:25:25,920 --> 04:25:30,160
Put the shaker between your cheeks and mix your drink by shaking your butt

2994
04:25:30,240 --> 04:25:35,760
If only if it worked like that, you already know I would do that. I'd be sorry. What are we talking about?

2995
04:25:36,240 --> 04:25:38,320
Uh, me being wildly inappropriate

2996
04:25:39,360 --> 04:25:41,360
Um

2997
04:25:41,680 --> 04:25:49,280
So gamer sups does energy drinks, but if you get like enough referrals like uh people who

2998
04:25:50,080 --> 04:25:51,920
like use your code

2999
04:25:51,920 --> 04:25:53,920
and they offer

3000
04:25:54,400 --> 04:25:57,360
What they call a waifu cup like your own design type thing

3001
04:25:57,920 --> 04:26:05,040
And I'm saying that if I did unlock the cup, I would essentially do the most inappropriate wild photo shoots with them

3002
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:11,280
Breaking news gamer sups seal skyrocket after collaboration with a feature of her company

3003
04:26:12,400 --> 04:26:14,400
Yeah, the thug shaking

3004
04:26:14,960 --> 04:26:16,960
I like the way she says perfect

3005
04:26:17,120 --> 04:26:19,120
How do you set perfect?

3006
04:26:19,280 --> 04:26:20,640
perfect

3007
04:26:20,640 --> 04:26:22,640
perfect

3008
04:26:22,640 --> 04:26:24,640
perfect

3009
04:26:24,720 --> 04:26:26,720
I don't know how you would say it in a different accent

3010
04:26:27,200 --> 04:26:32,880
Use the cake to mix cake mix in a cup. I think gamer sups actual drink powder you have to mix

3011
04:26:33,440 --> 04:26:35,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to mix it. So I'll do it with my butt

3012
04:26:36,480 --> 04:26:38,080
Okay

3013
04:26:38,080 --> 04:26:40,080
Right, this is our original team

3014
04:26:40,720 --> 04:26:45,280
We are called the disconnecters because we disconnected from the freaking servers

3015
04:26:47,440 --> 04:26:51,360
Okay, let's get Roy into the mission

3016
04:26:53,760 --> 04:26:55,760
We're doing

3017
04:27:00,320 --> 04:27:02,320
I don't know what any of that means

3018
04:27:02,640 --> 04:27:06,560
I'm just happy to be here and play the game together

3019
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:11,600
Gamer sups is like too late

3020
04:27:12,480 --> 04:27:14,960
No, she will be self-conscious of her. She says perfect

3021
04:27:16,160 --> 04:27:18,960
I'm not self-conscious. I'm just like did I really say that different?

3022
04:27:19,120 --> 04:27:23,200
But it's nice like we all have different accents than the way you see words in film

3023
04:27:25,520 --> 04:27:27,520
Oh a bush

3024
04:27:27,520 --> 04:27:29,520
Yeah

3025
04:27:32,000 --> 04:27:38,960
If she can make her cheeks clap when she can shake no, I won't stay in but no, I can already tell it's not going to stay in between the cheeks

3026
04:27:49,040 --> 04:27:51,040
I'd know more to me

3027
04:27:51,840 --> 04:27:53,120
Okay

3028
04:27:53,120 --> 04:27:57,360
Check it out. Check it out. It's the disconnection. What are you dressed off as?

3029
04:27:58,480 --> 04:28:00,480
You're like a

3030
04:28:00,960 --> 04:28:02,960
You almost look like a jester on the bottom

3031
04:28:04,320 --> 04:28:06,320
How unique

3032
04:28:06,800 --> 04:28:08,800
curious

3033
04:28:10,000 --> 04:28:15,120
You're so smooth max there, but this is necessary work. Yes. Yes, it's necessary

3034
04:28:15,600 --> 04:28:20,000
Very little of what we do falls within the definition of ordinary

3035
04:28:20,960 --> 04:28:26,160
Ordinary ordinary. Oh, no. Oh, it's rebecca's

3036
04:28:26,800 --> 04:28:30,880
Take away. That's the voice actor for the elf. It's rebecca's take away through through

3037
04:28:35,200 --> 04:28:39,840
After getting into ASMR I'm attracted to cute voices and accents in particular. Mmm

3038
04:28:40,800 --> 04:28:44,560
And me and she be were like shooting the shit a while back ago. Um

3039
04:28:45,920 --> 04:28:48,560
Just talking about like the like how

3040
04:28:49,680 --> 04:28:53,120
Like I told her everything about the process of like like why I picked everyone out

3041
04:28:53,120 --> 04:28:55,520
I mean, I've already said publicly why I picked everyone on that dress

3042
04:28:56,080 --> 04:29:02,240
Um, but she was saying like, oh, I hope we get like accent mix up if we're gonna like do gen two and I'm like, no

3043
04:29:02,320 --> 04:29:04,480
I'm I'm quite on the same pages. Yeah

3044
04:29:05,120 --> 04:29:09,360
Um, we're both like tee hee and and I'd be like, no, I've definitely down for like

3045
04:29:10,240 --> 04:29:12,480
Maybe a Spanish type thing. Um

3046
04:29:13,920 --> 04:29:20,960
Like I think she be showed her enter her a submission video

3047
04:29:23,040 --> 04:29:25,040
Oh shit, I just realized on this character

3048
04:29:26,000 --> 04:29:28,000
Oh

3049
04:29:33,520 --> 04:29:36,000
Wow that cooldown is like taken forever

3050
04:29:39,840 --> 04:29:41,840
Oh, this isn't even one shot

3051
04:29:46,240 --> 04:29:48,240
And when you're

3052
04:29:49,520 --> 04:29:51,520
Okay

3053
04:29:51,760 --> 04:29:53,760
Wait, it goes down so fast when you don't have to

3054
04:29:55,440 --> 04:29:57,200
Wait, what?

3055
04:29:57,200 --> 04:30:02,160
Sorry, I'm trying to figure her out. Maybe playing a new character was a good idea. Um

3056
04:30:04,080 --> 04:30:06,160
Mommy, I meet chili dogs. Can I have one please?

3057
04:30:08,560 --> 04:30:10,560
I can't do energy drink

3058
04:30:12,480 --> 04:30:18,000
No, no, there's it. I mean, there's the caffeine thing. No, but um, no for real if it's not your thing

3059
04:30:18,000 --> 04:30:23,360
You don't have to actually support me like that. Like, uh, I'm gonna make a short about how to support

3060
04:30:23,920 --> 04:30:25,280
your

3061
04:30:25,280 --> 04:30:26,160
like

3062
04:30:26,160 --> 04:30:30,480
Your strummer without actually handing over any money because I think a lot of people

3063
04:30:31,200 --> 04:30:37,600
Definitely like strongly see like if I can't hand over money. I'm not supporting. It's like, no, no, no, no

3064
04:30:38,320 --> 04:30:47,040
You didn't you don't see the the big big picture big picture. Look at big picture. Um, like there's so much that

3065
04:30:47,760 --> 04:30:50,160
even the difference of like, um

3066
04:30:51,120 --> 04:30:57,200
So say I put out an ASMR video and the last like five minutes are just the sleep aid

3067
04:30:57,280 --> 04:30:59,280
So there's no there's no audio in it

3068
04:30:59,600 --> 04:31:03,840
If you sat and clicked off five minutes before the video was ended

3069
04:31:04,640 --> 04:31:10,480
Then the statistics on that video would actually go down a bit if you stayed on for that five minutes

3070
04:31:10,880 --> 04:31:12,000
then

3071
04:31:12,000 --> 04:31:17,040
You know you make the world a difference for the algorithm and it makes it more favorable and like these are things

3072
04:31:17,120 --> 04:31:22,400
We're like, you know, you don't really have to do anything. Like I've uploaded a few shorts. Icy's had a few shorts recently

3073
04:31:22,880 --> 04:31:24,880
um, and

3074
04:31:25,120 --> 04:31:26,320
um

3075
04:31:26,320 --> 04:31:30,800
Just watching the short ones having a giggle and liking it

3076
04:31:31,440 --> 04:31:33,840
Like is completely free like consume that

3077
04:31:34,320 --> 04:31:38,320
I would say consume the content like if you aren't enjoying the streamer

3078
04:31:38,320 --> 04:31:39,760
You're watching anymore

3079
04:31:39,760 --> 04:31:44,160
Then don't feel obligated to like keep watching them like that. Obviously that goes for me

3080
04:31:44,160 --> 04:31:50,720
Like if you're kind of just like normally enjoying any of this like please make sure you're like enjoying what you're doing

3081
04:31:52,160 --> 04:31:55,840
and consuming because obviously you just want to de-stress and

3082
04:31:57,120 --> 04:32:02,000
Like listen to something in the background or take your mind off something for a bit and

3083
04:32:03,360 --> 04:32:05,360
It's just there

3084
04:32:06,160 --> 04:32:09,520
Yeah, sorry. I'm going on like are you trolling on?

3085
04:32:10,480 --> 04:32:13,840
I can beat them through the heads. I'm beating them through the heads

3086
04:32:14,480 --> 04:32:15,840
um

3087
04:32:15,840 --> 04:32:21,200
But yeah, there's like so many ways you can do stuff for free like um, I would say like clipping

3088
04:32:22,080 --> 04:32:24,080
Or like sharing

3089
04:32:24,640 --> 04:32:26,640
content in appropriate places

3090
04:32:26,960 --> 04:32:29,040
Is like major like I think

3091
04:32:30,000 --> 04:32:32,000
I don't know what's happening

3092
04:32:32,960 --> 04:32:37,600
Mama take a scoop of gamer subs in your mouth and I'll have water in mind

3093
04:32:38,080 --> 04:32:41,280
We'll mix the best energy supplement trust

3094
04:32:43,600 --> 04:32:46,320
I mean, I think it would work

3095
04:32:48,480 --> 04:32:50,480
I think it would work

3096
04:32:50,880 --> 04:32:54,560
But I'm not even kidding. I think it would work

3097
04:32:57,280 --> 04:33:00,160
Um, oh wait, I'm the magic girl. Stop

3098
04:33:01,120 --> 04:33:06,400
Sorry, I need to actually cast magic. I'm being silly. I can't see anything because it's blinding

3099
04:33:11,760 --> 04:33:17,040
Yeah, just like YouTube in general but the entertainment industry investors and people will be looking at what the audience wants

3100
04:33:17,920 --> 04:33:19,920
um like um

3101
04:33:20,480 --> 04:33:22,480
That's it

3102
04:33:22,800 --> 04:33:27,200
Right, I can't hurt my teammates with what I'm doing with this fire. So I'm just spraying

3103
04:33:31,120 --> 04:33:33,120
And then what now

3104
04:33:36,720 --> 04:33:41,360
I mean that went all right, I guess for a fire

3105
04:33:42,880 --> 04:33:45,360
I'm a freak. I dry scooped my pee workout

3106
04:33:46,480 --> 04:33:53,040
Yeah, I really started through that but I still said the words clearly enough. I think press r

3107
04:33:53,360 --> 04:33:55,360
Missing the point as usual

3108
04:33:58,080 --> 04:34:00,080
Oh, I can cool off

3109
04:34:05,680 --> 04:34:09,280
I literally opened my hands and go ah the breeze

3110
04:34:12,480 --> 04:34:18,640
The new monkey like souls game, uh, can you stream snipe in souls game in the monkey souls game?

3111
04:34:19,280 --> 04:34:26,000
If so, yes, if not press r to our word of refling. Oh shit. Oh

3112
04:34:29,680 --> 04:34:31,680
I got a bit overzealous. I'm sorry

3113
04:34:32,960 --> 04:34:39,840
Uh, I got a bit excited. I got a bit excited. Okay. I didn't realize I had like whirlwind sprint on from skyrim

3114
04:34:40,560 --> 04:34:47,280
Okay, I may have hit the r key so much that I also hit all the other keys around it

3115
04:34:48,640 --> 04:34:50,640
oopsies

3116
04:34:51,440 --> 04:34:58,080
Oopsies, I'll definitely be going back to my original character. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

3117
04:35:03,040 --> 04:35:05,040
Not the time stamp in pen as well

3118
04:35:08,640 --> 04:35:15,840
If present r to r word of refling was actually an option she'd spam it. I mean I literally just said she was so excited

3119
04:35:19,280 --> 04:35:22,960
No, I singled for it only. Oh, I'm not very good at souls games

3120
04:35:23,040 --> 04:35:28,400
It's why I like elden ring because I get to have you carry me around the game and get to look at all the sites together

3121
04:35:28,480 --> 04:35:30,480
It's like a tourist game if you think about it

3122
04:35:31,120 --> 04:35:33,120
You know a little tourist simulator

3123
04:35:34,720 --> 04:35:37,360
And you're just trying to do the look you try to get rid of the locals

3124
04:35:38,640 --> 04:35:42,080
And no no not the locals the ones that pickpocket you

3125
04:35:44,320 --> 04:35:47,840
Okay, right tug fire time

3126
04:35:49,120 --> 04:35:51,120
Are you squidding me right now?

3127
04:35:52,080 --> 04:36:00,160
Mama press teth f's in the chat box. I did also. Hi mom. I'm back. Hi missland. Did you enjoy yourself?

3128
04:36:03,440 --> 04:36:05,280

3129
04:36:05,280 --> 04:36:07,120
Wait did none of you thought

3130
04:36:07,200 --> 04:36:10,320
Thank you for the super chat stash power

3131
04:36:12,160 --> 04:36:14,160
Princess stroney look I just

3132
04:36:15,120 --> 04:36:20,480
I've beat your game it feels like a lot more

3133
04:36:25,760 --> 04:36:32,800
I don't know what the word is I don't have the vocabulary to like explain why it feels so good to like play games with you

3134
04:36:35,360 --> 04:36:38,400
Uh, I just feels like it's so much more

3135
04:36:39,120 --> 04:36:47,520
Is the word rewarding that's the best word my brain can come up with right now, but it's not like

3136
04:36:51,280 --> 04:36:54,960
You could carry me in outlast trials. Isn't that not a horror game?

3137
04:36:55,760 --> 04:36:57,760
Wait, what are we to do?

3138
04:36:57,760 --> 04:37:01,040
Am I are we going the right way do we just what about the other way?

3139
04:37:03,120 --> 04:37:06,240
The door what door there is no door

3140
04:37:09,360 --> 04:37:11,360
What's path of exile

3141
04:37:13,840 --> 04:37:15,840
The pump house that's where I live

3142
04:37:18,160 --> 04:37:24,480
Yes, I'm a sim strongly is my princess. Oh you call me princess. I think I've ever been called

3143
04:37:26,640 --> 04:37:28,640
I don't really behave like a princess. That's all

3144
04:37:29,520 --> 04:37:32,400
Strongly is my pimp. That's right. You're getting pimped out to the girls

3145
04:37:33,840 --> 04:37:36,800
Get your tentacle out right now the girls need stress relief

3146
04:37:37,680 --> 04:37:39,680
Thank you. Momolo

3147
04:37:39,920 --> 04:37:41,920
Yeah, I suck so bad with the fire

3148
04:37:44,080 --> 04:37:46,080
A pillow princess, okay

3149
04:37:48,400 --> 04:37:53,920
I mean if you don't do all the work, how are you going to see the jiggle of my butt cheeks, you know

3150
04:37:54,880 --> 04:37:56,880
If I'm being over

3151
04:37:58,480 --> 04:38:00,480
That's terrible

3152
04:38:01,040 --> 04:38:03,040
Terrible

3153
04:38:03,280 --> 04:38:05,280
We can't help it

3154
04:38:07,040 --> 04:38:09,040
Bonk

3155
04:38:09,920 --> 04:38:11,920
Bonk

3156
04:38:13,600 --> 04:38:15,600
Bonk

3157
04:38:21,200 --> 04:38:26,000
Bonk strong is my puppy. No. No, we're not doing that today. Yeah

3158
04:38:27,600 --> 04:38:29,600
You can't get me today

3159
04:38:29,920 --> 04:38:32,560
I'm too much of a tryhard on this game if I

3160
04:38:33,440 --> 04:38:37,600
I think I said this yesterday. I've lost my ability to ink again. Last time I inked

3161
04:38:37,680 --> 04:38:43,520
I r-worded myself for that that cheeky drop of serotonin. Um, and I've lost my

3162
04:38:44,480 --> 04:38:46,480
Thank you the booty lord though

3163
04:38:46,640 --> 04:38:48,640
And thank you. Have fun

3164
04:38:49,760 --> 04:38:51,760
Have fun decent. I'm sorry

3165
04:38:52,640 --> 04:38:58,640
Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it. Sorry. I don't know. That was uh, that was an internal

3166
04:38:59,200 --> 04:39:05,040
That was an internal thought that came out though. Thank you. Have fun for the membership. Please don't hate me

3167
04:39:08,400 --> 04:39:14,720
The mods wait, did the mods delete it again mods you're teasing me. You don't have to do that. You're good

3168
04:39:19,360 --> 04:39:21,360
Don't be a silly belly

3169
04:39:21,920 --> 04:39:23,920
Oh

3170
04:39:25,520 --> 04:39:29,520
In boy in boy in boy in boy. Yeah, I'm going back on my mean after this one

3171
04:39:29,600 --> 04:39:34,160
I'm just too used to the hack and slash like it's just so good. I'm I'm nuking this place

3172
04:39:36,000 --> 04:39:38,960
You're all coming with me. You're all coming with me. I'm not going on my own

3173
04:39:40,880 --> 04:39:42,880
You're all coming with me

3174
04:39:44,480 --> 04:39:46,800
I'm just really bad at this character. I think

3175
04:39:48,080 --> 04:39:50,080
Ow

3176
04:39:50,720 --> 04:39:52,720
No, whoa, what is this?

3177
04:39:53,680 --> 04:39:59,120
Idea we take the game as such powder and mix it with strontis for a moan maxing sweat

3178
04:39:59,600 --> 04:40:07,040
It's truly a divine mixture. No, it is not. Do you mean machu chijus or my bio?

3179
04:40:10,160 --> 04:40:13,920
Either way, it's horrific repair the gas pipe. Okay

3180
04:40:14,880 --> 04:40:21,520
We're engineers, trust me. I'm an engineer. What the heck just happened here. Trust me. I'm an engineer

3181
04:40:26,400 --> 04:40:33,760
Never soup gamer subs maxing. I'm following you. I'm just following you. I don't know where we're going

3182
04:40:36,240 --> 04:40:41,440
Thank to the prologue. I didn't realize this game was on a serious discount today

3183
04:40:42,000 --> 04:40:44,000
Oh

3184
04:40:44,320 --> 04:40:46,320
Do not I think that's a bridge

3185
04:40:47,600 --> 04:40:51,360
This is doesn't really feel like we're supposed to go this way. What way?

3186
04:40:52,160 --> 04:40:54,160
Ah, we're to go down

3187
04:40:54,720 --> 04:40:56,720
Down is up and up is down

3188
04:40:57,760 --> 04:40:59,760
Oh my god, pirates of the caravans

3189
04:41:04,480 --> 04:41:06,480
Strontis flavor sweaty slime

3190
04:41:07,920 --> 04:41:09,920
If I could get my own flavor

3191
04:41:10,880 --> 04:41:12,880
Possibly

3192
04:41:13,760 --> 04:41:19,040
Strontis juice gives more energy than any powder conceivable because it's just pure pheromones

3193
04:41:20,080 --> 04:41:22,240
It like hot wires your brain

3194
04:41:22,880 --> 04:41:26,720
So just completely take over and you let breed breed breed breed and then you're awake

3195
04:41:39,920 --> 04:41:43,760
What if we take powder and mummy provides drill for the liquid?

3196
04:41:45,840 --> 04:41:47,840
That's

3197
04:41:51,920 --> 04:41:57,040
Hear me out we mix the gamer subs with refling ink have a taste mama

3198
04:41:58,080 --> 04:42:00,080
What flavor would I mix it with?

3199
04:42:01,520 --> 04:42:03,520
I like when mercy was reviewing it

3200
04:42:04,320 --> 04:42:05,680
I think it was

3201
04:42:05,760 --> 04:42:10,320
The raspberry the blueberry one and she was like it tastes like blue and I'm like I love mercy so much

3202
04:42:11,680 --> 04:42:14,180
Is this where we came from cotton? I Joe?

3203
04:42:20,080 --> 04:42:22,080
Thank you the booty lord

3204
04:42:24,320 --> 04:42:26,320
Am I going mental

3205
04:42:27,280 --> 04:42:29,280
However, we to reach the beacon

3206
04:42:30,720 --> 04:42:32,960
Oh hold on I'm bombing them

3207
04:42:36,560 --> 04:42:40,000
No apparently you are. I have no idea where I'm going. Why?

3208
04:42:41,600 --> 04:42:43,920
Carillion says come this way

3209
04:42:45,760 --> 04:42:47,760
Hmm

3210
04:42:47,840 --> 04:42:49,840
I don't know if I want to try it

3211
04:42:51,120 --> 04:42:52,800
I'm gonna make

3212
04:42:52,800 --> 04:43:00,880
Mm-hmm content leading up to the concert agenda. Wait, is that you want me to say that because I probably will

3213
04:43:03,200 --> 04:43:05,200
Where is it coming from

3214
04:43:05,680 --> 04:43:07,680
Throw it back

3215
04:43:12,560 --> 04:43:14,560
It's so dramatic

3216
04:43:18,640 --> 04:43:25,280
Oh, I'm oh, no, sorry. I'm dumb. I'm very small brained. Okay. I need my other character back. This is awful

3217
04:43:26,960 --> 04:43:30,640
I need my other character back. I can't I can't keep up with this chick

3218
04:43:31,600 --> 04:43:38,720
I'm sure she's good if you're actually good at the game for the problem is I'm just terrible at everything. Oh, I'm literally 7 hp

3219
04:43:40,560 --> 04:43:45,760
Okay, yeah, I'm not playing this character ever again. I'm so sorry refunds. I can't I need

3220
04:43:46,640 --> 04:43:48,640
I need

3221
04:43:49,360 --> 04:43:53,360
Yeah, bris are bris are you dumb as pull up?

3222
04:44:00,880 --> 04:44:02,880
Oh

3223
04:44:03,200 --> 04:44:04,880
Women am I right?

3224
04:44:04,880 --> 04:44:09,440
Can I play the women's character? Is this the way we're supposed to go? I mean it looks like this way

3225
04:44:10,640 --> 04:44:12,640
Okay. Yeah, it's this way

3226
04:44:17,680 --> 04:44:19,680
Bonk

3227
04:44:20,080 --> 04:44:22,080
Mitt wait it goes right through

3228
04:44:22,240 --> 04:44:27,920
However, you on fire and you're like actually. Yeah, I really want to do this fight. Please don't don't be a silly sausage

3229
04:44:28,880 --> 04:44:30,880
Oh, I'll take this one

3230
04:44:33,280 --> 04:44:35,280
Holy sigma

3231
04:44:39,760 --> 04:44:45,280
You want a stun on them, you know the beacon? Okay, we're good. We're good. We made it. We made it

3232
04:44:46,240 --> 04:44:48,240
Now what now what?

3233
04:44:49,440 --> 04:44:52,480
Well, let's just stoke the fire wee bit here we go a little bit extra

3234
04:44:53,520 --> 04:44:55,520
Aim at their feet. That's how it works

3235
04:44:56,480 --> 04:45:00,880
Oh, I don't take any ammo. Is this not where we're supposed to go?

3236
04:45:06,960 --> 04:45:11,440
The variants of characters play different but you've got to play the first version again. Hmm

3237
04:45:14,880 --> 04:45:19,440
Okay bomb the ground feet feet

3238
04:45:20,000 --> 04:45:24,000
Feet feet

3239
04:45:28,160 --> 04:45:32,320
Okay, this is where I'm losing like all my health because I'm sourcing about

3240
04:45:33,520 --> 04:45:35,520
Okay, no fuck this. I'm swinging

3241
04:45:36,320 --> 04:45:40,240
Okay, we all need to stand on the platform any platform standards

3242
04:45:41,200 --> 04:45:43,600
Anyone here stand on the platform. Are we all here?

3243
04:45:44,400 --> 04:45:48,560
Stand on the pressure plate to light the beacon. We're all here

3244
04:45:49,120 --> 04:45:52,400
We fling are you on the who's missing all of us are here

3245
04:45:56,800 --> 04:46:04,080
Oh, there's a loading bar. Okay. Sorry. I understand you come on. Dissolate. Dissolation. It's a bad idea

3246
04:46:06,000 --> 04:46:08,160
Oopsie. Whoopsie. I'm a donna

3247
04:46:09,120 --> 04:46:15,280
We're to stand and fight on the pressure plate whilst it does its pressuring thing

3248
04:46:17,200 --> 04:46:19,440
I am so dead. Okay, that's it. You're all getting you

3249
04:46:25,600 --> 04:46:27,600
Okay, and then press R to cooldown

3250
04:46:30,080 --> 04:46:35,040
And then hold and then

3251
04:46:38,880 --> 04:46:40,880
That was very loud

3252
04:46:42,480 --> 04:46:47,360
Oh rare. Oh, sorry. I just did my ultimate. Uh, whoopsie. Yeah

3253
04:46:48,320 --> 04:46:50,320
This character ain't for me

3254
04:46:50,560 --> 04:46:55,760
I'm more of a swing. I'm more of a ungebungle. Let me swing kind of gamer

3255
04:46:56,480 --> 04:46:58,480
I don't have to think about anything

3256
04:47:08,320 --> 04:47:10,320
Oh

3257
04:47:11,840 --> 04:47:14,880
I'd always take damage when I go up to the second segment

3258
04:47:16,720 --> 04:47:19,280
I've never preferred for wild french though

3259
04:47:20,160 --> 04:47:21,680
strongy

3260
04:47:21,680 --> 04:47:25,200
Well, you don't like when I randomly speak french to ignite hell. Yeah

3261
04:47:26,080 --> 04:47:28,080
Bless it up

3262
04:47:29,280 --> 04:47:31,280
Oh

3263
04:47:34,240 --> 04:47:37,840
The beacons have been lit gondor calls for aid

3264
04:47:39,040 --> 04:47:40,160
That's the same

3265
04:47:40,160 --> 04:47:42,400
Pippin was so brave for claiming up so high

3266
04:47:43,600 --> 04:47:48,880
I'd be shitting my family. What's this? Oh, it's a tunnel. We go in the tunnel

3267
04:47:53,680 --> 04:47:56,080
Copper tarn banks

3268
04:48:00,160 --> 04:48:02,160
Where they all running

3269
04:48:02,800 --> 04:48:11,040
Hmm, you may like the dwarf but not the first specialization like two or three is very ungebungle

3270
04:48:11,920 --> 04:48:13,920
Oh

3271
04:48:27,920 --> 04:48:31,280
We did it we did it we destroyed the pirate ships

3272
04:48:32,480 --> 04:48:34,480
What's that? I wasn't paying attention to the name

3273
04:48:36,800 --> 04:48:39,280
Just doing me to be doing me

3274
04:48:41,840 --> 04:48:43,840
Game broke

04:48:49,280 --> 04:48:52,000
Okay, hold on. I got a few more of the things I wanted to play

3277
04:48:56,800 --> 04:49:01,680
We have one last mission, but don't worry. I'll replay if someone hasn't had a chance to play

3278
04:49:02,880 --> 04:49:05,840

If you're gonna talk like a Frenchman you better kiss like one too

3286
04:49:49,440 --> 04:49:51,440
Why you want a glass we can kiss instead

3287
04:49:53,920 --> 04:49:55,680

Our band will be called

3307
04:51:26,880 --> 04:51:33,120
The school of rock real night is a really cool class for crowbar, but it does require a more tactical understanding

3308
04:51:33,680 --> 04:51:39,520
And have you heard of an Australian kiss it's like a french kiss, but down under

3309

I want to round with you, but I'm not in the game. Yeah, don't worry. We'll play another one. Don't wait. Don't wait

3312
04:52:03,440 --> 04:52:05,440
Okay, we will slight the mission

3313
04:52:08,160 --> 04:52:11,120
And right this is the last one for this story

3314
04:52:12,880 --> 04:52:16,320
And then we'll play to make sure everyone gets a chance to play

3315
04:52:17,360 --> 04:52:20,480
I'll play the first mission. Honestly the first mission is so good an ice one

3316
04:52:27,200 --> 04:52:29,200
Much better I have a bomb

3317
04:52:33,600 --> 04:52:37,040

That's strange. Um, I just enjoy like not having to think I don't know. It just feels good

3363
04:56:35,200 --> 04:56:38,400
Bimbo arch not really but I just

3364
04:56:40,480 --> 04:56:43,600
I'm not having to think I press F when I think I'm in trouble

3365
04:56:44,400 --> 04:56:49,040
I'm slashing the rats. I'm moving next like it just feels good

3366
04:56:49,040 --> 04:56:52,080
And I'm like I've got the replacements with me so the game's not scary

3367
04:56:53,440 --> 04:56:56,880

04:57:15,520 --> 04:57:17,520
I'm brainless because you gave it to

3372
04:57:18,400 --> 04:57:23,280
No one to need to think is a common desire and women wait stop is it?

3373
04:57:24,560 --> 04:57:27,840
These gender norms have hands. Is that real?

3374
04:57:29,920 --> 04:57:35,440
I believe it. I'm sorry. I believe it instantly. I I don't even need to look into the field research that was done

3375
04:57:35,520 --> 04:57:37,520
I believe it with no questions asked

3376
04:57:38,080 --> 04:57:40,080
Where are you going?

3377
04:57:40,480 --> 04:57:42,480
Are you to go down?

3378
04:57:43,200 --> 04:57:45,200
Actually real. Yeah. Oh, well

3379
04:57:46,080 --> 04:57:48,480
I'm not questioning it

3380
04:57:49,760 --> 04:57:53,600
It's not it's not for me to question. Okay. I believe the research

3381
04:57:56,160 --> 04:57:58,480
Might send a study in maros. Oh my god really true

3382
04:57:59,040 --> 04:58:03,360
We should oh my god. I would love to do a study reading stream. Oh my god

3383
04:58:03,360 --> 04:58:06,480
We can look at independent research about really unique topics

3384
04:58:08,080 --> 04:58:11,360
Why haven't I done this earlier? Oh my gosh, I need to pick out

3385
04:58:12,240 --> 04:58:16,080
Articles that we can read and we can discuss it and we can talk. Oh my god. Yes

3386
04:58:20,000 --> 04:58:22,240
This is even better than the educational stream

3387
04:58:24,160 --> 04:58:28,800
Because it's all of it's done and we just need to discuss it and put our points together. Oh my gosh

3388
04:58:30,160 --> 04:58:32,160
Oh, I see a lever

3389
04:58:33,120 --> 04:58:35,120
I

3390
04:58:37,520 --> 04:58:40,960
Can't wait for her to move it to the cooking stream. She's so excited

3391
04:58:41,840 --> 04:58:46,240
She's planning like a bacon sprains and she can just do like

3392
04:58:47,280 --> 04:58:53,920
Azur being moved out just enables her to literally be like the content creator. She wants to be if that makes sense like

3393
04:58:56,080 --> 04:59:00,320
Just so much and I just I'm I'm nervous for the donut song

3394
04:59:00,320 --> 04:59:02,640
But I think she'll do great like I genuinely think she'll do great

3395
04:59:03,360 --> 04:59:05,360
and

3396
04:59:05,760 --> 04:59:12,960
We actually if her room's up I can actually attach the trailer to her donut song room. Did I go the wrong way?

3397
04:59:14,560 --> 04:59:18,720
Oh, you found it. No, it's an old whale's name

3398
04:59:20,080 --> 04:59:23,360
I can't remember Jonah in the world or something

3399
04:59:24,800 --> 04:59:29,840
I know Azur is gonna flourish when she has the space to yes. I 100%

3400
04:59:30,640 --> 04:59:32,640
100 100%

3401
04:59:34,480 --> 04:59:37,920
This kind of stuff is why you're more she's study reading streams. Oh, hey

3402
04:59:41,280 --> 04:59:43,280

I just like things

3404
04:59:48,320 --> 04:59:50,480
Okay, we did not need to come up here. I'm stuck

3405
04:59:51,520 --> 04:59:53,520
Hell free things

3406
04:59:54,240 --> 04:59:56,240
Oh

3407
04:59:59,200 --> 05:00:01,840
What are you doing were you drooling him or something?

3408
05:00:02,960 --> 05:00:08,240
I looked strange from my POV, but I think maybe you're just so we that I couldn't tell what you're fighting them

3409
05:00:09,600 --> 05:00:11,600
Whoa, whoa

3410
05:00:16,240 --> 05:00:21,840
Bacon a cake in the shape of our cake real Andrew Billy and the rats they deserve it

3411
05:00:23,840 --> 05:00:25,840

3413
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:31,760
To eat people

3414
05:00:31,840 --> 05:00:35,040
Shania got a new pc about eight months ago and yet to put blizzard on it

3417
05:00:48,560 --> 05:00:50,960
He was posing. I saw that you're posing

3418
05:00:50,960 --> 05:00:52,960
I

3419
05:00:53,440 --> 05:00:57,120
Like they're just like hanging out waiting for us to show up to hack and slash. I'm like

3420
05:01:01,200 --> 05:01:07,440
Shape up shut up in fight like it's payday. I like that voiceline

3421
05:01:09,520 --> 05:01:11,520
Fight like it's PD

3422
05:01:13,840 --> 05:01:17,680
Oh, he doesn't get lots lots stunned when I block

3423
05:01:18,640 --> 05:01:20,640
Like corn on the cob

3424

Slop on my knob. Oh, sorry, and you give me head right on the bed. I'm not sorry. I kept going

3425
05:01:28,480 --> 05:01:30,480
Am I going the right way?

3426
05:01:34,320 --> 05:01:36,320

3430
05:01:56,560 --> 05:02:02,000
I think I know where we need to go next. I don't know about you, but there's a suspicious looking hole

3431
05:02:04,640 --> 05:02:06,960
No, are you sure?

3432
05:02:09,760 --> 05:02:11,760
Okay, I'm not going in the hole then

3433
05:02:12,240 --> 05:02:15,760
I won't go in the hole now unless the refund gives me express permission

3434
05:02:21,360 --> 05:02:25,200
Gawking and gawping are both I've never heard of gawping before

3435
05:02:28,560 --> 05:02:31,360
I maybe should have bloop sugar

3436
05:02:32,400 --> 05:02:38,240
I don't have never heard of gawping that sounds like how you would describe a wet tucci like oh

3437
05:02:39,120 --> 05:02:45,280
Her tucci was gawping wet. Oh, I'm thinking of softened shit

3438
05:02:46,880 --> 05:02:52,400
You know, I just have really poor um grasp of the english language. Okay. I'm sorry. Please forgive me

3439
05:02:54,880 --> 05:02:57,200
Do forgive I am what is known as dumb

3440
05:02:58,640 --> 05:03:00,880
I am low IQ and I admit it

3441
05:03:01,520 --> 05:03:03,120
But I like it that way

3442
05:03:03,120 --> 05:03:05,120
I like being dumb. I like being like

3443
05:03:05,200 --> 05:03:07,200
This is what I believe in this is what I think

3444
05:03:08,560 --> 05:03:12,480
Because normally when you're dumb you have good intentions or I think you have good

3445
05:03:13,360 --> 05:03:15,360
I don't know

3446
05:03:15,520 --> 05:03:20,560
Really just try your best. Okay. I'm so lost right now. I'm not even kidding. So it's not this way

3447
05:03:23,120 --> 05:03:28,800
No, it definitely does not look like it's this way. I think woke on the mummy. I don't see any secret tunnel or anything

3448
05:03:30,320 --> 05:03:32,800
Oh my god, it's a blacksmith shop

3449
05:03:33,440 --> 05:03:35,440
Hmm

3450
05:03:35,760 --> 05:03:37,760
Mummy has to go to some real

3451
05:03:38,320 --> 05:03:41,760
So do you want to be a bimbo? I think I already am by accident

3452
05:03:43,040 --> 05:03:48,960
I was born this way. Unfortunately. I was born without the ability to correctly think but that's okay

3453
05:03:50,560 --> 05:03:53,200
I just try my best and hope for the best and everyone

3454
05:03:53,920 --> 05:03:58,880
And help where I can I think that's important if you help where you can and that's really all that matters

3455
05:03:59,600 --> 05:04:01,600
I

3456
05:04:05,680 --> 05:04:07,680
You're walking clam

3457
05:04:12,320 --> 05:04:15,360
Cnc moment you can you're doing with that permission?

3458
05:04:16,320 --> 05:04:18,320
Now that is cnc

3459
05:04:19,120 --> 05:04:21,120
Speaking of cnc

3460
05:04:21,360 --> 05:04:23,360
Oh you

3461
05:04:23,440 --> 05:04:27,120
Bomba bomba time bomba time. Oh, please another bomb

3462
05:04:29,280 --> 05:04:31,280
Uh

3463
05:04:31,600 --> 05:04:36,560
Wait, does he not take damage when I stand at that? Oh, he breaks through

3464
05:04:38,880 --> 05:04:40,880
Dinky

3465
05:04:42,880 --> 05:04:49,760
I'm searching the village. I'm searching the village so hard right now in between all the enemies. That's right. I'm searching and searching

3466
05:04:50,320 --> 05:04:52,320
I

3467
05:04:53,920 --> 05:04:58,000
We're going to the lighthouse and it's lighting up the way

3468
05:04:58,320 --> 05:05:01,360
We're self also go find a way to the upper village

3469
05:05:02,320 --> 05:05:05,520
We're in resident evil. We're in resident evil village

3470
05:05:07,200 --> 05:05:12,720
I watched some gameplay of resident evil village. I was like, maybe I judged it too harshly

3471
05:05:12,800 --> 05:05:15,760
Maybe I should give it a chance on stream. Nope

3472
05:05:16,000 --> 05:05:23,920
Nope, absolutely not a game type for me. Don't hand me a gun that doesn't like no not having it

3473
05:05:26,560 --> 05:05:28,560
And then I can heal a refill with this

3474
05:05:31,280 --> 05:05:36,640
Let's have a like she suffers from the oh you can't say that part out loud sit down sit down

3475
05:05:37,280 --> 05:05:41,840
We'll need remember guys her first line. We just go as her second to strong to the minute third is english

3476
05:05:42,800 --> 05:05:47,120
Call out any tomes or boots if you see um, I'll pick them up

3477
05:05:47,840 --> 05:05:49,840
Look at the reason it's working so hard to get

3478
05:05:52,240 --> 05:05:54,240
Bunk bunk bunk

3479
05:05:57,600 --> 05:05:59,680
Oh jeez, I didn't even see you

3480
05:06:00,320 --> 05:06:02,800
Didn't even see you there. Hello, mr. Door

3481
05:06:04,240 --> 05:06:09,840
Hello, there's a draw. Oh my gosh. We can run a pub. Oh my god. We're playing tavern already

3482
05:06:10,400 --> 05:06:15,120
Jeez, I just can't stop streaming. I just I'm already doing two different games in one day

3483
05:06:15,120 --> 05:06:19,760
We're playing tavern master. Look at the look how much we've extended the floor plans

3484
05:06:20,320 --> 05:06:22,800
Just by all the support from the reeflings getting

3485
05:06:24,080 --> 05:06:27,280
There's like tons of concoctions in here if anyone uses them

3486
05:06:28,160 --> 05:06:33,680
I'm walking across the bridge, but there's nothing over here other than a spawn point. So that's okay

3487
05:06:34,080 --> 05:06:37,280
Did you see the giant baby in villa? Yes

3488
05:06:38,080 --> 05:06:40,080
I saw a clip of this

3489
05:06:40,480 --> 05:06:42,240
in real life streamer

3490
05:06:42,240 --> 05:06:49,120
And and she was like scariman and I was like everyone in the comments like uh-huh. Oh this game's not even that scary

3491
05:06:49,920 --> 05:06:51,920
and I'm like

3492
05:06:53,200 --> 05:06:56,080
She reacted exactly how I would have reacted so

3493
05:06:56,960 --> 05:07:00,000
Yeah, I'm not sure about like oh this game isn't even scary shut up

3494
05:07:00,960 --> 05:07:02,960
People are allowed to be terrified of things, you know

3495
05:07:03,680 --> 05:07:10,160
It's almost like it's called like a scary horror franchise like you you activate fill whale oil barrel

3496
05:07:12,080 --> 05:07:15,040
I'm filling the barrel. I don't know how

3497
05:07:16,880 --> 05:07:18,880
I don't know what it's doing

3498
05:07:23,280 --> 05:07:28,960
Oh, oh, it's here. It's here refling at the front at the front here. Yeah. Yeah

3499
05:07:30,720 --> 05:07:32,720
What

3500
05:07:33,200 --> 05:07:36,160
That's not right. How is that not right? Oh, no, it's exposed

3501
05:07:39,680 --> 05:07:43,120
Okay, it's a specific type of barrel. Okay

3502
05:07:44,720 --> 05:07:46,720
Hmm curious

3503
05:07:48,640 --> 05:07:53,440
That game is even scarier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No the baby give me ptsd

3504
05:07:55,920 --> 05:07:57,920
On it later

3505
05:08:00,960 --> 05:08:03,360
Get the listing platform work

3506
05:08:08,320 --> 05:08:15,280
You need an unempty barrel can we just take the gunpowder out then I mean whale oil with a taste of gunpowder

3507
05:08:17,920 --> 05:08:19,920
There's worse things you could I mean

3508
05:08:22,000 --> 05:08:27,520
You know, you've dropped a lollipop on the floor before and it got all mingin and you still eat it anyways

3509
05:08:28,480 --> 05:08:30,800
Instead of washing it off with a five head

3510
05:08:32,800 --> 05:08:34,800
I don't know where these

3511
05:08:34,800 --> 05:08:38,480
Okay, it says already two out of three the lifting platforms are working

3512
05:08:39,040 --> 05:08:45,040
So i'ma just let the reflins cook because I don't know what i'm doing. I'm just hacking and slash. Oh, I don't want to follow for that

3513
05:08:47,600 --> 05:08:50,160
Ow, you weren't even there

3514
05:08:50,160 --> 05:08:57,040
It's true what they say about AI and video games if you look away they get harder

3515
05:08:57,120 --> 05:09:01,920
No, they get easier if you look away because they had to do it that way because it was like too hard for

3516
05:09:02,800 --> 05:09:04,560
and

3517
05:09:04,560 --> 05:09:09,200
Players like they figured I don't know how they did that. I think

3518
05:09:10,480 --> 05:09:12,480
I don't really know the rest

3519
05:09:13,040 --> 05:09:16,720
Here elf. Jeez. You really get into the role play. Yeah, that's so bright

3520
05:09:16,960 --> 05:09:24,080
My gamer eyes cannot handle the sunlight actually my eyes are gonna be blind and want to go outside

3521
05:09:27,040 --> 05:09:30,640
Well first nap then outside, but then

3522
05:09:31,680 --> 05:09:35,440
So normally I like gimli and v go out into the garden for 15 minutes

3523
05:09:36,000 --> 05:09:37,440
and

3524
05:09:37,440 --> 05:09:44,720
I have to be with them because gimli. Yes. I'm talking about you gimli. I'm shaming you on my stream

3525
05:09:45,680 --> 05:09:47,680
She insists on trying

3526
05:09:48,640 --> 05:09:54,480
To escape and I'm like you get fined if your stray cat gets found

3527
05:09:55,200 --> 05:09:58,320
But obviously she's not straight. She's my cat. She's my gimmels

3528
05:09:58,960 --> 05:10:00,960
um

3529
05:10:00,960 --> 05:10:05,040
But she insists on trying to escape and the garden's really freaking big

3530
05:10:05,840 --> 05:10:10,400
And I'm like we'll chase each other like you came together. They were inseparable

3531
05:10:10,880 --> 05:10:13,760
They were described as inseparable, but whenever they play

3532
05:10:14,320 --> 05:10:20,960
She plays too harshly and v go always cries and then that's when I step in and I'm like you two knock off

3533
05:10:21,120 --> 05:10:23,120
Honestly, I feel like an actual mummy

3534
05:10:23,840 --> 05:10:25,040
um

3535
05:10:25,040 --> 05:10:27,040
Maui gimme gimme

3536
05:10:27,440 --> 05:10:29,440
Outside. Yeah, there's garden

3537
05:10:31,440 --> 05:10:34,240
Taking bits on her story will actually go outside after her nap

3538
05:10:35,440 --> 05:10:38,560
I have plenty of time. It's only 9 a.m. It's only 9 a.m

3539
05:10:38,560 --> 05:10:41,600
So if I have a nap that'll take me to

3540
05:10:44,240 --> 05:10:48,960
I will actually we've got another round after this. Um, that'll take me to

3541
05:10:51,440 --> 05:10:53,440
What is this?

3542
05:10:54,240 --> 05:10:57,360
Um, that'll take me to like noon and then I just do

3543
05:10:58,480 --> 05:11:00,480
Walk like I'll make sure gimme and be well

3544
05:11:00,560 --> 05:11:04,880
I'll let them out to the toilet before I go away again and then I'll go for walkies

3545
05:11:05,680 --> 05:11:07,680
And then I'll get my chicken

3546
05:11:07,680 --> 05:11:13,680
And then I'll soak my lentils and then I will chop the veggies. I'll put music on

3547
05:11:14,080 --> 05:11:17,680
Oh, I'll do is I'll put tavern ambience on

3548
05:11:18,240 --> 05:11:24,320
So I'm making food in our tavern for running our tavern business together. I think though

3549
05:11:25,600 --> 05:11:30,960
And I'll chop all the veggies and wash them and oh, sorry. I was an enemy. I wasn't content. It's a tee-hee

3550
05:11:31,520 --> 05:11:33,680
I'm too busy talking about vegetables and

3551
05:11:34,560 --> 05:11:36,160
Putting

3552
05:11:36,160 --> 05:11:40,000
Lentils and water to soften it for my soup. Okay, you're distracting me

3553
05:11:40,320 --> 05:11:43,920
Actually, I need to make sure I've got enough containers for the soup because if I can freeze it

3554
05:11:43,920 --> 05:11:49,200
I'll be like super. I'll be so healthy because it would be really easy to heat it off as well

3555
05:11:50,480 --> 05:11:53,040
Fuck it out. I was a bit too brave for that

3556
05:11:55,280 --> 05:12:00,560
What were you to go this way over the this? Oh, it looks like

3557
05:12:01,280 --> 05:12:03,120
Um

3558
05:12:03,120 --> 05:12:06,960
Yeah, mommy's the same weeks up at 3 30. Yeah, if I have to record something

3559
05:12:06,960 --> 05:12:11,520
I wake up at 2 a.m. Or if I have like a collab out of the like I've got

3560
05:12:12,160 --> 05:12:21,120
On saturday and sunday this week my stream start at 2 o'clock, which means I actually have to get up at 1 a.m

3561
05:12:22,480 --> 05:12:24,480
Which is okay

3562
05:12:24,720 --> 05:12:27,120
Um, I won't be regular

3563
05:12:27,440 --> 05:12:29,440
Um

3564
05:12:29,920 --> 05:12:36,560
Like as I said with a icy thing icy gets to benefit if I wake up early and I don't mind doing that kind of thing for the girls

3565
05:12:36,560 --> 05:12:37,840
at all like

3566
05:12:37,840 --> 05:12:41,200
Literally it's such a small thing and like Azura starts her doughneth on

3567
05:12:41,600 --> 05:12:43,200
and

3568
05:12:43,200 --> 05:12:45,200
at that time so we can

3569
05:12:46,000 --> 05:12:49,920
Collab and then she can focus on the solar stuff because she's got some stuff planned like and

3570
05:12:50,880 --> 05:12:55,920
Uh, I wanted to like enable her to do it right away if that makes sense

3571
05:12:56,480 --> 05:13:01,440
And obviously when we do the golfeit collab Azura like has full

3572
05:13:02,240 --> 05:13:04,160
rights to like we're I

3573
05:13:04,160 --> 05:13:06,160
Kind of was that the way sin did it

3574
05:13:06,720 --> 05:13:11,840
Because since this third was stream sniping me whilst we were playing together

3575
05:13:13,040 --> 05:13:17,600
And when someone like donated or tipped like she was like, oh my god. Thank you for support

3576
05:13:17,600 --> 05:13:21,360
So I did it and I think that would be really funny if we all did that for Azura

3577
05:13:21,680 --> 05:13:27,440
So while we're doing golfeit if someone like denates to zura, we don't be like, oh my god

3578
05:13:27,520 --> 05:13:33,280
Thank you so much for supporting Azura and like and get reaching this goal like oh, we're so happy like that

3579
05:13:33,360 --> 05:13:35,360
I feel like that would be really nice

3580
05:13:36,080 --> 05:13:41,040
Um and goofy like and we'd only play golfeit for like an hour and a bit or whatever

3581
05:13:41,360 --> 05:13:46,400
And then Azura can you know focus on the rest of it, but I think it would be really funny doing it like that

3582
05:13:47,200 --> 05:13:49,200
and

3583
05:13:49,200 --> 05:13:57,120
Oh, they're making human soup. Lovely. Not for me. I'm the green soup. Can I go in it? Oh, you can you can hurt yourself in the soup

3584
05:13:58,320 --> 05:14:00,320
Speaking of soup get off me

3585
05:14:00,400 --> 05:14:02,400
Wait, how did you?

3586
05:14:02,800 --> 05:14:05,280
Okay, you can just go a little to the right

3587
05:14:06,960 --> 05:14:12,640
If you're back to scotland you're gonna stream. I hope you're not getting too much of uh, what's your order for it? I don't

3588
05:14:13,600 --> 05:14:20,400
No, no, I wouldn't change my time slot because I really uh, I think it's good to solidify a time slot

3589
05:14:20,880 --> 05:14:24,720
She says there's two streams right at a different time, but you know once in a blue moon

3590
05:14:25,200 --> 05:14:29,200
All right, uh, bomb a time bomb a time back up back up. We're bombing everything

3591

3594
05:14:55,360 --> 05:15:01,280
Obviously, I'll keep you guys up to date. That's what's happening because if I if and when it happens, um

3595
05:15:02,160 --> 05:15:03,360
Oh, not it

3596
05:15:03,360 --> 05:15:04,720
when

3597
05:15:04,720 --> 05:15:06,720
um

3598
05:15:07,280 --> 05:15:09,280

3599
05:15:09,440 --> 05:15:13,200
Bomb bar. Oh, you got it. No, oh wait

3600
05:15:16,400 --> 05:15:18,400

3601
05:15:20,160 --> 05:15:22,160
Please stop

3602
05:15:22,880 --> 05:15:28,320
Wait, are we not to go through this? Oh, no, we are to go through that. Okay. I thought that I thought that was like, um

3603
05:15:28,400 --> 05:15:30,400
Is this not where we're supposed to put her?

3604
05:15:32,160 --> 05:15:34,160
You stream at the perfect time

3605
05:15:34,320 --> 05:15:36,320
No, I wouldn't change it

3606
05:15:36,800 --> 05:15:42,400
Um, I would adapt to like my sleep schedule. So I'd I guess I'd like sleep all through the day type thing

3607
05:15:43,520 --> 05:15:46,640
Um, because the reason I picked, um

3608
05:15:47,520 --> 05:15:48,640
Um

3609
05:15:48,640 --> 05:15:54,480
For a m is because if I have to go to the doctors or the dentist or anything like that because I was about to

3610
05:15:55,280 --> 05:16:01,040
Um, what round no doom. Okay. If I say this no doom reflings understood

3611
05:16:02,000 --> 05:16:04,000
Pinky promise no doom

3612
05:16:04,880 --> 05:16:06,720
I was

3613
05:16:06,720 --> 05:16:08,720
Getting close to going to the doctors

3614
05:16:09,280 --> 05:16:11,280
Because I'm a heart again

3615
05:16:11,280 --> 05:16:13,280
However, I have

3616
05:16:13,280 --> 05:16:17,040
You know realized I'm not really doing walks and I'm not eating very well

3617
05:16:17,040 --> 05:16:19,920
So that's probably a massive factor and the stress didn't help

3618
05:16:20,480 --> 05:16:25,280
But now that I really am not having a roles

3619
05:16:26,400 --> 05:16:29,280
Workwise like for oh for me alone

3620
05:16:30,320 --> 05:16:32,320
um

3621
05:16:32,400 --> 05:16:33,760
I'm gonna

3622
05:16:33,760 --> 05:16:38,800
Do my soup and my walkies and if I feel better then there's no need to go to the doctor

3623
05:16:39,120 --> 05:16:47,120
No, stop doom and stop don't sense that refling. Um, but I have been feeling better like, um

3624
05:16:48,960 --> 05:16:55,200
The audio manager is about to come into play and I don't have to think about anything after that

05:16:55,280 --> 05:17:00,960

I got my steam name for a stream snake, but if you want to play if you go

3756
05:27:26,400 --> 05:27:30,080
Oh, you haven't played. Oh, no, don't buy the game. Don't buy the game. Just to play. No, no, no

3757
05:27:30,080 --> 05:27:33,360
Keep your money. I do free stream snake games. Don't buy the game. Just the

3758
05:27:34,640 --> 05:27:38,720
You're gonna make me yarn to the nap is coming the nap is coming

3759
05:27:39,520 --> 05:27:41,520
I

3760
05:27:43,360 --> 05:27:48,400
I'm waiting in reserve. Is there anyone having a claim that they've not played

3761
05:27:51,520 --> 05:27:55,920
Does anyone have a claim you already got me on it, bro, we're all going for a nap at the same time

3762
05:27:57,440 --> 05:28:02,560
Respectfully may we think that chief wait, what is that? No, nobody. No. Thank you for this

3763
05:28:04,080 --> 05:28:05,280
Um

3764
05:28:05,280 --> 05:28:07,280
I'm nothing to be honest. This is

3765
05:28:08,000 --> 05:28:10,880
Okay, the post-yap nap is

3766
05:28:12,560 --> 05:28:15,520
Oh, no, I'm still talking about really yawning

3767
05:28:16,640 --> 05:28:18,640
Wake up right hydrate hydrate hydrate

3768
05:28:19,440 --> 05:28:20,480
hydrate

3769
05:28:20,480 --> 05:28:23,520
Oh, you got you got the game. You better have the game. Yahi

3770
05:28:24,880 --> 05:28:31,840
Death must die. What game is that? Sorry. I'm just looking me looking for inspiration. It's just games that you guys are playing death

3771
05:28:33,360 --> 05:28:36,160
Must die have I ever seen gameplay of that?

3772
05:28:38,240 --> 05:28:44,480
Toss a coin in my hat here traveler if you wish to hear the saga of death's demise

3773
05:28:50,560 --> 05:28:54,800
If I hydrate before bed I'll wet myself. Oh, yeah, I just have to give you a little bit

3774
05:28:54,800 --> 05:28:56,800
Okay

3775
05:29:02,640 --> 05:29:04,640
I just went to click away

3776
05:29:06,160 --> 05:29:08,160
It's the middle of a match when I say

3777
05:29:12,080 --> 05:29:14,080
Our word means remainder to drink or war

3778
05:29:16,560 --> 05:29:18,560
Uh

3779
05:29:18,800 --> 05:29:20,800
Okay, you had the game so you can come

3780
05:29:22,400 --> 05:29:24,400
Okay, ah

3781
05:29:25,120 --> 05:29:27,120
All right

3782
05:29:32,560 --> 05:29:37,440
You're drained of blood you need to get blood test they take more than two vials for your blood test

3783
05:29:45,760 --> 05:29:48,160
Death must die is a single player rule like our feature

3784
05:29:51,360 --> 05:29:53,920
All right, all right. It's all right. No

3785
05:29:55,360 --> 05:29:57,360
I

3786
05:30:00,320 --> 05:30:03,920
Want to see if this all don't get in that if no one else has a claim

3787
05:30:06,080 --> 05:30:08,720
Then I give oh, have you played?

3788
05:30:15,040 --> 05:30:17,200
I'm checking my list. I don't see them on my list

3789
05:30:18,080 --> 05:30:20,080
Um

3790
05:30:29,680 --> 05:30:31,680
At least the pain of blood, why are they going to

3791
05:30:33,120 --> 05:30:37,440
Give me the give him his blood back. What the fuck he needs that to get a tentacle

3792
05:30:39,760 --> 05:30:42,560
Oh, I remember actually like oh my god, gammies twee

3793
05:30:44,000 --> 05:30:46,000
Okay

3794
05:30:48,080 --> 05:30:50,080
Mm-hmm

3795
05:30:50,400 --> 05:30:56,160
You just got coconut milk. I did play with you. You don't no no no not your name. You give me your birds out the

3796
05:30:58,000 --> 05:31:02,800
A shinglin, but you did join. Sorry. I never finished my thing

3797
05:31:04,880 --> 05:31:06,880
Is everyone on twitch

3798
05:31:08,960 --> 05:31:10,960
What

3799
05:31:11,520 --> 05:31:14,480
No, I'm not twitch streamer. I'm you two own

3800
05:31:17,760 --> 05:31:19,440
I find that

3801
05:31:19,440 --> 05:31:22,800
Mummy curious. What do you think of the turn beast like final fantasy or dragon quest?

3802
05:31:23,120 --> 05:31:25,600
the only dragon quest experience I've had is

3803
05:31:26,240 --> 05:31:28,800
A dragon quest then it also the starry sky

3804
05:31:29,840 --> 05:31:35,440
I wanted to try other things, but they didn't have like the fourth the four player system and play

3805
05:31:36,560 --> 05:31:38,400
um

3806
05:31:38,400 --> 05:31:40,400
Which I was worried about

3807
05:31:40,880 --> 05:31:42,880
and

3808
05:31:43,440 --> 05:31:46,800
Not sure you're feeling on monster hunter games. Hmm. I

3809
05:31:47,920 --> 05:31:50,960
I think I played monster hunter just as it came out

3810
05:31:52,080 --> 05:31:53,200
but

3811
05:31:53,200 --> 05:31:55,760
Good good gaga. I'm a baby level one

3812
05:31:57,760 --> 05:32:00,800
The part two to the um pregnancy is war

3813
05:32:03,040 --> 05:32:07,120
Um dragon quest eight was the most well received. I was surprised

3814
05:32:07,120 --> 05:32:13,840
You're a good shot at gaining some more information about the skit again. She's going into help and so are you

3815
05:32:14,560 --> 05:32:16,560
Okay, she'll be sneaky

3816
05:32:16,880 --> 05:32:21,760
We're going to be called team redo because we've technically done this map before the temple of sigmar

3817
05:32:22,160 --> 05:32:28,000
Let's allow the help would be fun to carry through monster hunter. Oh, well if you can count now, hold on a minute

3818
05:32:28,480 --> 05:32:32,960
Now hold on a minute if you can stream snake me and carry me through the game. So I don't have to think

3819
05:32:33,920 --> 05:32:38,160
Hold on a minute. I'm ready to play. I'm ready to build up right now. I'm glad to pitch in

3820
05:32:38,800 --> 05:32:41,120
So I need the highest level in the lobby. Oh, no

3821
05:32:43,360 --> 05:32:45,360
Woopie

3822
05:32:45,520 --> 05:32:51,120
Monster hunter is fun. Apparently new game chiller was just rolled for it today. Oh just dropped for it today

3823
05:32:51,600 --> 05:32:53,600
Excuse me. They go watch that right now

3824
05:32:53,920 --> 05:32:54,960
Enjoy

3825
05:32:54,960 --> 05:32:59,280
You only like to watch it if you watch when you're short, which I've already brought it's me. Oh my god

3826
05:32:59,360 --> 05:33:03,600
It was nice try to say to sundry and it's not it's like sundry

3827
05:33:04,960 --> 05:33:09,440
Oh shit sundery sundery. Yeah, okay. That sounds right

3828
05:33:11,120 --> 05:33:14,560
I do I still don't get how it's not called to sundry yandere

3829
05:33:15,200 --> 05:33:18,640
To sundery makes perfect sense in my head

3830
05:33:20,080 --> 05:33:24,080
I saw the shore. It's brah. I was giggling my butt off

3831
05:33:24,160 --> 05:33:28,960
Arista gave me and she's like, is this good? And I'm like Arista. I'm laughing my ass off. Yes. I've already spanked it up

3832
05:33:30,160 --> 05:33:32,160
It's so good

3833
05:33:32,480 --> 05:33:33,520
Um

3834
05:33:33,520 --> 05:33:35,200
Sundary

3835
05:33:35,200 --> 05:33:41,440
I mean, you can't fault my logic for being like yandere to sundary

3836
05:33:42,160 --> 05:33:44,160
You know

3837
05:33:45,840 --> 05:33:49,280
Okay, thank thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that bit

3838
05:33:50,160 --> 05:33:51,280
I

3839
05:33:51,280 --> 05:33:53,280
Just can't do it. Oh, but you

3840
05:33:54,560 --> 05:33:56,560
You just added a you

3841
05:33:59,360 --> 05:34:00,640
I couldn't bet

3842
05:34:00,640 --> 05:34:06,960
I know you're making me second guess. I've already been over it. Mommy say tsunami. Okay. I know tsunami and say summary

3843
05:34:08,240 --> 05:34:10,960
Summary summary some merry

3844
05:34:12,000 --> 05:34:14,000
Summary, I don't know that word

3845
05:34:14,960 --> 05:34:21,920
I know a tsunami is a tsunami because that's what happens when the earthquake happens over the war

3846
05:34:25,760 --> 05:34:30,640
Japanese both have two in susan. Where did you get the two from one to sundry?

3847
05:34:32,880 --> 05:34:38,080
Wait tape tape to sundry. Am I going mental on this little spell way? I think

3848
05:34:38,720 --> 05:34:40,720
I

3849
05:34:43,760 --> 05:34:50,160
Was level four in a game and had higher Europe. Uh, I know you flexing on me with your extra four

3850
05:34:55,360 --> 05:35:02,880
Titt right, what do you mean? Where's the sue coming from? There's literally a you between the s and the u to sundry

3851
05:35:04,000 --> 05:35:06,000
Say bottle of water

3852
05:35:06,000 --> 05:35:08,000
A bottle of water

3853
05:35:08,080 --> 05:35:10,480
I don't say it the way you want to hear it. You're

3854
05:35:11,600 --> 05:35:14,720
Sorry, hold on. I was I was being cheeky and getting up. I think

3855
05:35:15,840 --> 05:35:17,520
I'm being cheeky

3856
05:35:17,520 --> 05:35:19,680
You just said two right now

3857
05:35:21,520 --> 05:35:23,520
The sun sundry

3858
05:35:24,560 --> 05:35:28,240
No, but if you take the t into consideration, that's why I'm saying two

3859
05:35:29,040 --> 05:35:32,640
But obviously now we have learned that the t is not in fact in it

3860
05:35:33,040 --> 05:35:36,800
No, there's like a tiny pop when you sing to

3861
05:35:40,880 --> 05:35:42,880
Out out out

3862
05:35:43,200 --> 05:35:45,200
I'm getting you're getting you

3863
05:35:45,680 --> 05:35:48,320
T is silent. You know what else is silent you after the

3864
05:35:49,360 --> 05:35:51,920
Damn it. Fuck that up. Hold on. All right. Let me try again

3865
05:35:53,360 --> 05:35:56,640
The t is silent. You know what else is silent you after I are worried you

3866
05:35:56,800 --> 05:36:04,400
That was that that was a lot funnier in my head that actually came across really poorly. I'm sorry. I apologize

3867
05:36:04,800 --> 05:36:10,880
That came across very a lot harsher than I meant it to and I apologize if I upset anyone with that one

3868
05:36:13,200 --> 05:36:16,400
That was really harsh. That was a lot funnier in my head

3869
05:36:18,080 --> 05:36:20,080
Damn

3870
05:36:21,280 --> 05:36:23,280
Whoa

3871
05:36:23,920 --> 05:36:25,920
The

3872
05:36:26,240 --> 05:36:30,560
Aggressive I like it. Yeah, that was very aggressive and wildly inappropriate truly

3873
05:36:32,960 --> 05:36:34,080
Um

3874
05:36:34,080 --> 05:36:41,760
Cancel can't cancel. How can you get cancelled if it's but unless the reeflings cancel me that that's

3875
05:36:42,720 --> 05:36:44,720
Yeah

3876
05:36:44,720 --> 05:36:46,720
There's no

3877
05:36:47,280 --> 05:36:51,120
Like if if you want to get canned like I don't even know how you do it for me

3878
05:36:51,200 --> 05:36:55,760
Oh, she she had inappropriate banter with her her own community. They're comfortable with that joke

3879
05:36:58,960 --> 05:37:03,760
Right, okay, like what now what happens? What is one random scottish chick?

3880
05:37:03,840 --> 05:37:07,920
How does that affect you in any way whatsoever? Like please just leave me alone to play rampage. Thanks

3881
05:37:08,800 --> 05:37:11,600
Like please. I just want to play Elden Ring of the Reeflings leave me alone

3882
05:37:12,560 --> 05:37:16,880
What's that? Is that in or out in or out? I don't know

3883
05:37:17,440 --> 05:37:20,640
I don't know what that circle means. I'm just

3884
05:37:22,480 --> 05:37:24,480
It was like a bakery

3885
05:37:26,720 --> 05:37:30,480
Whoa, I'm getting stun locked by the stumps. Oh, you can just walk it dumb ass

3886
05:37:33,280 --> 05:37:40,480
Jumpers Garrett Garrett on twitter. Oh, no, you mean that thing I hardly use and I use it to ink and then

3887
05:37:42,800 --> 05:37:45,040
Oh, you got all my inking location. Oh, no

3888
05:37:46,880 --> 05:37:51,040
That's the threat of a boy who stormed me apply me arward. You know

3889
05:37:52,160 --> 05:37:54,720
Circle equals dwarf invisible area

3890
05:37:56,720 --> 05:37:58,720
You're stealth

3891
05:37:59,840 --> 05:38:01,840
You can stealth

3892
05:38:02,480 --> 05:38:04,480
You little stealthy thing

3893
05:38:05,520 --> 05:38:09,280
Starting to count for for naught. Exactly. Let's be honest. I've said worse

3894
05:38:11,120 --> 05:38:13,120
Right

3895
05:38:13,360 --> 05:38:15,360
Cancel after inappropriate joke

3896
05:38:26,080 --> 05:38:33,120
Maybe I'm ignorant in my way. Maybe I'm an ignoramus the door door stuck. Well, not really you can break the door if you want

3897
05:38:34,080 --> 05:38:39,680
The star neither will be no silence if you are you know, I'll be making lots of noises

3898
05:38:43,840 --> 05:38:45,840
I

3899
05:38:48,720 --> 05:38:52,480
Remember when I first played this I was like, oh, this is the refland room. I take you one by one

3900
05:38:54,640 --> 05:38:58,720
Can you we bunk beds and you'd be you'll be fighting you'll be like

3901
05:38:59,600 --> 05:39:01,600
No, I don't want to be on the top bunk

3902
05:39:02,640 --> 05:39:04,640
No, leave him alone. He's mine

3903
05:39:06,480 --> 05:39:08,480
He belongs to me

3904
05:39:08,560 --> 05:39:10,560
That's a fire that

3905
05:39:12,080 --> 05:39:17,120
Why are the violins getting old dramatic? It's making me nervous

3906
05:39:17,840 --> 05:39:24,640
Early in the morning. Have I gone have I just done a massive circle? No. No. Whoa. I am. Okay. Sorry

3907
05:39:25,520 --> 05:39:27,520
Hold on. Let me chug. Joke

3908
05:39:30,400 --> 05:39:32,880
Stop it. Ah, I hate when that happened

3909
05:39:33,920 --> 05:39:36,240
That was luckiest. Whoa, that's keg's gonna blue

3910
05:39:38,480 --> 05:39:40,480
Hello

3911
05:39:41,680 --> 05:39:44,240
Only I'm a little box then literally

3912
05:39:46,240 --> 05:39:52,880
When I finally come to the reeflings rescue and not just person about no, he belongs to me. He's my responsibility that keg

3913
05:39:54,240 --> 05:39:56,240
I'm about to blow

3914
05:39:57,600 --> 05:39:59,600
Telly who

3915
05:40:03,360 --> 05:40:07,840
Bastion entrant should have baked bastard

3916
05:40:08,960 --> 05:40:12,640
Get it. Oh, sorry. I just hit your keg. I don't know if that's on fire now

3917
05:40:13,840 --> 05:40:15,680
It's um, oh

3918
05:40:15,680 --> 05:40:17,920
It wasn't me. I was hit. It was you. It was you

3919
05:40:19,600 --> 05:40:23,760
Wait, I don't understand. Did we ever go against one of these before?

3920
05:40:24,400 --> 05:40:27,040
Why are these like unlocked now or something?

3921
05:40:27,760 --> 05:40:30,240
I don't ever remember going against a bio troll

3922
05:40:31,200 --> 05:40:33,200
like genuinely

3923
05:40:33,520 --> 05:40:35,520
Oh

3924
05:40:38,080 --> 05:40:40,080
Cause like what?

3925
05:40:42,240 --> 05:40:44,240
I'm gonna be not

3926
05:40:44,400 --> 05:40:47,600
He's vomiting on me. Oh, it's a dodge

3927
05:40:49,520 --> 05:40:56,320
You did it three rounds ago. No, I mean the first time I played I don't recall ever going against a bio troll. Am I just

3928
05:40:58,320 --> 05:41:01,280
Going mental I'm just completely forgetting. I think I might be

3929
05:41:03,200 --> 05:41:08,960
As a random chance. I can't myself what it is because I just don't remember going against him the first time we played together

3930
05:41:10,640 --> 05:41:13,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa steady on

3931
05:41:14,880 --> 05:41:16,880
Yeah, go here with that get out of here

3932
05:41:20,080 --> 05:41:25,360
I'm absolutely bonked to smithereens things like bio trolls actually come more common

3933
05:41:25,520 --> 05:41:27,520
And oh

3934
05:41:30,800 --> 05:41:33,120
Beat him up beat him up beat him up beat him up reasons

3935
05:41:41,040 --> 05:41:48,160
It's a gas round make my way over making my way over to the gas round and really annoying me

3936
05:41:48,880 --> 05:41:50,880
Do

3937
05:41:54,160 --> 05:41:56,160
Make him always

3938
05:41:56,480 --> 05:41:58,480
Something's happening here. What's going on here?

3939
05:42:03,360 --> 05:42:06,880
I'm seeing red. I saw a lot of red there. Mm-hmm suspicious

3940
05:42:09,520 --> 05:42:11,520
Are you squiddin me right now?

3941
05:42:12,480 --> 05:42:19,520
It's random mostly, but they do have certain bosses for each area like the super dark caves from last time we played

3942
05:42:19,920 --> 05:42:21,920
Oh

3943
05:42:22,800 --> 05:42:24,800
That's random math

3944
05:42:26,160 --> 05:42:28,160
It's random math

3945
05:42:28,720 --> 05:42:30,720
Okay, let me explain. Thank you

3946
05:42:34,560 --> 05:42:36,560
I have a bookie

3947
05:42:36,800 --> 05:42:38,800
I'm so smart I read

3948
05:42:39,040 --> 05:42:42,960
I never told you the other books I got and I already forgot what I got

3949
05:42:43,440 --> 05:42:46,960
But I I looked to tell you what other books I got but I already forgot

3950
05:42:50,160 --> 05:42:53,680
But I did get the snowden one. I know I got the snowden one

3951
05:42:55,280 --> 05:42:57,280
I was looking up, um

3952
05:42:58,480 --> 05:43:04,000
Like what are the most like common like kind of either propaganda related

3953
05:43:04,560 --> 05:43:11,760
And before you're late, what do you mean propaganda? I don't mean propaganda is into propaganda eat myself into believing

3954
05:43:11,840 --> 05:43:16,000
I mean like ones that discuss it like enolize the all that kind of thing

3955
05:43:16,800 --> 05:43:20,240
um, and that snowden one was like a good one and

3956
05:43:21,120 --> 05:43:27,120
I'm may look into whistleblower like related ones. I wouldn't mind that

3957
05:43:28,320 --> 05:43:30,320
Um

3958
05:43:31,280 --> 05:43:35,440
I'm gonna do another George Orwell type type of

3959
05:43:37,200 --> 05:43:39,040
One

3960
05:43:39,040 --> 05:43:40,800
The e-book

3961
05:43:40,800 --> 05:43:48,720
Tell us Johnny. Did you get corn? No, I don't read those. I don't have an interest in like kind of either educational or like

3962
05:43:49,120 --> 05:43:51,120
uh, perception ones or

3963
05:43:51,680 --> 05:43:56,640
That kind of thing. I don't think I I wouldn't recommend like what I read just because I have a like

3964
05:43:57,520 --> 05:44:02,800
Rubbish taste like I'm aware that I either have a very generic level taste

3965
05:44:04,080 --> 05:44:10,160
Like there's no way I'm gonna read a book that hasn't been reviewed and like highly critically acclaimed type thing

3966
05:44:10,160 --> 05:44:16,720
Like I don't want to waste my it's not waste of time. Although is it can it be a waste of time? No, it is just chilling

3967
05:44:17,760 --> 05:44:19,760
and

3968
05:44:21,280 --> 05:44:23,280
Oh

3969
05:44:23,520 --> 05:44:25,040
Oh

3970
05:44:25,040 --> 05:44:28,240
Dear, okay, that's much better. That's much better. That's what I want to see

3971
05:44:29,360 --> 05:44:31,360

3977
05:45:06,800 --> 05:45:11,600
Although I'm wondering if because you guys are like all lower level because you don't have loadouts and stuff

3978
05:45:12,640 --> 05:45:14,640
That I'm making it hard

3979
05:45:18,560 --> 05:45:20,560
I

3980
05:45:20,800 --> 05:45:22,800
So I need to show you

3981
05:45:24,640 --> 05:45:26,640
Oh, you are in this

3982
05:45:31,040 --> 05:45:37,280
You usually prefer images or videos, I think you should animate. I think you should animate

3983
05:45:39,040 --> 05:45:41,040
Oh, I'm so sorry

3984
05:45:42,160 --> 05:45:44,160
Like content

3985
05:45:44,800 --> 05:45:46,800
You mean popcorn I like to consume

3986
05:45:48,640 --> 05:45:50,640
What are you talking about here?

3987
05:45:51,520 --> 05:45:53,520
Do you love this journalism?

3988
05:45:54,400 --> 05:45:56,400
At least me ramble forever

3989
05:45:57,360 --> 05:45:59,360
I always have something

3990
05:46:01,840 --> 05:46:07,440
So mummy gets off with education. Hey, no, no, I don't get all like that

3991
05:46:09,440 --> 05:46:14,320
Can you go over there? It looks like you can but I'm not risking it. I'm not actually going over there

3992
05:46:14,320 --> 05:46:19,440
I meant said my brain farted in the other night

3993
05:46:21,680 --> 05:46:23,680
Oh

3994
05:46:29,920 --> 05:46:34,480
I think I think audio a lot

3995
05:46:36,240 --> 05:46:37,920
Like

3996
05:46:37,920 --> 05:46:42,640
If a video has like low quality, but the audio is like crystal clear

3997
05:46:43,280 --> 05:46:45,280
I prefer that

3998
05:46:45,760 --> 05:46:46,960
over like

3999
05:46:46,960 --> 05:46:48,960
porky up close

4000
05:46:49,440 --> 05:46:51,440
type thing that's not

4001
05:46:52,080 --> 05:46:55,440
Nasty sir for me. Uh, oh, I'm big audio big audio

4002
05:46:57,520 --> 05:47:04,640
But if I if something is extremely there's a totem down in this path, but I don't have book

4003
05:47:06,880 --> 05:47:11,280
Uh, do we need to tell them? I don't know. We're just mucking about actually we don't need to try hard

4004
05:47:12,640 --> 05:47:14,640
Oh, there's art down there

4005
05:47:16,240 --> 05:47:18,240
Wait, what do you think?

4006
05:47:19,600 --> 05:47:23,520
Oh, the the art was here. Sorry, both are great, but I'll do one

4007
05:47:27,040 --> 05:47:34,400
Get out of here. I picked up here tons of healing. Yeah, you'll never guess what comes up next

4008
05:47:38,400 --> 05:47:40,240
Oh

4009
05:47:40,320 --> 05:47:46,800
No, the game telling me off because I healed like 8 hp so rude. I can't block him

4010
05:47:49,120 --> 05:47:51,120
Oh, he's too strong

4011
05:47:51,280 --> 05:47:55,280
Right, I'll take a med kit and then I can heal a refill and there's people down in hell

4012
05:47:56,320 --> 05:48:00,720
I don't have that book anymore. Does anyone take my book? Did I lose my book? No

4013
05:48:01,520 --> 05:48:03,520
No, I think a roofing could kill

4014
05:48:04,960 --> 05:48:07,840
Totems are for xp and getting better chest at them

4015
05:48:08,800 --> 05:48:11,920
I don't know if I'll be playing that much once we finish here

4016
05:48:17,120 --> 05:48:23,040
Literally, we'll go next mission for the reef ones that didn't get a chance and then I think that's uh

4017
05:48:23,040 --> 05:48:27,680
I think there's only three reef ones that haven't played and then I'm gonna go for a nap

4018
05:48:27,680 --> 05:48:30,320
But first I need to like gimme out to the heaven ship

4019
05:48:30,320 --> 05:48:32,320
Yeah

4020
05:48:32,560 --> 05:48:34,560
Because they go in the garden

4021
05:48:34,560 --> 05:48:38,880
I don't have to clean up any cat litter boxes because we're just more and I love them

4022
05:48:39,520 --> 05:48:41,520
And they're the most precious little bees

4023
05:48:46,000 --> 05:48:50,720
No need for video of mummies and mayors. Johnny, do you want us to send some more dozen recommend it?

4024
05:48:51,600 --> 05:48:53,600

4026
05:48:55,440 --> 05:48:57,440

Uh on blue stream

4028
05:49:00,720 --> 05:49:02,720

05:49:06,960 --> 05:49:08,480
Wow, wow, wow, wow

4030
05:49:08,480 --> 05:49:13,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I ain't that fast. I ain't that quick. Sorry reef blend. I couldn't reach

4031
05:49:14,400 --> 05:49:16,400
My little arms they can't reach

4032
05:49:18,080 --> 05:49:20,080
Yeah, two of us can play that game

4033
05:49:25,120 --> 05:49:28,240
I use my all I given everyone temporary hk that's

4034
05:49:30,320 --> 05:49:35,680
I'm now desecrating corpses because uh, I'm hacking and slashing on things that are very very dead

4035
05:49:43,440 --> 05:49:45,440
I've got nobody

4036
05:49:46,880 --> 05:49:50,880
Oh that headshot I'm gonna pretend it's a headshot not because I'm on easy mode

4037
05:49:53,680 --> 05:49:57,600
I'm just so good. I'm just so good get right get off the stairs

4038
05:49:57,840 --> 05:49:59,840
No running in the hallways

4039
05:50:01,760 --> 05:50:05,200
Oh, I wanted to give Billy a shot. Uh, I asked my dad

4040
05:50:06,160 --> 05:50:11,840
If I could get the game, but he never bought me it because he didn't like it like he thought it was gonna make me a

4041
05:50:12,400 --> 05:50:14,400
bad

4042
05:50:14,400 --> 05:50:16,400
Child and he never got me

4043
05:50:17,360 --> 05:50:22,080
But apparently Billy's like really well rated. I don't know if it would frustrate me though

4044
05:50:22,080 --> 05:50:24,960
That's the only thing I don't feel like old mechanics or something, but

4045
05:50:25,840 --> 05:50:27,840
If you guys recommend it, I'll play Billy

4046
05:50:28,560 --> 05:50:30,560
Billy's the load of fun

4047
05:50:30,960 --> 05:50:33,200
That headshot was actually pre-recorded real and true

4048
05:50:34,480 --> 05:50:36,480
Jeez, I'm getting only broken

4049
05:50:37,440 --> 05:50:39,440
by

4050
05:50:40,720 --> 05:50:42,720
I can't even see the enemy

4051
05:50:43,600 --> 05:50:48,560
And it's like gta button skill. Oh, we've not even played gta 4

4052
05:50:55,920 --> 05:51:00,960
Oh, I've even thought about the gta series. Maybe we should

4053
05:51:04,960 --> 05:51:07,920
Gta what son Andrea

4054
05:51:09,440 --> 05:51:15,120
4 and 5 campaign would be pretty good. I think in

4055
05:51:17,840 --> 05:51:19,840
Die will ya

4056
05:51:20,800 --> 05:51:22,800
You

4057
05:51:23,360 --> 05:51:25,360
Yeah, that's so creepy the way they're crawling off

4058
05:51:30,240 --> 05:51:35,920
I just need to check behind me in case there's a they're paling up behind me and I don't realize but I think I'm okay

4059
05:51:39,120 --> 05:51:41,120
Ah, she he was gonna eat

4060
05:51:42,240 --> 05:51:44,240
You we did it

4061
05:51:44,960 --> 05:51:46,160
I think

4062
05:51:46,160 --> 05:51:47,360
No

4063
05:51:47,440 --> 05:51:50,240
Yep, ready we did it refland

4064
05:51:54,320 --> 05:51:56,480
My pintas it fell off

4065
05:51:58,480 --> 05:52:00,480
Billy is actually about fighting against them

4066
05:52:01,280 --> 05:52:03,280
is it

4067
05:52:03,760 --> 05:52:09,360
She paid so many actors who's pre-recorded rounds is actually just the same three reflings going in and out

4068
05:52:09,760 --> 05:52:14,320
They're just changing their steam profile pictures and names and so you've got a pillar up the ar

4069
05:52:15,200 --> 05:52:18,400
I see are you guys seeing the artwork grace like one of those

4070
05:52:20,160 --> 05:52:22,800
Yeah, look at that. No the nap is coming

4071
05:52:23,280 --> 05:52:29,200
I think there's one more batch of refunds that want to play and then I will throw myself away for a nap

4072
05:52:31,600 --> 05:52:36,480
Paid refilling us allocate. I'm not I'm not beating them. I got a chest

4073
05:52:39,680 --> 05:52:41,680
The spoils of war

4074
05:52:44,720 --> 05:52:46,720
Oh

4075
05:52:53,600 --> 05:52:55,600
How who

4076
05:52:56,560 --> 05:52:58,560
Right melee kills I got the most

4077
05:52:59,520 --> 05:53:05,600
And I got the most headshots again without trying. I think I must have a headshot buff on or something

4078
05:53:06,240 --> 05:53:10,720
The artwork. Yeah, the artwork. There's an artwork of like

4079
05:53:11,680 --> 05:53:13,440
I think it's of a

4080
05:53:13,440 --> 05:53:16,160
A chick sitting on the pier like it's anime

4081
05:53:16,720 --> 05:53:24,400
And style and she's sitting on the pier and it's like the pier stopper things where you tie the ships to they're like all along

4082
05:53:25,120 --> 05:53:31,520
And symmetrically like a part if that makes sense, but then she's sitting right where one of them should be

4083
05:53:32,560 --> 05:53:34,560
um

4084
05:53:35,520 --> 05:53:36,800
Yeah

4085
05:53:36,800 --> 05:53:40,960
You know what I mean? Thanks for carrying me moment. You're welcome. You're welcome

4086
05:53:42,560 --> 05:53:45,360
Okay, who least claimed to not have played yet

4087
05:53:47,520 --> 05:53:52,400
Is that an implicated? Yeah, it was like an implication because it was like right in the thing

4088
05:53:53,120 --> 05:53:55,520
Not bad for the first game. Yeah, good

4089
05:53:56,720 --> 05:53:59,760
I think I might have seen that image. I mean I might get myself

4090
05:54:00,000 --> 05:54:02,000
I

4091
05:54:03,520 --> 05:54:06,800
Okay, so any we felons that have not had a chance

4092
05:54:08,640 --> 05:54:10,640
To play this round

4093
05:54:11,360 --> 05:54:12,480
and

4094
05:54:12,480 --> 05:54:14,480
One are

4095
05:54:15,840 --> 05:54:18,800
Deus, you've not played you're not on my list

4096
05:54:20,960 --> 05:54:22,960
dear

4097
05:54:26,480 --> 05:54:28,480
And then

4098
05:54:29,040 --> 05:54:33,360
If you do really make sure it's really scholarship edition that is remastered. It's a lot better

4099
05:54:34,320 --> 05:54:36,320
I want to replicate it with a reefland

4100
05:54:36,800 --> 05:54:41,360
I want to make a you guys want to see a magic trick and watch this tentacle disappear

4101
05:54:43,200 --> 05:54:45,200
I'm rooting for you

4102
05:54:46,080 --> 05:54:49,120
What a a golfer that would be

4103
05:54:49,600 --> 05:54:51,600
Um

4104
05:54:53,440 --> 05:55:01,440
Check it warriors Orochi for 170 playable cat. How do you pick there's so much off like fate

4105
05:55:02,240 --> 05:55:04,240
fate

4106
05:55:04,320 --> 05:55:06,320
uh, okay, um

4107
05:55:06,720 --> 05:55:10,800
I think that is no if no one else is laying claim that they've not had a shot yet

4108
05:55:10,880 --> 05:55:12,880
Then I think repeats are allowed

4109
05:55:13,600 --> 05:55:15,840
I don't see anyone in chat laying claim

4110
05:55:16,800 --> 05:55:19,280
Oh, we're more than we're more than so hard. Hold on. I

4111
05:55:23,200 --> 05:55:25,200
I don't miss the march

4112
05:55:26,480 --> 05:55:28,480
Talk to the hand because the face ain't listening

4113
05:55:29,440 --> 05:55:31,440
Talk to the hand because the face ain't listening

4114
05:55:33,680 --> 05:55:41,120
Little little commit for let's quickly play a random mission with a bonus reward. This is the quickest way to find a party

4115
05:55:41,920 --> 05:55:44,800
I already got me a party a reefland

4116
05:55:45,840 --> 05:55:48,320
Uh, what was another good mission?

4117
05:55:50,240 --> 05:55:52,240
Against the grain is funny

4118
05:55:53,760 --> 05:55:55,760
Why not

4119
05:55:57,600 --> 05:56:03,840
Tentacle reappear just be reappear just be okay. I will delete my little streamsnake name

4120
05:56:05,440 --> 05:56:07,440
And unpin it

4121
05:56:08,800 --> 05:56:13,280
And then we will redirect into sheeperton as she's so up

4122
05:56:14,240 --> 05:56:16,240
I'm not sure if she's both or not

4123
05:56:17,440 --> 05:56:19,440
Um

4124
05:56:26,240 --> 05:56:30,960
You Scottish magician makes it disappear a little too fast. Are we ready?

4125
05:56:32,400 --> 05:56:36,160
Ready. Are we steady? Are we coming down the stairs?

4126
05:56:36,640 --> 05:56:38,640
Are we ready? Are we steady?

4127
05:56:39,280 --> 05:56:41,280
Because we are almost there

4128
05:56:41,840 --> 05:56:43,840
Are you squiddin me right now?

4129
05:56:44,800 --> 05:56:50,960
Today is a sad day. My tentacle died. May I bury it inside your plan mama?

4130
05:56:52,320 --> 05:56:54,240
That's creative

4131
05:56:54,240 --> 05:56:58,720
I'll give you that. You'll make a host at a little funeral. Where are you going to put the bouquet?

4132
05:56:59,040 --> 05:57:01,040
The flowers let you put

4133
05:57:04,720 --> 05:57:06,720
Thank you for the super chat the baby lord

4134
05:57:07,680 --> 05:57:14,480
Where do you put the before oh my god, no as with the superhero intro all four of us together. Oh my god

4135
05:57:15,520 --> 05:57:20,240
Oh my god, the real superhero intro right we must reclaim the reefling farm

4136
05:57:28,960 --> 05:57:34,880
Good luck on the mage by the way, she's stuck. Well, she doesn't suck. I suck. Okay. I'm just not good at handling

4137
05:57:35,280 --> 05:57:37,280
Oh my god, it's wild iris

4138
05:57:41,040 --> 05:57:46,800
I love when video games put in real flowers from actual really as opposed to coming up the flowers

4139
05:57:53,920 --> 05:57:59,040
Did you get sand stuck in your climb how else did you grow this big pretty peril?

4140
05:57:59,680 --> 05:58:05,200
I don't even ever heard of someone complimenting the prettiness of uh

4141
05:58:06,640 --> 05:58:08,640
the Doris and

4142
05:58:10,960 --> 05:58:12,960
That's rather funny to think about however

4143
05:58:14,800 --> 05:58:18,400
Hold on i'm swinging we're reclaiming the farmland

4144
05:58:19,760 --> 05:58:23,120
How dare you this is for reeflings only you're not reefling

4145
05:58:25,760 --> 05:58:27,760
Oh my goodness, I just realized the farm

4146
05:58:29,360 --> 05:58:31,920
Oh, no the farm is just feudalism

4147
05:58:34,320 --> 05:58:39,280
If you look hard enough history, he's gonna repeat itself. Oh, no the farm's just feudalism

4148
05:58:42,400 --> 05:58:48,560
Oh, no wait, no I can't be because I actually give you what you want and it's not like a weird thing about it

4149
05:58:48,800 --> 05:58:52,480
Okay, no, it's not that bad. It's not that bad. Okay. It's really not that bad

4150
05:58:53,920 --> 05:58:55,920
What in the cod zombies is that?

4151
05:58:59,600 --> 05:59:01,600
Oh

4152
05:59:07,200 --> 05:59:13,120
Yeah, I don't remember all these kind of enemies when we played the first time because i'm the host maybe

4153
05:59:15,120 --> 05:59:18,720
I'm shooting reefling. I'm so sorry. I'm shooting so hard right now

4154
05:59:19,840 --> 05:59:22,720
And you get yeeted. Oh, it's my turn now. It's my turn now

4155
05:59:24,160 --> 05:59:28,720
That's not the kind of tentacle i'm interested in get out of here spawn of chaos

4156
05:59:29,280 --> 05:59:31,840
Oh, i'm out of ammo. Hold on. It's hacking slash time

4157
05:59:33,040 --> 05:59:38,080
Now i'm beating him up. Now i'm beating him up get up drop him drop their reefling

4158
05:59:42,480 --> 05:59:47,520
I thought the farm is gonna be communism and also inconomy. Oh, inconomy. Oh, yes

4159
05:59:48,320 --> 05:59:55,200
Inconomy is what i'm gonna call it. Oh my god cheese and potatoes. Are they blighted? No, they just

4160
05:59:55,600 --> 05:59:58,080
They look like sweet potatoes, but not colored like this week

4161
05:59:59,200 --> 06:00:01,200
All right, we'll leave that intact

4162
06:00:03,520 --> 06:00:06,000
Call me a baby star for milk because that pro's gonna get

4163
06:00:10,000 --> 06:00:12,000
Okay, that's like

4164
06:00:13,040 --> 06:00:15,360
Flowers look our farms regrowing

4165
06:00:16,320 --> 06:00:18,480
We're gonna have all the pollinators visit

4166
06:00:19,760 --> 06:00:22,880
Get them make them regret being born

4167
06:00:25,520 --> 06:00:27,520
Oh, I've been

4168
06:00:32,320 --> 06:00:34,320
Remunda cheese

06:00:37,760 --> 06:00:40,240
Wow, you go. Okay you go

4170
06:00:43,040 --> 06:00:46,640
Inconomy more like ink on me. Okay, that was good again. Well

06:00:49,040 --> 06:00:52,240

4172
06:00:52,240 --> 06:00:54,240
Okay

4173
06:00:54,560 --> 06:00:58,880
I am pleased you have appeased me with your words funny man

4174
06:01:02,960 --> 06:01:07,280
See they say oh, oh, oh only reeflings are good for

4175
06:01:08,400 --> 06:01:10,400
Inking and all that. No

4176
06:01:11,120 --> 06:01:13,120
Reeflings also have good work

4177
06:01:13,840 --> 06:01:15,840
Oh

4178
06:01:17,120 --> 06:01:19,120
Nice running out with you. I'm good

4179
06:01:21,120 --> 06:01:25,680
How's the vermin Titan is going good? We're finishing up now because

4180
06:01:26,720 --> 06:01:31,680
We finished the un like unlocked campaign and dlc if you will

4181
06:01:32,400 --> 06:01:34,400
um, oh my god, um

4182
06:01:35,600 --> 06:01:39,920
We're just replaying so everyone gets a chance that I wanted to play and then I'm going for

4183
06:01:40,400 --> 06:01:45,280
And up and then I'm making chicken soup because I want to eat healthy

4184
06:01:45,280 --> 06:01:50,080
And I'm making batches of soup for myself so I can freeze it and then I can just heat it up

4185
06:01:51,440 --> 06:01:57,040
And then I need to get a baguette as well like crusty bread to have my

4186
06:01:57,520 --> 06:02:01,920
Because you can't have soup without crusty bread. So I'm going to get a baguette too. Actually completely

4187
06:02:04,160 --> 06:02:06,160
I am out of ammo. I can't help

4188
06:02:09,920 --> 06:02:11,920
No

4189
06:02:21,760 --> 06:02:23,760
That's a lot of enemies

4190
06:02:23,760 --> 06:02:25,440
Hold on

4191
06:02:25,440 --> 06:02:29,680
I'm unfortunately out of munition for any long range attack, which is a wee bit annoying, but

4192
06:02:31,280 --> 06:02:33,920
Go away. No, he pushed me off too

4193
06:02:33,920 --> 06:02:35,920
I

4194
06:02:39,360 --> 06:02:44,160
Was he I could hear him talking but that was too much he happened in the middle of a fight where you lost

4195
06:02:45,280 --> 06:02:48,560
Wrap it up or you're losing the fight. I don't know why I would pretend otherwise

4196
06:02:57,600 --> 06:03:00,800
Okay, okay, we can do this we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it

4197
06:03:01,680 --> 06:03:02,800
I

4198
06:03:02,800 --> 06:03:04,800
Are you a cock a leafy?

4199
06:03:05,600 --> 06:03:08,480
Wait, what's the cock a leafy? Why did I know that word?

4200
06:03:10,640 --> 06:03:12,640
What's the cock a leafy?

4201
06:03:13,440 --> 06:03:15,440
I feel like games medieval weapons

4202
06:03:16,480 --> 06:03:18,480
chivalry too

4203
06:03:22,320 --> 06:03:28,160
I love hecking vermin tight to such a good game to blow off steam also for really in handmaiden got them grippers out

4204
06:03:28,800 --> 06:03:32,880
Oh, yeah, we have appreciated the grippers wherever other shoes

4205
06:03:34,160 --> 06:03:40,000
We got the grippers up. Oh, it's a Scottish soup. Oh, right. Yeah, I knew I was gonna say I was like, why the fuck

4206
06:03:42,000 --> 06:03:50,720
It's okay. I'm not making cock a leafy. I'm making chicken potato and carrot and celery and chicken billy on

4207
06:03:51,600 --> 06:03:53,600
and

4208
06:03:54,720 --> 06:03:56,720
Uh, I'm using

4209
06:03:58,240 --> 06:04:00,740
Maybe I'll put peas in it. I do like peas

4210
06:04:02,960 --> 06:04:08,640
Uh, maybe there'll be another maybe cat. Do you put cabbage in soup? I don't think

4211
06:04:09,360 --> 06:04:11,360
That's right. I mean

4212
06:04:14,800 --> 06:04:22,400
I want to I want to min max on vegetables unironically to make myself super do for healthy super healthy

4213
06:04:23,360 --> 06:04:30,160
Oh, it's a piggy. Hi, mr. Piggy. Hi y'all. Are you just chilling? Did they leave the livestock alone?

4214
06:04:31,520 --> 06:04:33,520
Oh, that was some teamwork there. We almost got

4215
06:04:35,680 --> 06:04:38,480
Reef fling I saw rippling I saw that

4216
06:04:39,520 --> 06:04:43,360
Reef fling I saw that just because you have your toes out doesn't mean going to forgive you for spanking the pig

4217
06:04:44,800 --> 06:04:47,840
You can pick cabin soup. Okay. I may get cabbage as well because I like cabbage

4218
06:04:48,000 --> 06:04:50,000
Yeah

4219
06:04:50,320 --> 06:04:52,320
Hi piggy

4220
06:04:52,400 --> 06:04:57,440
Oh, no, there's not much to munch on in here. You need to go out into the field to get into the pasture

4221
06:04:57,520 --> 06:05:00,800
So you can get all the nice things with all the other piggies too

4222
06:05:03,120 --> 06:05:05,600
Damn, they did not like that farmer

4223
06:05:08,080 --> 06:05:10,080
Nothing hiding in here

4224
06:05:10,960 --> 06:05:14,720
Get for some bacon for my sip. Yeah, I said chicken

4225
06:05:14,960 --> 06:05:16,080
Okay

4226
06:05:16,080 --> 06:05:22,720
Because chicken is the best meat. I don't care what anyone says. It's not steak. It's not

4227
06:05:23,840 --> 06:05:25,840
Um wagyu

4228
06:05:27,200 --> 06:05:29,200
It's not

4229
06:05:33,280 --> 06:05:35,280
It's not what

4230
06:05:36,320 --> 06:05:38,160
Um

4231
06:05:38,160 --> 06:05:42,800
What other meats are there? Have you eaten kangaroo yet? No, but I fed it to my cat

4232
06:05:43,760 --> 06:05:45,760
The sell kangaroo

4233
06:05:46,560 --> 06:05:50,640
Okay, I still I'm using bomba bomba warning bomb time

4234
06:05:54,720 --> 06:05:58,480
Oh, he grabbed me. No, this is the wrong tentacle. Stop it

4235
06:06:00,480 --> 06:06:02,480
Parish

4236
06:06:06,080 --> 06:06:08,080
Give him

4237
06:06:13,200 --> 06:06:15,200
Unpopular opinion, you're wrong

4238
06:06:15,840 --> 06:06:21,120
Now you're allowed to argue with me on what your favorite meat is. It's just chicken just tastes so good to my taste buds

4239
06:06:21,200 --> 06:06:23,200
Like it literally makes me

4240
06:06:24,400 --> 06:06:28,560
You know, like I get our a rush of serotonin when I taste that

4241
06:06:29,440 --> 06:06:31,440
chicken

4242
06:06:42,880 --> 06:06:44,880
More more more

4243
06:06:45,120 --> 06:06:52,320
I love chicken. Oh, I love sip my favorite strongy fish that no what I put my feet in the freaking paw to marinate

4244
06:06:53,360 --> 06:06:56,320
A full pork sign one. I've not had that

4245
06:06:58,000 --> 06:06:59,440
Um

4246
06:06:59,440 --> 06:07:03,760
I eat bacon, but I'm scared of pork in general. I know I know irony irony

4247
06:07:04,400 --> 06:07:06,400
But I had the worst

4248
06:07:06,640 --> 06:07:09,520
um food poisoning with pork

4249
06:07:10,480 --> 06:07:17,200
Um, and it's just made me like so wary of it in general like I don't make any food that has it

4250
06:07:18,240 --> 06:07:19,520
Um, I don't order it

4251
06:07:19,520 --> 06:07:25,440
I just I've like although I say that I had food poisoning with chicken because my dad fed me uncooked chicken

4252
06:07:27,280 --> 06:07:29,520
Which was my fault if I'm being honest

4253
06:07:31,920 --> 06:07:33,920
If it's my fault

4254
06:07:34,720 --> 06:07:36,720
Can we blend?

4255
06:07:37,280 --> 06:07:39,280
Mmm

4256
06:07:40,720 --> 06:07:44,320
I get tonkatsu or other pork is fine, but bacon is too short

4257
06:07:47,840 --> 06:07:50,000
Yeah, so the oven

4258
06:07:51,200 --> 06:07:53,040
flame went out

4259
06:07:53,040 --> 06:07:54,640
and my dad

4260
06:07:54,640 --> 06:07:56,640
Served me uncooked chicken

4261
06:07:57,200 --> 06:08:02,080
But because I was such an elite gamer. I never stopped to like

4262
06:08:03,040 --> 06:08:09,920
I don't know. I just thought the chicken was extra juicy and I poisoned myself voluntarily

4263
06:08:12,080 --> 06:08:15,360
Um, and I ate raw chicken by accident

4264
06:08:15,360 --> 06:08:21,440
I was like chicken on the bone and I never looked down to eat like I was watching I was like playing the game

4265
06:08:23,360 --> 06:08:28,320
And uh, you know when it's like being a gamer you don't really stop you just eat with one hand and keep going

4266
06:08:32,400 --> 06:08:34,400
Um

4267
06:08:35,920 --> 06:08:40,560
Not sure if pumpkins are easy to come by in Australia, but you should try pumpkin soup

4268
06:08:41,440 --> 06:08:44,480
Oh, that sounds so cute. What meat goes in pumpkin soup?

4269
06:08:47,360 --> 06:08:49,360
If it's vegetarian, I

4270
06:08:50,160 --> 06:08:53,840
I can't have it well, I can't eat vegetarian food. That's not a problem

4271
06:08:53,840 --> 06:08:59,360
But I need meat in my meals because I'm I'm a weakling. I'm a sickling. Okay

4272
06:08:59,840 --> 06:09:02,800
I'm not very healthy. So I need meat in all my meals or

4273
06:09:05,200 --> 06:09:07,200
You eat raw chicken. Yeah

4274
06:09:07,520 --> 06:09:08,880
and

4275
06:09:08,880 --> 06:09:11,600
So like the outside was cooked but the inside wasn't

4276
06:09:13,200 --> 06:09:18,240
Like the chicken against the bone, but I ate all of it because you know, I was a pain attention. I was like

4277
06:09:19,600 --> 06:09:25,280
And it was marinated as well. So I think it hid the fact that it wasn't cooked properly even better

4278
06:09:26,240 --> 06:09:28,240
The bar

4279
06:09:28,800 --> 06:09:35,120
If I became like a vegetarian or a vegan like for I can't shoot the guy behind us by the way, I'm out of

4280
06:09:35,760 --> 06:09:37,520
I'm out of

4281
06:09:37,520 --> 06:09:41,600
Okay, okay. We're fine. I preemptively choke there. That was my fault. Um

4282
06:09:43,280 --> 06:09:45,280
I'm gonna waste this and it's on myself

4283
06:09:48,800 --> 06:09:51,360
Hmm, uh, you could just use pumpkins

4284
06:09:52,720 --> 06:09:54,880
Oh, you can like roast pumpkin and then put it in

4285
06:09:55,600 --> 06:09:58,100
Nice Johnny. Hi meatland

4286
06:10:00,000 --> 06:10:02,000
Generally pumpkin soup is only veg

4287
06:10:03,680 --> 06:10:05,680
Put beef in it

4288
06:10:06,400 --> 06:10:12,640
Ammo box drought. I keep forgetting. Sorry. I keep forgetting. I don't why I'm forgetting all of a sudden. I'm coming

4289
06:10:13,600 --> 06:10:15,600
Okay, I got it

4290
06:10:17,040 --> 06:10:22,080
If chicken is pink even on the inside do not eat it. It's not good. Yeah, I never paid attention

4291
06:10:22,240 --> 06:10:27,040
And I just inhaled and then I was violently ill for the next 48 hours

4292
06:10:29,280 --> 06:10:34,880
I have really bad history with the food poison. I get it quite often. I didn't even know you could die from it

4293
06:10:35,680 --> 06:10:37,280
um

4294
06:10:37,280 --> 06:10:43,280
I just thought it was like a sickness, but no, you're like entire body is literally like dying

4295
06:10:44,640 --> 06:10:49,200
And I didn't know that and I've been like food poisoning multiple times

4296
06:10:49,200 --> 06:10:51,200
Um

4297
06:10:51,520 --> 06:10:54,960
One was pork one was chicken. Um

4298
06:10:57,280 --> 06:11:04,080
One I don't know if it's food quite well technically. I was working in the garden for my mom

4299
06:11:05,840 --> 06:11:07,840
And I washed my hands

4300
06:11:08,080 --> 06:11:09,440
um

4301
06:11:09,440 --> 06:11:11,440
And I don't know but um, of course you wash your hands

4302
06:11:12,640 --> 06:11:14,640
I did wash my hands

4303
06:11:15,120 --> 06:11:18,240
And I still got sick and that was really bad

4304
06:11:18,240 --> 06:11:24,640
But I don't know if it counts as food poison if it's like has I picked up something from the garden if that makes sense

4305
06:11:26,160 --> 06:11:28,160
Um

4306
06:11:29,440 --> 06:11:33,120
And you say we shouldn't worry about you literally give us read. All right, sorry. I'll stop talking

4307
06:11:33,200 --> 06:11:36,080
I mean, I'm I'm perfectly fine with food now

4308
06:11:36,960 --> 06:11:38,320
but um

4309
06:11:38,320 --> 06:11:39,520
Yeah

4310
06:11:39,520 --> 06:11:41,120
Red meat couldn't

4311
06:11:41,120 --> 06:11:43,120
Okay to eat raw

4312
06:11:43,280 --> 06:11:45,280
Oh, I wouldn't eat anything raw

4313
06:11:48,160 --> 06:11:50,160
On purpose anyway

4314
06:11:52,160 --> 06:11:56,080
Like I seen in japan you can eat eggs raw because they actually don't have

4315
06:11:56,960 --> 06:11:58,240
that

4316
06:11:58,240 --> 06:12:02,400
Thing that makes out that makes the eggs like

4317
06:12:03,200 --> 06:12:05,200
Salmonella

4318
06:12:05,840 --> 06:12:07,520
Who's Sam

4319
06:12:07,520 --> 06:12:11,120
Salmonella, oh not that right now. Who's Sam? Um

4320
06:12:13,120 --> 06:12:15,120
Because they don't have

4321
06:12:16,000 --> 06:12:18,160
Steak tartar is just raw beef

4322
06:12:19,360 --> 06:12:25,520
Notice how they call it something different to not put people off of eating it. I'm curious. That's right. We're on to you

4323
06:12:26,720 --> 06:12:29,440
Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome

4324
06:12:31,920 --> 06:12:36,720
The chickens are taking good care of intensive food, don't they? Yeah, like in japan you can have raw eggs and I'm like

4325
06:12:37,680 --> 06:12:39,680
I don't know. I think maybe because obviously

4326
06:12:40,400 --> 06:12:43,760
You're raised that like oh raw bad

4327
06:12:44,800 --> 06:12:50,720
Raw egg bad and then like going somewhere where it's not it'd be like hard to wrap your head around mentally that it's not like

4328
06:12:51,360 --> 06:12:55,520
Feeding yourself poison or being worried like am I going to get sick later type thing like?

4329
06:12:58,880 --> 06:13:02,800
The only time you can eat raw I would never even voluntarily eat raw chicken

4330
06:13:04,720 --> 06:13:06,720
I'm gonna lie that's the thing

4331
06:13:07,360 --> 06:13:09,360
I

4332
06:13:12,480 --> 06:13:15,520
Notice all these fancy words to trick you into ordering it

4333
06:13:17,760 --> 06:13:20,640
I have a question. What game is this? Is it free? It is

4334
06:13:21,920 --> 06:13:23,920
vermin tide two

4335
06:13:23,920 --> 06:13:25,920
It's on sale right now

4336
06:13:26,160 --> 06:13:30,240
Um, but don't buy it. Just a stream snipe. This is my last round

4337
06:13:30,960 --> 06:13:33,600
And I'm very sleepy and I need my rest

4338
06:13:34,400 --> 06:13:38,800
Unfortunately my my I didn't exist. I didn't think the stream has actually been going for so long

4339
06:13:39,120 --> 06:13:44,320
But not in a bad way just in a I'm I'm sleepy and I'm making soup and I'm going to take a picture

4340
06:13:44,640 --> 06:13:47,920
My soup once it's finished and I hope it works out because if it does

4341
06:13:48,800 --> 06:13:54,240
It means I will have tons of healthy meals that all I have to do is microwave them in a bowl

4342
06:13:54,960 --> 06:13:57,920
All right. No, sorry not microwave them in a bowl. All I have to do is

4343
06:13:58,720 --> 06:14:00,720
Cook them like in a pot

4344
06:14:01,520 --> 06:14:03,520
That would be amazing

4345
06:14:04,560 --> 06:14:06,560
I need to go down

4346
06:14:07,200 --> 06:14:09,200
We'll be happy to see it

4347
06:14:11,280 --> 06:14:13,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's a lot of enemies

4348
06:14:15,840 --> 06:14:24,000
Please have some consideration not very demure not very polite not very considerate grouping up so I can't physically see what's ahead of me

4349
06:14:24,960 --> 06:14:28,000
All right, I'm going up. I don't know what's up here, but I'm going up

4350
06:14:30,640 --> 06:14:32,640
No

4351
06:14:33,040 --> 06:14:35,040
Oh, no, this is the way I'm supposed to go

4352
06:14:36,240 --> 06:14:38,240
I'm freeing the prisoners

4353
06:14:38,720 --> 06:14:40,720
And all the prisoners are free

4354
06:14:47,440 --> 06:14:51,440
I'm talking about rogues from the shell. I think we'll take that and no problem

4355
06:14:51,760 --> 06:14:55,360
Yeah, why is the why is it kicked by our old something's fine?

4356
06:14:57,040 --> 06:14:59,040
I didn't die or get sick so I guess it's fine

4357
06:15:01,360 --> 06:15:03,360
You had raw for it

4358
06:15:03,920 --> 06:15:09,440
My nihongo chozu level isn't good enough to tell what I ate. That's hilarious

4359
06:15:11,280 --> 06:15:13,280
That's honestly

4360
06:15:14,160 --> 06:15:16,160
Hmm

4361
06:15:19,760 --> 06:15:27,520
The one time I ate and got food poison with that pathogen and it made even worse when I found someone's metal tooth cap. Oh

4362
06:15:29,760 --> 06:15:31,760
Wait, how do I get up? Sorry. Sorry. I'm reading in

4363
06:15:33,440 --> 06:15:35,440
Sorry, I'm stalling whoopsie

4364
06:15:36,960 --> 06:15:40,160
I'm coming. I'm coming lay down cover fire lay down cover fire

4365
06:15:41,120 --> 06:15:45,840
I'm laying down. I'm laying down. Oh, I'm blocking. I'm blocking

4366
06:15:51,600 --> 06:15:54,080
I'm swinging I'm swinging. I'm swinging my sword

4367
06:15:58,080 --> 06:16:00,640
You can eat a certain amount of cake batter, but you will eventually get sick

4368
06:16:00,640 --> 06:16:05,600
I got salmon on from roti my grand game one as well. She's just feeling quirky giving you something

4369
06:16:05,600 --> 06:16:08,320
She was like, oh, it's some chess if you're allergic to roti

4370
06:16:09,280 --> 06:16:11,760
Oh, she's just like a quirky little grandma gg

4371
06:16:17,120 --> 06:16:20,960
Imagine having food poison with a cannon ass like moment

4372
06:16:22,240 --> 06:16:28,880
Yeah, it's so better not to eat you can eat raw meat as long as you kill all the bacteria like for blue steak. No, oh no

4373
06:16:30,640 --> 06:16:32,640
Because I am a well done safe

4374
06:16:33,600 --> 06:16:35,200
Steak eater

4375
06:16:35,200 --> 06:16:40,400
There are no eggs. There are no bacteria. There are no nothing on that steak people who eat it

4376
06:16:41,040 --> 06:16:43,760
like blue or rare, whatever

4377
06:16:46,240 --> 06:16:49,760
It's okay to admit that you've got worms because you ate your steak raw, but bruh

4378
06:16:51,520 --> 06:16:54,640
Well done. No, don't vomit at my well done

4379
06:16:55,680 --> 06:17:00,800
Well, there's nothing wrong with well done steak. I will stand here

4380
06:17:01,360 --> 06:17:08,320
Well, I'm sitting but I will sit here and explain to you. There's nothing wrong with it. Okay

4381
06:17:09,440 --> 06:17:11,440
Is it this one? Okay, that's probably back

4382
06:17:14,000 --> 06:17:19,680
Well, yeah, well done steak, you know where it's cooked and there's no raw flesh

4383

Yeah, yeah, I have. Yeah, I have well done steak. Yeah, I don't eat raw flesh. Yeah. Yeah. No, you yeah

4384
06:17:31,520 --> 06:17:35,840
Isn't dangerous to eat well done because of the high temperature produces some chemicals in it. What?

4385
06:17:38,880 --> 06:17:40,880
I'm not even safe to eat steak now

4386
06:17:47,680 --> 06:17:49,680
You did super amazing

4387
06:17:51,440 --> 06:17:55,840
Mommy do a quick poll on steak right now. I will what are the steak types hold on

06:18:02,960 --> 06:18:09,120
How do how do you have your steak question mark?

Answers well done

Uh rare

4392
06:18:21,760 --> 06:18:23,760
Medium rare

4393
06:18:26,800 --> 06:18:31,680
Um medium rare medium well

4394
06:18:37,600 --> 06:18:39,600
Uh

4395
06:18:41,360 --> 06:18:49,600
If I miss someone and then blue I can't even tape blue. I'll just put rare mate as well be blue

4396
06:18:56,320 --> 06:18:58,320
There you go

4397
06:18:59,120 --> 06:19:01,120
Is your poll

4398
06:19:01,920 --> 06:19:04,320
Yes, thank you not having well done

4399
06:19:16,400 --> 06:19:18,400
I'm teasing you before that

4400
06:19:19,360 --> 06:19:22,640
All right, don't let that actually skewer the results

4401
06:19:23,360 --> 06:19:26,880
No, it's skewer or do you actually have it medium rare?

4402
06:19:27,840 --> 06:19:30,080
That needs to redo it and make it medium rare

4403
06:19:33,440 --> 06:19:38,640
The right option is there now everyone is going to take medium rare are your favorite steaks

4404

4405
06:19:45,440 --> 06:19:51,280

4406
06:19:53,760 --> 06:19:55,760
Kind of have nothing that gives me iron

Um, but it's okay if you can't do it because you're not on the pc right now

4430
06:22:01,200 --> 06:22:06,480
Just need to give me a little bit of a minute and now we'll unfriend everyone
