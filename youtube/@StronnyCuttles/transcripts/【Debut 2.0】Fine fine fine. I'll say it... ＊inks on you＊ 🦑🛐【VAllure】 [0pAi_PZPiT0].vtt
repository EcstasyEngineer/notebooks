WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hold on hold on hold on

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
There's not a lot of chance, I will chance my life

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I hope I'm on the right thing

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
And then

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
They're not messed up

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Who's driving this booze?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Come on boys is so messed up

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Valor

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Am I streaming? I don't see it.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
It'll be live for 40 seconds. I can't even see myself.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh, there we go. Hey, I can hear myself.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Ah, I totally lost my voice. Testing.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Ah, freaking scary.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Broke my damn voice on that bloody stream.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Didn't that be alert? Did you like that smoke? Did you like it?

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Right, from here on out, it's nothing but scuffing memes.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
If you're looking for professionals, go elsewhere, buddy.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Go to Shibi's stream. There's no happening here.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
I promise you, mate. My voice is so strange right now.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, my goodness. Just the way we were like,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, it's been a bloody while since we've been together.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Fuck me, man. That took me a year to spawn this.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, my God.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
I did it, though. Holy shit, we did it.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Feet sniffer. I didn't mean to imply greed.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
No, you didn't. I know you didn't. Please don't worry.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Please don't worry. It's fine.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
The only reason I say greed is because of the perspective thing.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
Oh, fucking mischief, reflins. My fucking God.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
What a year it's been. Holy crap.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I know I'm supposed to talk about my debut,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
but let's be honest, we're all reflins here.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, fucking mischiefs.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Of course, your names were going to be refling.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, my God.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
What do you mean you became a squid vtuber

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
just so your name may only reflect you in another life?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, come on. Refling.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Come on. If I'm on a reef, get it?

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Great barrier. Reef. Reef.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, I'm so excited to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with you.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
When this stream ends, I'm going to unlist all my streams.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Any reefers on the track? Are reefers cannabis?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I can't say that.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Does reeflings mean something different?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
In another life, I had a fan base called Reeflings,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
but it was spelled slightly different.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
And I made it pronounced the same, but spelled differently.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Don't worry.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Don't worry.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
If you're not really familiar with me from the past,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
don't worry about it.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Okay, don't worry about it.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm just strong at cuttles. Let's keep it that way.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Thank you very much.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay, am I actually going through my 2.0

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
or are we just squidding around?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
My bottle.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I have my reefing mail.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Skullfish.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, Skullfish is so good.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Oh, that's actually really small.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Thank you.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Right, I'll actually go through my slides,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
but I'm not really sure if there's much of a point,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
because, well,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
that's Johnny's 365 from Beast's Suck It.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Moment.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Product or moment.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Right, let me drink my cola.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Let me drink my cola.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, I was supposed to say 5.3.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Also, someone doubted that Scots is a recognized language.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It is.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
So, you know how it sounds like I'm speaking English here all the time?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm going to give you a sentence, okay?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm going to type it in chat so you can read it.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
So, that is a sentence in Scots that I've just typed, okay?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And it says,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Are you coming to my bit tonight?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
That means, are you coming to my house tonight?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
That's Scots.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
He has a bit different.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
It's not in the best sense,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
but it's what I can think of on the top of my head, but yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Are you coming to my bit tonight?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It means, are you coming to my house?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And I purposely don't really speak with a lot of slang

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
or mumble the way I naturally do,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
because I'm quite naturally monotone and mumbley,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
because the problem is,

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
you guys don't understand me because I'm Scots.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
But if you are British or you're familiar with the Scottish accent,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
then I probably actually don't sound from Scots indeed,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
but it is what it is.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And also, I've been very, like,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
when you're on the internet, you're very Americanised

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
with what you consume.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Does it take all your efforts to pronounce every syllable

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
and not speak Scots?

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
No, my mother dearest,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
she actually taught me,

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
she discouraged me from speaking in slang,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
so I doesn't always naturally come out,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
but here's what it is.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Here's how it was at the beginning.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I said, fucking cheers to that mate, cheers to that.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
But yeah, technically, legally, on paper,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
because I was born in Scotland,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I could speak two languages, thank you.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
I don't need any help from Joe Lingo, let's go.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
But yeah, so I'm a siren that can't sing.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Gee willikers, I wonder why.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I just don't have a voice.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm also tone deaf, by the way,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
so I hope you're ready for drunk karaoke streams.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
That stuff's gonna be intense.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Let's see where these slides are.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
So both of your parents are Scots, eh?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, the band-aids hold up, still top tier.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Yep, very top tier.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Mongolian throat singing.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
The reason I don't like Mongolian throat singing

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
is because cats don't like Mongolian throat singing,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
because of the vibration.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It's an unpleasant sound.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I have learned many traits of cats, so I don't like it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Drunk karaoke.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Shibi's doing drunk ASMR this week.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
If that's your...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Is that your thing?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
To say, is that your thing?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And Scots, you go, is that your thing?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Is that I?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Is that your thing?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Oh, it is him and I.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
There you go.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, I did some basic stuff.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, my lore's being retconned, by the way.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Thanks to you guys.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Apparently, my weaknesses are mirrors,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
which I really fucking like.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm definitely gonna do something with that,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
because I think it's such a cool thing.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I should have done it like a fucking character reference,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
like strengths, weaknesses,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
because that would have been so much cooler to do the havel.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I actually have started reading this year.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I had a really rough year last year.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Gee, I wonder.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And I started...

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I picked up reading.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I have never read in my life.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And...

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Turns out, I really like the stopian novels.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Like George Orwell was so good.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Like Animal Farm in 1984.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I absolutely love 1984.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Fahrenheit was good.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I've read the classics.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm not read that much, but...

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I see you're readin' right?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
The Women in the Dunes, as well,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
is like the perfect, like, book,

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
because it, like, encapsulates, like, human nature.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And...

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I just love, like, depressing books.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I love being depressed at the end and being like,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
no, humanity didn't prevail.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
No, not humanity, what's the word?

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Human nature didn't prevail against the odds.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I've got the Hobbit.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
I've not read it yet, but I have the physical copy of the Hobbit.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And I'm so excited.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Um...

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah, I'm not much of a...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The girls, by far, are more weebs than me.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I am, by far, the gamer.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Like, I played the most games.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Doesn't mean I'm good before anyone fucking complains.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Every time you mention you play games,

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
what do you mean you're not top 500 in this game?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
You suck, like, no, I play video games.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Fucking relax, I bet you're shit at them, too.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Like, my god, can you hear yourself?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
You're actually, like, so fucking negative.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Anyway, I'll help you get more positive.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Actually, the reason why you're negative

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
is because you're KD's negative,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
because you're scrubbing the game.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
That's why you just project.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Anyway, that's just me.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Uh, music, I'm really generic with music.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't listen to music much, okay?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Uh, movies, Lord of the Rings, we're at hell, yeah?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Uh, if you don't know, uh, I have plans for on Christmas

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
and Boxing Day, uh, to watch Lord of the Rings

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
and The Hobbit, Phil Marathon, absolutely adore it.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Uh, that would be public stream,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
no gate keeping, no membership, none of that jazz.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh, special thank you to everyone who watched the debut.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
I already meet the requirements for monetization on YouTube.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
The problem is the stats don't update for, like, 48 hours.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
So I can technically, like, I already meet the requirements.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I just need to submit myself to YouTube.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
And then I can do my monetization stream!

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And I'm so excited, because my idea is so cursed.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
But I just want to say, for anyone who's watching me right now,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
if you don't like VTubers doing webcam streams,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
showing their hands or their feet,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm not a VTuber for you, however FILR Girls, absolutely.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Check them out in the description.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
You can hit subscribe!

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Uhm...

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
But, yes, absolutely no hints to what my monetization stream's going to be.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Uhuhuhuh!

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Mmmhmm?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Mmmhmmmmmm!

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
You ain't ready, I literally need to go to a nail parlor.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I've been growing my nails for three weeks

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
for the monetization stream.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
of having long nails. I hate it, I hate it, but I'm doing it for you.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
Animes, uh, um, Kaki-Guri, still one of my top. Kaki-Guri, Kaga-Guri, Kaga-Guri, still

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
one of my top. It's probably one of my top. I don't, I can't think of anything that.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Actually, fun fact, do you want to know the very first anime I got tricked into watching?

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
Fucking Boku no Pico, or whatever the frickin' Dilla, Piccadilla sauce, whatever the frickin' thing is.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
That is the first exposure to anime I ever had, and I was mortified. Mortified!

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
I had no concept, a little innocent me, tick-tackin' on the keyboard.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Ooh, this anime's being recommended! I should watch it!

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
And then, so I was really dumb, do you know how it has a warning at the start?

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I didn't know what that word meant, like, and I watched it.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I was like, where is this ice cube going?

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
And, like, and actually, I want to use my notice.

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
My first ever exposure to, uh, uh, like an anime that wasn't Boku no Pico, it related, was a brother in...

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Oh my god, ooh! Sorry, I thought there was a spider on me, holy crap.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
It wasn't. It was my cover.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
My first anime exposure, it was either...

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
It must have been an anime based on a manga that got popular, because that's how most anime's turned out, Ida.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
It was a brother and sister. Hold on! Hold on!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Hold the frickin' phone for y'all circle men.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
It was brother and sister, and then it was...

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
The sister is a flesh eater, and the guy's like, oh, it's fine.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
And he has, like, regenerative powers or something?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm sure one of you guys know what it is.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
It was either a manga I read or a thingy, but she had to, like, eat him for some reason,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
and she was like, oh, I'm so sorry for eating you, hum hum hum hum hum.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And I was like, oh!

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah, that was the first of her anime exposure that, like, I got into, and I was like, oh, this shit's crazy.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
And then I discovered what Pururin is.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Many a day on Pururin.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
And then they shut down the website, Rippin' Piss.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
You will be missed, actually. Sorry, my voice is absolutely short.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
I promise this isn't my default voice, it's because I'm so excited to talk to you.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I've broken my voice already.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I came back.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Shut up, Pururin did not come. Hold on.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Hold on, we're doing research like Pururin.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Pururin.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh my god, no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I have, I may have a bikini toggle.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
I may have a bikini toggle for water ASMR streams.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I am so sorry.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I will unbind the keys for an X-treme.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
I will take your word chat that Pururin is back.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
I apologize for that.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
My deepest condolence.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Okay, no.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Okay, I don't even know what to say to that.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Right, move it on, swiftly.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And, swiftly, swiftly.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
We'll take another drink of me, Nikola.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I don't even know what key did that.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Was it you, maybe?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Literally, I look over at my screen and I'm like, where's my Yucata?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Where did it go? Why is it through the window?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Anyway, next, next thing.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Yes, Childhood Games!

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Oh my god, I am so happy that Xbox Game Pass is a thing.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I need to create an account, I don't know what to call it yet.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I want to make it something like Mimi or Funny.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But yeah, anyway, I'm an Xbox kid

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
and if you were able to catch the group stream,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
it's actually true that I had to present games to my dad to buy for me.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Or he would just buy it for me because he was like,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
oh, that's good for response-o.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Inherit your dad's account.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
So, these are the majority of the games that I remember.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I'm going to do tons of Xbox games.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I'm an Xbox kid.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I never had a PlayStation at all.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
So I didn't have access.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I had a PlayStation.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
My dad got a PlayStation 1.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
I didn't know how to read, like, no.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
So I'm just trying to think, like, the timeline.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
A lot of these games I've played, I didn't even have the ability to read yet.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Like, I used to watch my dad play the games because I was so small.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
But yeah, basically.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Sonic Generations.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Is Sonic Generations the one that was made after Sonic Heroes?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I've not played BioShock 2.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
No, I played BioShock 1.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Well, you had bees.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Bees?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
My sweet little bumblebee.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I know what you want from me.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Hypnosis-themed feature where I really like hypnosis.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
I've never done it before, but I'm going to participate in it and try and get it for you.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I never played Sonic Generations then.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
No, I played Sonic Heroes and then there was a bit of a skip.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I played Sonic Unleashed where he's like that werewolf.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
But I got stuck in the game because I was, like, too young.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Not very smart. I'm not a very smart gamer, okay?

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
Which is why I am perfectly happy with

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
hand-holding through games.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Some streamers really don't like backseat gaming.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
For me, absolutely do not mind it.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm daft, okay?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm completely daft.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I have no clue what's going on.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Would we be hypnotised to vote for you as president?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh my god.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
But yeah, so definitely going to replay a lot of Xbox games

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
as my childhood dream was that 100k thingy.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I only had the opportunity to play Fable 3.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Wait, let me see what's behind me.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Hold on. What's behind me?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Oh, Viva Pinata, Trials Evolution.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
Right now my game of choice is The Binding of Isaac.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
It's an absolutely fantastic game.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
It becomes multiplayer in November.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Multiplayer in November.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Just a warning for anyone who is out there

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
binding their Isaac.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
November games, multiplayer games

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
are most likely going to be Isaac.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
I apologise. I too.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The best Halo game in your opinion.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
I'm biased and can say combat evolved

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
because my dad used to play it over and over

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
and I used to hide behind the couch.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I was so scared from the grunty oneies.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
They were so scary.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
You actually finished Meat Boy.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Damn it, like I finished Meat Boy.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
No, I played it. These games don't necessarily mean

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I'm finished them, but yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Hamster's Lifestream win.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah, you want to play a hamster game together.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Is combat evolved the first one?

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, sorry. Halo combat evolved is the first one.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
You're like Crash Land and everyone dies, but you...

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It's just scary.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
They're straight up.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
What in the strip club, straight up binding it

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
and by it, let's just say my Isaac.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh my god, my favourite meme right now

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
is like, replace the A with a F

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
and then it says fart, relax, snowflake.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
It's called Dark Humour. It's my favourite meme right now.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
I've also got those old games

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
from the Xbox original days.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Definitely going to give them a shot again.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
AC actually mentioned that she played

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
American McGee's Alice

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
and I've played Alice in Madness Returns

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and I thought she was going to say

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
she played American McGee's Alice, but...

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
God of War

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
enjoyed that, that was good.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
I need to play Shadow of Mordor properly.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I actually want to play the Golem game

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
that got absolutely review bombed.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Everyone hated it, but I feel like I'm like

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Tismo enough because it's Lord of the Rings

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Lord of the Rings related

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
to play it and the entire time

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I want to do Golem's voice

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
and I'm like, thank you.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I like absolutely wrecked my voice

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
to like roleplay as Golem.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
I mean, you know, we started again.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
I'd love to do that.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
My face when I didn't realise Madness Returns

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
in the sequel.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, mercy, I'm about to ruin your day.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
There was a third instalment called

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Alice Asylum and EA rejected it.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
The game has been fully conceptualised,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
EA rejected it and now it's gathering dust.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
So that's just to ruin your day.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
There was to be a third instalment

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
of Alice in Wonderland and EA, yeah, again, ruined it.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Yay, yay, yay.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Do we hey, yeah? Yeah, we hey, yeah.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Sorry to ruin your day, but that's true.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
What other games?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Dishonoured was good.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Stealth was a bit funny at times,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
but definitely happy to play that again.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I'm gonna burp, I'm so sorry.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, no, I'm not.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I don't have to be professional anymore.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
It's Karambit.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh, my God, what a terrible man.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I heard Monster Hunter.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh, hi, Dempah again.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
How's it going, Dempah?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
I've heard Monster Hunter has bagpipes in it,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
like as a weapon, but it's the most, like, hardest thing to play

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
instead of, like, a sword.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Dishonoured, good, yeah, good.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm drawing while watching you.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Did you guys know that Dempah

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
created her own VTuber art model?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Isn't that amazing?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That's, like, literally so talented.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Talented as in terms of all her hard-working effort

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and blood, sweat and tears that she's put into

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
honing her craft and art.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I read this thing ages ago about artists being, like,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
we don't really like it when you say it's, like,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
overnight talent, because it's not.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's, like, you honed your craft

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and, like, you should be proud of honing your craft.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
You didn't just spawn in as an artist, you know?

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Gifted, that's it, you're not gifted.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
You honed your craft, you spent years on it.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
You got your XP bar raised.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Anyway, that's just my small rant about being nice to artists.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
They aren't gifted, they have spent years

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
specialising into a skill bar, okay?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Thank you.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
More VTuber babies.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Oh, you know what game I really liked?

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
I say this every time is, um, what is it called?

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
College or a ghost alien mode was so good.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I don't care what anyone says.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
It's so very good.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I could for you any young.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
We in boys with Denver.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Denver, Denver.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Sorry, I said it from my voice.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, notice there's no Halo 2,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
because I never got a chance to play it.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
No, there is, is Halo not there?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Wait, Halo 2 should be there.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I played all the Halo's.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Hold on, Analyze, Analyze them in.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Zoom in. Analyzing.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Oh wait, okay, I can grab it.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Where is it?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It's a place for debut.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
There we go.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
Analyzing where Halo 2, Halo 2, Halo 2 unidentified.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Okay, I guess.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I have played all the Halo's.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I wanted to, I've not played the new Red Dead Redemption.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh my God.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Well, it's not new.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It's been out for years now by this point,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
but definitely do Assassin's Creed.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
We're 100% doing Ezio's storyline.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I'm going to be really controversial.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Couldn't be a shite once they killed Ezio off.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I mean, he had three installments.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
It's not like he was killed off.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Wait, what?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I didn't know it fit.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Does that not fit you?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
What?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
You should be there.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Okay, I did it, I did it.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Alien isolation, get to fuck.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
I'm not playing that game.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
That's a terrible game.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Wait, what is?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
That's chat.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
That's not background music.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Halo?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
You need to be above?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah, jeez.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Wait, no, chat.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh my God, sorry.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I'm having a stroke.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
And not the good kind.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Best Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the best Assassin's Creed

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
installment of all time.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I am not taking any questions, statements,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
arguments, or bomb threats to Veiler headquarters.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I'm sorry.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
It's just a bit.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I will explain.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
We're playing it tomorrow.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I will explain to you chapter by chapter,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
step by step on why it's just the most perfect

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
thought out, like, optimized game for, like,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
gameplay.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Just every, I will, I will explain it all.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm actually making a video essay about Assassin's

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Creed Brotherhood.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
It's going to be one of my donuts on rewards.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I've already recorded the footage to do it.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I just need to write the script and everything.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
But, like, I kid you not, I'm doing, like, a video essay

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
40 minutes long.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I don't care.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I'm, like, going to fill Tizmo and Lush.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Okay, we've been on games for quite a while now.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm, like, you guys are probably sick of staring at these

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
games.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Um, how did that not?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
I don't think I've done this wrong.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Hey, hello.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Uh, I think I've said all the games.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh, we're playing old-school Rinske.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Eight hour Assassin's Creed Brotherhood lore coming in.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
What have I done?

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Probably, like, less than an hour.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Um, yes, probably, uh, old-school Rinscape is our weekend

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
game.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
It's going to be mostly a multiplayer game for this month

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
until June 19th when the Eldon...

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
Wait, why the fuck is there two?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Oh, I must have missed one.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Um, you've never played RuneScape.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Don't worry, we're doing questing.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
My only problem with old-school RuneScape is I think you have

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
to pay the premium experience for premium or we're all just

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
going to get shafted playing that game, like, not in a good

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
way.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
Um, but yes, Eldon Ring DLC comes out on the 19th and then

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
the multiplayer game for, like, four days in a row.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I'm doing multiplayer games.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
You need to teach me old-school RuneScape.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Literally, I just go fishing at the back of Lumbridge.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Lummi Castle.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
Not the back, next to the main bit south of the castle.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Um, but I, uh, what was the single word?

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Oh, probably four days of multiplayer Eldon Ring.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
And then I have a very unique stream come in with the first

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
collab outside of Vealor at the end of the month with a

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
feature called Sin Sister.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
And we may or may not have both purchased shock collars,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
which we will give each other control of the shock collars.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
And we are going to play multiplayer Eldon Ring and whoever

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
causes us to die, whichever one causes us to die, gets to

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
shock them, basically.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Yep, we are, we're doing that.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
Um, I believe Sheeby is also getting a shock collar, so I

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
might have some sort of stream with her relating to that.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
Uh, I use the shock collar for FaDempa.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
Um, but yeah, my goals are pretty much.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I want to do a hundred days of my collabs with VTubers.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It's like a challenge for myself.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
I like forcing myself to go talk to people.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Like, I was scared of Dempa, okay, but I DMed her first

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
because I'm a big girl and I was like, hi, I'm 20.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Uh, would you like to say, I was like, oh yeah, would you like to

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
collab with me?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
She's like, fuck yeah, oh my god, that was so good.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So yeah, Dempa based.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Uh, yes, I'm going to put myself out there, talk to VTubers,

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
mingle a bit more because, um, I say my voice is cracked.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I said, well, actually you died zap, true.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
Uh, everything else is explanatory.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Uh, I need to actually purchase the Lord of the Ring book,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
we'll get there, we'll get there.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Okay, this I need help with.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Um, I actually genuinely need help.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I literally have, I don't know if you can hear that.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
I have pen and paper to write down what you guys think.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Do I look like, do I look like I'm not smart?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Wait, hold on, let me write it down.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
General, like, sorry, I'm going to look down every time I do this.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Art.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
Old art.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Mean.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
And obviously you flings or waflings.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
Dempa is intimidating until you realize our tentacles can go.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Hmm.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
You're so, so, so.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Keeping, keep them all as help.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Okay.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Strawing.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Oh, that's actually kind of cute.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Strawing.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah, um, cuddle time.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah, I'm, I'll Dempa, I'm with you.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Like, I just like straightforward stuff.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
Gen, like, strong gen, strong gen, strong live, strong clip,

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
strong art, strong old art, strong meme.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Straw notes.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
Straw notes would make sense.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Snort.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Snort, snort, snort, snort.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
It's not like what, uh,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
it's not like what a swan would say.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Snort.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
Uh, general refers to, um, if you just want to say something,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
like on Twitter, you use that,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
and then, like, I'll read it with my eyeballs.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Straw live.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Straw live.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Honestly, my voice is cracking now.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm not gonna make it.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I can't believe it.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
If I can debut and already did,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
not even 24 hours later.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Strong lure.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
I guess I said.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Ink time.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Oh my god, ink time.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Sorry, ink time for art.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That has to be, that's so good.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Ink time.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Ink time.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I like ink time.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, like a reaction tag.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Strong sea.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Oh!

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Strong seas?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Like I see.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Strong leaks.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I think ink time is good.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Because ink myself is my,

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
my, my other catchphrase.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's not catchphrase at all.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Strong memes.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Strong memes.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Stronetized.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Oh, let's do that.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
The inking.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Anything.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Oh.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Strong bad.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh god, I'm so bad at this.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Strong close.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
I mean, just do what DEMPA said,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
and just, like, strong gen,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
strong live, strong this, strong that.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Ink time was used by a tattoo artist.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Man, tattoo artist out here,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
ruining it for all of us.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
We dafty, we dafty.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I inked myself.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Strong Sina.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Oh, that's actually really good.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Hold on.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
General text, strong Sina.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
I'll just do one N.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
That's so good.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
I've seen you.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Strong Sina.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Strong sake.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
No!

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
No, Vsake.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I'll never beat the Vsake allegation.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Be for yourself.

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
I think Street 4 would meet fans soon.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Mimire.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Mimire.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
It sounds like Namorize.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And I have the memory of a goldfish.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Incredible.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
I'll turn out funny.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Gen can be strong.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
You know what?

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
Any mention of my absolutely horrific

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Strawfish.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Stratustive.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Strawfish.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
God, I'm so bad at this.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
I'll think.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I'll need to freaking cook on it more.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
I don't want to be stuck.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Smallfish.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Oh, smallfish is really good for all art.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Oh, yeah.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Smallfish.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
I'm putting that down.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
I hate when you have to like TTL.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
E?

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh, I did too many of them.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
What's that?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I can't read it right properly.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Yet my entire career is based on it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Hell yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Okay, we'll move on.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
I'll come back to it.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I'll cook a little on my own.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Obviously, Squishy Gold pretty much.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
He did designs, lores.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
There's actually full lores, Will.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
I can't read it right now because my voice is perishing.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Um, what else?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Mascots.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
All the mascots were made.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
If you didn't know the reason,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I'll heal your throat with your tentacles, please.

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
The reason why reeflings have a patch on their head

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
is a nicotine patch to help you with your addiction.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
We have an addiction to each other.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
So that's why you have a nicotine patch.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
And you have lovely tentacles.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
I've already got lots of suspicious artwork of us together,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
but it's for November, so I can't post that.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Yeah, Tamachi absolutely cooked on the lores.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Background, yeah, I love my room.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Odd's Top was such a good sport.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I literally sent them a DM.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
I'm like, hey, can you base it off of Sonic OST?

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
And he's like, yeah, sure.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Waltz with me.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
He did my little banner that's on Twitter,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
which is really good, absolutely.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
Azura could help you all with her healing properties.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Oh really?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, Small Sushi, she did great.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Small Sushi actually, she did fantastic

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
because the girls weren't fully conceptualized

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
when she created them.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I basically just gave descriptions,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
which was really rough.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I know you haven't seen my stingers

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
for my scene transitions.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I hate stingers.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I spent like $200,

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
and I don't even want to use them.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
I bought it, obviously I bought it for everyone else,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
but I'm like, why did I spend that money on me?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I don't like using stingers.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I just went straight into it.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
And my loading screen was so expensive.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
Actually, Umi cooked with the loading screen.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
She's actually making another alternative version

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
because I had to do that cover-up thing.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
But that was very expensive as well.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I just want to get in there.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
And then obviously why I picked my gen.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
That was so fun to do.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
Everyone's like, oh, this is my first impression.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
No, motherfucker.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I picked them.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Oh, so fun.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
It was so fun being able to say that

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
and being like, yeah, yeah.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Absolutely adored it.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Evil strongy be like, I always use stingers.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I love stingers.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I love when VTubers have 10 minutes of stream starting soon

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
at the start of their streams.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Perish, absolutely perish.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Nonsense.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
I'm starting up on a brotherhood at the menu tomorrow.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Mark my words.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
But yes.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It was just fantastic.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
The girls, it's hard to judge people when they apply

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
because it just felt really...

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
weird.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Hold on.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Hold on.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
Yeah, it felt weird trying to put them on

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
because some of them said put me on any model.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Some of them said I wanted a specific model.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
I think Azura got who she wanted.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
She be...

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Hmm.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Mercy wanted AC.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
AC wanted AC, so AC got AC.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
Amy, did Amy say anyone?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Anyway, it's impossible to give people the outline

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
that they wanted because they couldn't even see it.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
They couldn't even see it.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
It was just an outline.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
Did you have any awkward or weird applications?

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Someone's intro video was 30 seconds.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
For anyone watching, if you're serious about joining

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
a VTuber agency, what you're supposed to roughly do

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
in an application introduction video

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
is to say your accolades,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
whatever you achieved as a streamer

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
prior to what you're doing now.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
So you mention how often you stream.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Do you stream three times a week consistently?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Good thing to mention.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
30 seconds.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
It was like, hi, I'm...

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and I stream on and that was it.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
And I was like, bro, what am I supposed to do with that?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
But yeah, you're supposed to say your accolades,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
what you want to achieve within the agency,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
is a good thing to mention.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
You're also supposed to pass the test

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
where you say hi, Valor, at the start

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
because that means you read the instructions properly.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
If you didn't start with hi, Valor,

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
I didn't close your application right away.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
I gave you a chance, but it's kind of one of those tests

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
where those who did it, I know you read.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Those who didn't, either, you forgot.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Although I say that,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
I mean, the girls have given me permission

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
to kind of talk about the thing.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Azura's application was unprofessional.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
Fuck, I'm not even going to be around the bush with Azura.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
She gave me permission to talk about it.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
In her introduction, she was like, hey, I'm Azura.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
And she was like, I really don't like pickles

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and I don't like mustard.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
And I was like, Azura, this is your introduction video.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
You're supposed to tell me things you've achieved.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
She's like, yeah, I don't like the taste of these certain foods.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
And I was like, you're perfect for the hag, and you come.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
You're perfect for the doting hag

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
that we've got no competition.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
I say, doesn't even, English isn't even her first language.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
She had the most professional application.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
She had these massive paragraphs, serious answers.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Amy was a dafty.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
She freaking forgot to edit one part of her application.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
And in one of the answers,

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
she was like, I want to diddle the other girls.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
And I'm like, I knew it was an oversight

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
because everything else was professional.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
I'm like, any one earth have you put.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
She failed the high vealure.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
Mercy must have watched her introduction video

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
like 30 times over.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
She was so like, she went above and beyond.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
She actually created Icy.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Like recreated her outline and named her and all of that.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Pocha, Amy left that on purpose.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Yeah.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
The introduction video gives me a very good hint

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
to what kind of beach over you are.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
No, what kind of person you are

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
because there's one thing to stream,

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
but when you're talking directly to someone who's assessing you,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
you act a bit different.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
And yes, it was very interesting.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
It was very interesting.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I got serenaded so much.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
So I don't know why I'm frog blinking.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Let me just give me one second.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
She's going to totally not recalibrate in the old mech.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Hold on.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
That's very calibration.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah, I got serenaded.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
So many people were singing.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I'm like, you don't have to sing to be in this agency.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
You just need to do one cover song of it.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I'm not going to force you to sing.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
Probably one of the most frustrating things

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
was we asked to have streaming history

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
and people's evidence of being a streamer

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
was like a link to their Twitter and no other thing.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Oh no, content creator.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
That was the terminology used.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You have to be a content creator.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
And it was like, are you okay?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Why are you linking your Twitter?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Twitter isn't content.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
There weren't even a v-tweet or anything like that.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
And it was just like...

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Are the girls doing more songs?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Yes, 100%.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
If the girls want to pursue more singing,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
they just come to me and tell me what they want to do.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
And I get that she don't.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Well, other things.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Obviously, I'm not going to say anything private.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm very flattered.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
There were some very big names that applied,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
but they just weren't a good fit.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Or they already had a pre-established brand

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
and it was like, is this really what you want?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I think you just want to...

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
I think some people that were very high notoriety

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
were interested more in the manager side of things

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
than actually being at the other.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
We had like one person who was fricking massive

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
and they were like, can I keep my IP and join you?

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
And I'm like, sorry.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
I need to own the rights to the models

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
in order to do what we need to do.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Okay.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
It was a shame,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
because I'm sure that person would have done just fine,

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
but it's not possible to not have the IP

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
and utilize the girls.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Yes, it was in the facts on the page.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
The website got so many fucking questions

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
that were answered on the website,

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
so they had to ignore the tab that had all the information

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
to go to the contact part of the website

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
to then ask the question,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
that was already on the website.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
Literally, I tried so hard to make that ship

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
be as comprehensible as possible.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
Yes, I think the applicants definitely read through it all.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Reef time.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Oh, I can't say that.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Sorry, I'm not...

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
That's the code name.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I did not say that word.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Please don't get on me.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm just trying to think back

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
because there's anything notable on the applications.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Oh my God!

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
There was one application.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
She was outrageous.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Outrageous.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
If you apply to an agency,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
that agency watches your content.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
This girl, my goodness,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
she applied.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
I went on her Twitch to listen to her live

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
to check her out and all of that.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
She admitted in the next live stream,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
oh, I'd only do Vialure for one year

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
and then bring my audience over to this account.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
Why would you admit that out loud?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I'm very happy to see it.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
I never even considered her,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
but oh my God, how could you be so...

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
I don't even know what the word is.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I was gobsmacked.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I sent it to other members of the team

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
to make sure I heard what I heard was correct.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
But they outright said,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
yeah, I would just do it for one year

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
and then bring my audience over.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Dog.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Thank God I didn't waste.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
Waste a slot for you.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
I am very happy to say that all current talents

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
have given very high indications

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
of staying at the agency, you know,

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
as long as income is all good and dandy.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
So please do support them via Patreon

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
or monetization streams when the girls get monetized.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
But yes, I was absolutely gobsmacked.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
One to even apply to do it in the first place

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
knowing you have no commitment,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
knowing that we're like 80, 20 split,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
everything's in your favor, 100% merch,

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
and saying that you're not even going to be, like, dedicated.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Oh my God.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
And then to admit it,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
to admit it,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
knowing you submitted yourself and the agency

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
is watching over you.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Oh my God.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Absolutely gobsmacked.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Oh.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Anyway,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I will repeat again,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I am very happy to say that all girls

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
have given indications of long-term commitment,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
if you will.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And as well as,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
if they sign on for one more year,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
like another year,

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
the split goes 85 to them,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
15 to the agency,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
and they also get an alternative outfit on us.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
They do not pay for it, we pay for it.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm glad she was honest, I didn't waste her time.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
She was honest in her stream,

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
she was not honest on her application form,

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
to fill all of that out in mislead and be like,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I'm just going to quit after a year,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
just go,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I actually spat in real life

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
and that landed on my phone.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Don't do that, don't fuck with me.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
I put a lot of love into this.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Women lie, I can't believe it, that's terrible.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
You know you can't say that,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
that's the concept artist by the way,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
don't believe the thing that comes out of his mouth.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I'm jealous of the phone.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
I didn't know she was going to do that bit

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
on her debut, where she was like,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
I gasped, I was like, oh my god.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Just so you guys know,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I didn't have anything to do with her debuts,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
they all did it themselves.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
I was like, oh my god.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Anyway,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
oh,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
2.0's over, right, show's over folks.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Um,

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm a bit jealous.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Right, I'm going to open up Marshmallow

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
because this time I can answer a question.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Please keep my UKatha on.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I don't know what letter did it,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
but I can actually answer Marshmallows that are,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
um,

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
why are you so cute? Stop it,

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
my voice is so freaking broken.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Have you considered streaming elsewhere?

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
Yes, the girls are allowed to stream on an alternative website

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
at a later date.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Please understand,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
we are trying to establish yourself on YouTube at first,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and we have monetization on YouTube,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
and the girls' income is all sorted.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
But yes, there are plans.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
I will make it free access.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
I do not believe in charging any further

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
than, um,

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
YouTube membership and Patreons all together

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
at $9.99 for your OSHI desk to support,

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
because it is $1.99 for emotes

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
to make sure no one gets gifted membership.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
And then is it $4.99, or is it $3.99?

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
My voice is broken.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
Is it $4.99 for membership?

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Usually.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Is $4.99, yeah, $4.99 seen agreeable.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Okay, $1.99 for tier one, $4.99.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Yeah, that sounds right, that sounds right.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Um, as long as you guys don't think it's outrageous,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
like in this day and age.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Um, as I've said in the Veil or Smoothstream,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
we are undercutting the market.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
Um, I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
On the VA side of things,

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
most VA's start at $10 for two exclusive audios.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
We are undercutting the market by doing

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
four audios for $5.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
And no price increase at all is planned.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
And if you feel ever so inclined,

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
you can donate more via, donate.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
You can support more via Patreon.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.000
There is a secondary tier that is $20, I believe.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
I haven't put anything else in place.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Um, yes.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
What's your history with hypnosis?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I'm learning, I'm a new baby.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Um, but I'm going to give it my best shot.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
I have a very deep interest in it.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
I've just never actually made content about it, like, straight up.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
It's not expensive, yes, I...

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Oh, I really, I've heard some stories

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
around that it was going to be $5 for standard and $20.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Oh, no, no, we're undercutting the market.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
$5 and you get four, four audios per month.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
Um, are you concerned undercutting could cause a scene?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Wide price shift downwards?

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
No, because prices are going up everywhere.

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
Um, following the voice actress trends

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
and the ASMR side of things and the role play side of things,

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
prices are only going up and I believe in the opposite.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
I believe in delivering both quality and quantity.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Um, without overworking the girls, please understand

51:59.000 --> 52:05.000
that management have dictated the scripts for a couple of months.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
However, there's few girls interested in writing their scripts.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
I'm also very open to writing scripts live.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Unfortunately, there will be a membership stream.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
For me, content-wise, to give you guys exactly what you're looking for.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Um, but please understand, I cannot pigeonhole the girls

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
into doing the same thing over and over again.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Just rehashed, that's not, that's not, um,

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
that is no way for them to be set up for success.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
That is, they will be set up for failure, sadly, if I did that

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
and I really hope, uh, yeah.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Have you written any scripts yet?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Yeah, you listened to them.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
Everything that's out right now on Patreon is done by me.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
The two other script writers kick in, I want to say roughly in three months

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
and then the manager for the scripts is about to kick in.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
I don't know quite what's happening yet, if they'll write the majority.

53:05.000 --> 53:11.000
Um, this is just my humble opinion, but because I don't have...

53:12.000 --> 53:19.000
My scripts do not come out as best as if a man had written it.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
That's just my opinion.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
Um, the Emmy has shown interest in a script,

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Shibi has shown interest in writing.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
I think Azura prefers the help.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
Azura, um, I think she needs reassurance.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
AC is good at improv.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
Uh, I think she may do some improv scripts in the future.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Uh, yes.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
What is the adult aspect to the agency?

53:53.000 --> 53:59.000
Uh, the alternate, alt-twitters and, uh, Patreon.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Yeah.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Azura did good.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
She did.

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
I eventually want to be a member for all the girls who girls deserve their fans.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
Uh, yeah, I'll kind of repeat this.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
If you, like, are in a position where you can support, like, one girl,

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
please think about supporting the other girls over me.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
Um, I am living a very good life, um, and things are going very well.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
Please don't worry about me, okay?

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
How do you find the alternate of twitters?

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Check who they're following?

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
Yeah, check who they're following.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Question about your design.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
How did you come up with the twin tails?

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And the candy piece is seashells!

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm a cuttlefish, I'm a sea beacherber.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
Uh, these are cuttlefish, uh, sorry, these are seashells.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
Uh, and then I got double bunches.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
Um, I love symmetrical hair, and I love bunches, so I got double bunches.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
Um, would you be open to accepting script submissions?

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
Absolutely, I don't know how to set it up, I don't know how to do it,

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
and I don't know, I need, I would need to, like, give a guide,

55:21.000 --> 55:31.000
because it's quite hard behind the scenes to get it all efficient and good to go, but yeah.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Definitely open to it.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
Please do let us cook though, like, literally the dust is settling,

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
the girls are about to start doing game streams after these 2.0s.

55:41.000 --> 55:48.000
Um, the first week I did request the girls to stream as much as they're physically able to

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
without cancelling streams, I have emphasised to them that cancelling streams,

55:53.000 --> 56:01.000
try your best to not over promise, it's better to take a day off than it is to

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
um, plan a stream that you think you can do and then you get too tired and cancel it,

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
because cancelling streams is very, people plan, people plan their time and their days

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
and their energy around a stream if they know what time it's coming on,

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
and it's very valuable to respect people's time.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
So, like, for reeflings, for example, you guys know that I don't stop streaming,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
like, at all, and I'm always there, and I literally have never cancelled a stream, so.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
And that's true, I haven't cancelled a stream.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Mm-mm.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
Um, sorry to tie it, just to bring the topic back.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Gifted membership is the one that's closest to $5, yeah.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
You may have to go higher.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Eh, eto?

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
I thought gifted membership went to the lowest tier, tier one was gonna be emotes only,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
and then tier two was gonna be $4.99.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
Ah, I really don't wanna overcharge.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
So there is gonna...

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Well, wait, more streams?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Yeah, I stream all day every day, baby.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Just make it an extra dollar.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
Eh, it's expensive though, it's expensive.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Eh, who goes there?

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
By the Pope.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Identify yourself.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Um...

57:42.000 --> 57:52.000
I literally said in the interview, you're not gonna get in trouble, I'm not your mum.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I couldn't give less than two shits what you do.

57:54.000 --> 58:00.000
I basically said the only thing I ask you not to do is release any NDA content,

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
and, you know, don't say the N word.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
You know, basic adult stuff.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's pretty much it.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
When you treat adults like adults, they act like adults.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
It's crazy.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Did you hypnotize the girls to become the characters?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Eh, I hope you're drinking a lot of soda.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Ah, I'm going cola.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
It's fizzy juice, actually.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Sorry, you're turning Scots.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
It's not soda, it's fizzy juice.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Um, yes.

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
As for repercussions, like I said, we don't do suspensions.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
However, I did warn them.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I said, doesn't mean you're allowed free reign.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Like, we can cut, we can terminate.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Obviously, we don't want to do that.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
And no girl has given any indication of any of that shit.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Thank God.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I have full faith in these girls.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
I've known them for two months now.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
No issues.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Not one issue has popped up.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
Oh, yeah, fizzy juice is how you say it in Scotland.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Are you a hire up in the agency?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
No.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I said, don't call me boss.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
I basically got their script started,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
but it's going to a script manager.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
And I don't have to do any work.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I get to stream all day long.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Um...

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Yeah, someone kind of asked about Gentoo.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
A year away, bro.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
A year away.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Do you plan on doing movie watch alongs?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Absolutely.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Well, you ever do a deep sea creature list?

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Oh my God, yeah, that's so good.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
That's a good idea.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
I like that.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I was going to...

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So this is a failed stream idea.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I was actually going to order, like, a cuttlefish.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It wouldn't be alive,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
but I wanted to explore the biology of it

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
because I think they're pretty cool.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Like cephalopods are pretty cool.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And I wanted to, like, show you guys, like,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
there's a thing.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
If I was a cuttlefish, I'd say, look, looks good.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
But I think people would find it a bit more

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that I'm, like, essentially playing with a dead body.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
So...

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yeah, probably can do that.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I've not played Subnautica.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I don't have a memory of playing it.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Could give it a good shot.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I could recommend it.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But it's for science.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Cephalopog!

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
For memes?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
For memes?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Cephalopog.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Sorry.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
My tag now,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
as long as no one's yoinked it.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Let me scroll up so I can see the spelling.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Thank you!

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Yoinkers!

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
My tag now!

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Which tags are missing?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I've got strong Sina for general.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I've got smuttlefish for all

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and cephalopog for memes.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So I need live clips and art.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Cracked it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Literally didn't even have to come up with it myself.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
What a genius.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Hee hee.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Let me refresh my...

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I scroll down a bit, actually.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
As long as they're respectful,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I'll actually use it for educational content.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah, I like biology,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
but I think people find it quite morbid sometimes.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I don't want to upset anyone.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I can't believe you're already taking advantage of me.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
True.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You like it, really?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I've missed taking advantage of you.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
What a refund.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Tentacles.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I don't have any tentacles.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I may get tentacles another time,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
but I don't have tentacles.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I feel like if I had tentacles,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
they would come out with my...

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'll be honest,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I don't think they would be tailbone attached.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I think they would come out with my other end.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Out of all the girls,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
who do you think is going to overwork themselves for Sheebie?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Sheebie's already done so much work in advance,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
so she can focus on streams.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Um...

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
The tentacles not be around you.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Oh my god, someone took the Scottish coffee pasta.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
What do you think of that, Mr. Pajama wearing

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
basket face, slipper wielding...

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I hate...

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
The only thing I don't like about Marshmallow

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
is that it cuts words in the middle.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Like...

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Tentacles.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Ooh, that became cool.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Do any of the girls have any talents,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
which is a surprise to you?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Emmy, please, piano for real, for real.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Um...

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Mercy...

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
has acting.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Um...

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Is there a draw?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Sheebie actually draws as well,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and Mercy and Emmy,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
and A.C. Doodle.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Um...

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I think they all draw,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
and I'm like, fuck Nella.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
These are all talents, and what do I do?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I just sound like a backpipe.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Hipstone, like, that's good.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Um...

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Will the talents keep their silver playbots?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Of course, Jesus, why would I keep that?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That's disgusting.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Absolute disgusting behaviour.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
All their hard work, and I keep the playbutton.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Absolutely not.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Oh my God, someone said an hour ago,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
when will auditions be open for Gen 2?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I am hot and ready like a little

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Caesar's Pizza.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Come and scoop me up before a rich man does.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I've spotted an American...

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Bevin' on.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Um...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Mimi on reflex.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Oh my God, I need to make a reflex...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
post...

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
on my alternate arm.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
My voice is so loud.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Mummy, thank you for giving me a little sister.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
You talked prior during the selection process

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
about keeping a list...

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
a list of possible candidates,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
so I got my first choice for everyone.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I don't know how,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
but everyone was like first choice pick.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I wanted them in the agency, they came in the agency.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
There were...

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I would say like...

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
eight people...

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
that were like...

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
all back.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Obviously Azura didn't have one,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
that was a problem.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Emmy, I was actually really worried

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
she wouldn't accept her board.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
She likes it.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I was worried that she wouldn't accept the board.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And she was like, yeah, that's fine, I don't care.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I was like, okay, then jeez, jeez.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I was worried she wouldn't accept that.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Have any Japanese carpo's influenced

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
your decision making?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Why do you believe there was

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
no lid one before?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
No idea.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Probably because

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
you need someone who's done it

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
before to even understand

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
what to do.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
A lot of guy owned corporations

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
in the nicest way,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
most likely haven't been streamers before

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and don't comprehend what you're asking

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
people to do.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I kind of spoke about this a wee bit

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
in the last stream.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
That 80-20 split,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
in order to motivate people,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
you have to let them earn what they're worth.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
If you turn around and say to them,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
for every $100

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
you're getting

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
20 bucks out of it, you're getting 50 bucks out of it,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
all that girl

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
is going to be doing is sitting there

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
saying, oh wow,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I could have made the full 100 on my alt account.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Oh wow, I could have done this on my previous life.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
That's all that they're going to sit there

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
and think.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
We're talking pure business, baby.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I'm happy to talk pure business if you want.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Well, the monthly audio releases

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
be revealed before the month starts.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yes, we need to

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
get on top of that.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Sadly, there was a few issues

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
production wise

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
with a few things.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Surprise, surprise, turns out,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
takes a lot of time to make these things happen.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Love artists, but my fucking god,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
can you not go over deadlines?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
That'd be great.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
But yes, we

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
will be posting monthly

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
what the tags are,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
what the title is.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
We just need to catch up.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
You need to give us time to breathe.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I'm so sorry, all I can ask is your patience.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Unironically, bow emoji

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
because

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
we need time.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
It was absolutely hectic

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
on debut.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
We were exhausted in that group collab

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I don't know if you recognise

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
how fast we ended.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I was like, right, say bye to chat, bye.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
We all

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
disappeared out of that voice call so quickly.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I was like, thank you guys so much.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I'm going to wait a pass out.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And then I ended up being really sick after it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But yes,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
we just need things to calm down.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
We're going to ease into the first week.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Everyone's got their games. You get to see their personalities

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
more, enjoy them more, which is fantastic.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
We know that.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
octopus.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'm not an octopus.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I'm a cod-o-fish.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
No call me octopus.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
No call me squid.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I'm a cephalopod

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
or a cod-o-fish.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Better take your yourselves.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And now the things have calmed down.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
The lead up to debut is very nerve-wracking.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Like, very, very nerve-wracking.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I have finished my cola.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I will now start on

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
my warble.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Astronaut, you're so friggin...

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Hey, you like my teeth?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Is that what I was doing it for you?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I think I've caught up a little bit.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I don't know.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I lied.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Is there a reason you went with YouTube over Twitch?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Yes, I can manage the girls' accounts from YouTube.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I cannot manage the girls' accounts from Twitch.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I can't do a thing on Twitch,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
management-wise.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Twitch, unfortunately,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
are very sparse and arbitrary

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
when they

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
throw the old ban hammer down

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
or suspension hammer down.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Really not a fan of Twitch doing that.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Every week you see

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
a girl being like, Twitch with a heck.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm literally doing everything

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
that everyone...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I'm doing stuff that everyone else does.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Like, it just...

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
At least with YouTube,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
you can beg them on Twitter

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
for help or whatever.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Twitch is inconsistent, yeah.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Let's see.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Would you dominate

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Inkling?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I've never played Splatoon.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Isn't it actually good?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It's probably the most lore-friendly

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
game for me to play.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
How does managing accounts...

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yeah, so I have a...

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
It sounds really bad, but I don't do anything

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
on their accounts, but

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I can basically go on their accounts

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and set up streams for them

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
or approve comments for them.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Anything they want to help out, really.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Now that

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
debuts have happened, the girls are

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
going to be controlling all that stuff.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
They'll be doing their live streams and stuff,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
but in order to reduce as much

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
stress as possible on the girls,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I pretty much try to do every single

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
little thing, but

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
now that we're past the debut stage,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
they're going to have to be big girls

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
now and, you know,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
put up their little games,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
put up their streams

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and all that and update their description.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Like, I was the one doing

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
all that behind the scenes.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Have you played Pokémon? Yeah, Pokémon Ruby.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
My childhood game.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Um...

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Mudkip was my starter.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
They have to spread their big girl wings.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yes, I like putting a message in the

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Discord. I'm like, I'm so sorry girls,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
but the hand holding kind of

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
slows down now.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Um...

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Oh yeah.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Say hello out.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It was torturing.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Blaziken is so strong

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
and so is Mudkip. Mudkip's really strong

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
as well.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Mudkip's always used in speedruns

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
for Pokémon Ruby or Emerald.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
She doesn't know

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I want to collect her ink. Oh my god.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Inks on you.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Strony is mum a bird, but it's time for them to flee the nest.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Honestly, like,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
um, I hope

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
overall they feel like less stressed.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Like, um...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
They didn't have to think

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
about the lures or what they wanted to say.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Everything was edited on their behalf.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Like, they had to give the audios over,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
everything was done on their behalf.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Because like, I've heard stories

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
of, like, other

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
agencies, like,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
go to the talent, right, make up your lure.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
We've ordered all the art, but you make up the lure, by the way.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And it's like, what?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You literally are handing me the model. What do you mean you've not

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
thought this stuff? And it was like, quick

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
come up with a description of your character really quickly,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
quickly, quick, quick!

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And it's like, what?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You're giving me the model.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
What do you mean I come up with this stuff?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Like, that's the whole point of the model, unless it would be customized?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Like, it's just like, fuck.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Um...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
How did you

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
end up managing them? Or are you new to the agency?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Well, I'm new to being a manager. I'm not even their manager.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I'm just a streamer that does it alongside them.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I just picked them!

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
But, but me?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Me? Nah, I'm on Assassin's Creed.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I'm fucking being a boss. I ain't doing

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
shit.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Um...

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Um...

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I know this isn't...

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Someone said it! Someone said say

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Purple Burglar Alarm! Got it!

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I knew someone was going to say it. I always

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
get asked this. Right.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So in my, like, clear accent,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I say Purple Burglar Alarm.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
But if I say it in a harsh Scottish accent,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Purple Burglar Alarm?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Like, my tongue gets caught

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
on the top of the roof of my mouth. Wait, I'll mute

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
my background music so you can really hear it.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
My tongue gets caught.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Purple Burglar Alarm?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Like, ooh!

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Purple Burglar Alarm?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
You can hear my tongue getting caught.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Say it, huh?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Hmm...

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Uh-uh...

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Sorry, Paul.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Uh...

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
What did you miss? Nothing.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It's just me memein' about...

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Are you all trying to keep non-conflicting

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
schedules? Sadly, it's not

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
possible when someone like me is on the team.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Um, so whenever

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
a gen mate of mine goes

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
live, I will highly recommend

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
you go watch them. Cause right now, for example,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Shiba Cottenbom is live doing her 2.0.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Uh, Azura is coming

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
on in roughly three hours.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Um, but sadly

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I am an endurance streamer

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and the best time slot that I have selected

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
means that I can go to doctors' appointments

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
even if I do. Um... No, I'm not dying!

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Before anyone freaking types that

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I'm fine, my health is good.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Um...

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Uh, it's all good. Don't worry.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Um, but the time slot

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I have chosen means that I can still go out

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
to do things like go shoppin

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
or to a doctor's appointment

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
or, um,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
you know, go feed gammy, you know how it is.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I'm not dying!

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Stop! My health is so much better.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Although I do have a sad story.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I mean, I won't say it in 2.0

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
even though it's just

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
our wealth.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Nah, nah, I'll keep it to myself cause it's a bit sad

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
and I don't want to make you guys sad.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Like, this is such a good happy time. Like, holy fuck, we're back.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Um, after a year

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
goddamn, that took so long to cook!

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
But we're here!

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Strongly cut.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Me, that's just my name.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Admitted, that's just my name.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Um...

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
But yeah, sadly I am an

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Endurance streamer which means

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
weekly I will most likely have very long streams

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
that are not

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
friendly to the majority of viewers.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Please understand, do not feel

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
bad.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
If you are unable to watch me

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
live.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The other girls

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
might be much more accessible to you

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
time zone wise or stream wise.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I can still hear her

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
fuck!

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
But I play, I absolutely

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
do not feel insulted at all

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
if you cannot

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
you know, keep up with me.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I'm not very friendly, my time zone

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
isn't friendly, I am aware of that.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And cause I'm an Endurance streamer, like, tomorrow's stream

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
is literally

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
8 hours long.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I'm not even kidding. We're doing the full play

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
through of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
and then we're going back to 100% it

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
cause I've never 100%

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
in the DNA sequence since Assassin's

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Creed Brotherhood before. Like, that's what

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
we're doing the next day.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
What do you mean? I thought you were just debuting.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So yeah,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
that's why

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
whenever a gen mate

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
goes live, please, you are more than welcome

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
to tell me. I will direct

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
you guys to the gen mate cause I can't

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
redirect cause my stream, my gate

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
if my stream isn't over.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So full play through

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
first day is planned, yes, and then 100%

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
the next day, I don't know how long it's

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
gonna take, but yeah.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
8 hours isn't

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
gonna be the norm every single stream

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
so like, for example,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
for example

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
needy streamer overload

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
is

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
2 hours long, I think.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I've never played the game before

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I think it's just a click simulator

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
type thing. I'm not sure.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I've also got

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
however, actually

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
James Cameron's

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
avatars an 8 hour

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
stream, sorry.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Old school

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
RuneScape is like 12 hours, oh god.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
These are all so long.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I need to make up for lost time.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I need to make up for lost time.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Not to mention, once I get

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
membership, once I get monetized

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I'm also doing membership streams

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
on top of all of this.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
8 hour stream on Saturday

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and then

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I'm trying foreign sweets.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It is gonna be like a

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
like a desk

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
camp. Oh, yeah.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Oh, you get to see my desk, man.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
When do you

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
rest?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I will rest until I'm dead.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I've waited a year to be here.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I have lost time to make up for.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
People have waited

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
in cryo freeze for me for a very long time.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And the way I say

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
thank you is

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
rather than saying thank you

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
is like doing it through content, through ASMR,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
through collabs, through everything.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
So, yeah.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I'm

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
making up for it. Oh, no.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Someone says

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
don't burn out, please.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I have a secret for you.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I have this thing, your honor.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's called rautism.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And it means I actually don't

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
experience burnout.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I don't experience it.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I basically

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
go to sleep and wake up the next day

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
and I'm ready to take on the world again.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I've never really felt

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
what burnout is, the way people describe it.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I think

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
my autism has given me a buff

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
means I don't get burnout.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And I'm very excited to stream every single day.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It's a superpower.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Yes, for the foreign sweet stream,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
again, that's hand cam.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You'll see my hands. So, if you don't like VTubers

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
that can show

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
a wee bit of the flesh. Do apologize.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I might not be for you. However, do have

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
gen mates that are a little shy

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
and I don't think they'll show themselves.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
So, please be patient.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I'm autistic.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Don't send me a picture of my face

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
with the hat right now.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So, I can make it my twitter

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
profile picture right now.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I need to make it my twitter profile picture.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Strontism.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Strontism is...

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Oh, should that be my life tag?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Because I don't get burnout.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Strontism.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Oh, that's really bad though. I feel like

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
you're making fun of autism. I'm like

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
one shut the fuck up. I literally

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
have sweaty hands and feet all day long.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Like, fuck you.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
You gotta throw a swirl at them.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Swirl at them.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I like that hypnosis swirls. It's like this thing

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
you swirl on a desk and then you're like

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
strontism.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Life tag strontism.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I can blame you guys if someone's like

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
oh my god, you're making fun of autism.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Shut the fuck up.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Anyway, I don't think anyone's

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
going to watch me that's like that anyway, so.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Never seen a work horse.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Ooh.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I guess it's even better than this

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
when the memberships come out.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Strontism is...

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
shit in Dutch.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Ain't no way.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Ain't no way I name

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
myself Kaka in Netherlands.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Netherlands.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Netherlands Praten.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Nee jong.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Ik snap het niet.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Ik snap het niet.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Ik heb namen.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Wait, I forgot all the Dutch in the world.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
My name

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
is

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Merda. That's terrible.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I have autism too. Oh my god, autism gang.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Gang gang gang gang.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Got the Patreon.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Yeah.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Did you like my Patreon audio? Did you like the demo?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It was so weird.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Like hearing

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
hearing the

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
the Scots.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You know what I'm saying.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The demo audio was good.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Aw, thank you.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Eh.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
You didn't tell us you could speak Dutch.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Nee, ik kan niet.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Was it

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Ik leer Netherlands

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
on dat

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Ik heb

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I had

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Netherlands

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Mensen, Vrenden,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Vrijden. That's German.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I basically used to play Call of Duty with some Dutch folk.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And then, yeah.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Learn some Dutch.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Learn some French as well.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Like if you want to say

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
justice reigns from above in French.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Don't worry.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I've got you, okay?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Place au deluge de la justice.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Dutch is so funny.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Azura was like, I'm learning Dutch.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I'm like, Azura, oh my god.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Azura, I'll teach you.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I'll teach you how to say turtle, okay?

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
You say, oh no!

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
My phone's on 20% battery.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
No.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Sorry, my phone is what I

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I pilot my neck on.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I'm so, ah, my arms are

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
shaking.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Did you hear?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Hello?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Wake up!

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Wake up!

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Okay, there we go.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I just put my charger in.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It's fine, it's fine.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Everything's fine.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Stop!

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Please, please hold still.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
No, I'm sorry.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Please hold still.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Ah, please!

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Oh my god, my PC's screaming at me right now.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
You guys still see me?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
You guys are like, horizontal

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
on my desk right now.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I'm sorry.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Also, I'm really sorry

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
if you're like immersive featureverse.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I'm really bad at this shit!

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I'm piloting my neck on.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I'm doing a terrible job.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You're literally horizontal

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
on my desk right now.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I'm looking down at you like, hi!

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
This is terrible!

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Okay, let me have some more.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Abagando las luces.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Let's see.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The ace.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I mean, it's working, it's working.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I'm just looking a bit funny.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Oh my god.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Alright, let me refocus.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Let me refocus!

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Get it? Cause you're a refling!

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Six, Griffin, Griffin!

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I need to make an audio

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
of a certain nature

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
where I just say reforming over and over.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Oh, my trigong!

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Stopping phone!

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
There's pilot in this met, who's driving this bus?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Please phone, just stay still!

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Stop wiggling!

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.200
Okay, I'm actually I'm gonna start I'm gonna start turning Scots in a minute. I'm getting raging go and just actual sit still

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:21.260
I've got like what freakin give me like 30 minutes of you being still see right wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.200
hold the phone

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.480
No, literally hold the phone get it cuz the fucking phone won't try it right hold on

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.600
Ah

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:40.400
Okay turns out you can put your iPhone sideways and it still tracks you I didn't know that I've just learned that right now

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.080
That's right ladies and gentlemen, I was the one who

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:54.000
Judged you if you're a beach over worthy enough to get in the agency, and I've literally streamed for less than two months myself

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.720
I

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.000
Absolutely terrible. I shouldn't talk about that. I'm sure there's some people really really pissed that didn't pick them. Sorry. I was your barrier

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.120
But please understand we also took into

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.160
Someone can have the perfect voice

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.040
Okay, I'm fine. Ah

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.840
Go away. I get scared. I get scared when management show up. I'm like

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Oh

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:26.680
Leave me alone. Oh, my voice is cracking. Oh crap so much professional

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.800
Big well, right? Let me refresh your questions

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.240
I want you to strong my cuddles until I

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.600
That's such a good sentence. Oh my god

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.240
What do you think of sunken gallery

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.840
Not convinced

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.920
Such operation I know I know I know I know

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.200
Was that the melody of legend of zelda?

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.120
Um

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:20.040
Will you get multiple endings there's multiple endings I've never played I actually don't know much about the game

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.680
I thought it was like you click buttons. That's all I know

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.720
That you click buttons you'll never get I'm really good at clicking buttons, you know what I'm saying

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320
They're all bad endings. Oh, no

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.240
They're multiple. There's tons of endings. I thought it was like one of them quick games

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.400
I

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.880
How did you end up getting to pick the talent when you're just new to the agency is there

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880
Because I'm the creative director

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240
I'm the creative director

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.600
Good ending is when you get your meds. No, oh, maybe take your meds

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.080
And the voices go away, no

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.440
I don't want to play elton ring and then take my meds because then you guys all disappear

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:23.000
Oh my god, do you remember that time we played elton ring and we all like

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.200
We're mimicking something and then someone came in and went bang bang and blew us all up

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.600
How big is the vealer team, I mean it depends if you want to count contractors as well

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.080
It gets pretty juicy if you want to count contractors

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.880
Like we've literally got like four more technical clippers coming in. No

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:56.440
One person's about to be on trial two are like we want them full-time basically. Um, so that adds more people to the website

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.200
Do you count the talents as well? That's another six then technically

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.880
If we disappear who will stream side. Oh, oh, yeah, one of you guys have to come in as the baddie. Wait, what's happening with my arm?

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.680
Oh, what's happening with my arm?

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.040
Oh

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.960
No, I'm gonna have to know you about that a little bit. It's a bit too aggressive

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.240
Are there any big group projects? Yes. Oh my god

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.720
There's such big group projects. I'm so tired

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.360
I planned ahead I planned every month. There's gonna be some sort of event going on at the allure

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.960
Um

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.520
Leave my noodle on. I don't know why my arm breaking

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:49.080
I'll annoy nari about it. Nari was absolutely fantastic when she came to construct in me. She's fantastic

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.200
Um

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.640
You plan on getting 3d models

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.680
Yes, but you're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see the girls 3d

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.520
Put your money where your mouth is give them memberships. Go on the patrons because

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.760
It's expensive because I we would have to buy them the trackers as well

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.600
I actually don't know much about 3d in yet, but I'm pretty sure like you can

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.800
Be our chat model and we can all like touch each other and stuff in there

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520
And we put you

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.320
Will there be group audios yes, there will be group audios and

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.080
There's already one-on-one audios planned with each other

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:34.200
But I didn't know the comfortability level of the girls when we were like at that stage of development

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.560
So so far it's azura and sheepsters

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.680
me and mersey and

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
emmers and icers

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.280
I've not done anything further. I think donathan rewards

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.680
Will most likely be targeted at that stuff and it'll be access

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.160
free to access

01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:01.240
Because I think public donathan rewards are much more satisfactory. Obviously we will have to do the classic

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.240
like first place second place third place and because

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.880
We do need to incentivize and

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Azura and

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.040
Might be in the position to move out if all goes well and she gets the support

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.560
Like monetary like gets monetized and

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.280
All that jazz and if she can move out she can definitely increase her like stream times for you and

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.400
Just find a easier tang

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.040
That's why I'm kind of like support the others because like they're in positions where like oh if I could move out

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.640
I could definitely meet more content stream for longer do this. Do that be more like, you know

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.520
So definitely support that okay

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.360
Can I drill it in your head anymore to support them or?

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.200
Then you like hypnotize you

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.400
Oh, my picture's on twerp right, okay, I'll get that. I'll update it

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.240
Oh, no the

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.280
A veal or house would be awesome, actually

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:11.320
And no the girls are like some of them are like still living with family or

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.720
And so they can't really be like oh like, you know all the time so

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.680
Yeah

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:27.080
We obey we support the girls, but you kindly support the girl. So yeah, um

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.360
That is why

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.880
um, so

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.880
Azura's up first for donathan rewards to kind of give you an idea and

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:45.480
I'm opening to you know farting about and being open to like kind of the stuff you guys would like to see

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.360
Perfectly fine with me no problem

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Um

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:58.280
Are the audios on patreon already done do you mean like edit?

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.240
Um

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.840
Only one month

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.000
It's been done. So like june is done

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:12.120
So the girls responsibilities like contract wise is three streams a week if health permitted. Oh my god

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.240
If health permitted I got asked by one of the girls

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:21.880
I'll just Azura was like, do I need to give you a doctor's note if I'm sick? I'm like, no

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.200
Go rest

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.440
My goodness, if you're not well, you're not well

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.120
um

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:34.840
So if they're in good health, they are to stream a minimum of three times a week and monthly four audios

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.200
I definitely do not want to overwork anyone. I do not want them to feel stressed

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.280
I want them to have good times good vibes

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.160
happy ending

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.400
Yeah

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400
And they've been like super

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.920
Patient and like the behind the scenes stuff going on

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.760
Do you talk often with one each other? Yeah, we're in a we're in a discord. We talk every day

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.080
For two months we've like literally talked every day. Um

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.800
You know some

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.520
Some girls like might feel like awkward around each other

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.080
We had like a couple of gaming sessions leading up to it. We had mock streams together

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.080
I like wholeheartedly feel 100 comfortable around these girls. Um

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:28.200
Like when it comes to collabing with other vtubers outside the agency, unfortunately

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.320
For me personally, I'm quite inappropriate and

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.360
If I don't know the person and I don't know their comfort level. I'm not really interested in like

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.840
Asking for like, oh, you want to do a vtuber club type thing? Um

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.120
So, uh, I'm probably not going to do too many clubs out with the agency unless like the girls vouch for me

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.880
Or something like I'm I'm happy to make friends with their friends

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:56.920
But um, it's probably going to be solo content majority on this channel

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:01.800
And such like content featuring the reeflings when we play our multiplayer games

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.040
um

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.040
Yeah, I

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.320
Um, there is a

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:16.040
Notification discord if you go on the other's twitter. It's notification only the talents are not inside it

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.760
the talents

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.960
Sorry, my voice is like proper feeling it right now

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.680
um

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.320
Yeah, management don't have access. Sorry contractors don't have access to the talent

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:38.040
Talents aren't in the notification discord. There's no way you can groom us. We groom you

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.920
Why am I freaking frog blinking?

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.680
It's me has probably not set up my parameters

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:58.760
One thing get more stable with the group discord for watchers to be joined on the table

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.840
What are you saying? I don't have no idea what you just said to me

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:09.640
Will you hang out say together outside of the collapse? I don't even know if we're gonna have time

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.040
Like collabs are probably just going to be us meman and like catching up unironically. Um,

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.680
Amy's very pumped for

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.680
Minecraft server in july is when that comes out my uh group minecraft server

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.240
and

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.160
I the last time I really properly prolified minecraft

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.280
And this is going to set a few views back. Um

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:43.880
The last update was the plant pots were released and I think witches were released and I like never even play that

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.200
properly beyond that

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.200
So that'll be interesting

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.040
Um, I don't really understand anything beyond it

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.720
um

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:03.640
I think I had to stroke right in that the way I'm stroking right now, baby. Oh stop. Oh my god. Oh

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.200
That's for later, okay

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.840
I'm gonna look in this direction because I think maybe my

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.280
arm doesn't bend that way

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.000
um

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.160
Yeah, Amy's like really excited for me. I don't really know what you're supposed to do in the minecraft game

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.120

You don't pick the wait, you don't pick the oh she the oh she picks you

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.120
Because it's like you never you don't know like you you can give so many v-tubers a try

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.720
And then it's just like one you latch on to and you can't get away from them

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:03.160
Where the things they're not hard for seashells

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:09.960
Isn't it obvious they're seashells like they're transpiring you can see my little hair through them as well if you like look really hard

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.320
Why am I not feels hold on a minute got talk this girl

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.160
I'm a victim

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:30.600
Kind of can you like kind of see the back of my hair through the sea like it's transpired their shells

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:37.880
They're pearlescent shells in my hair. I still have bunches behind it. Like I have I have hair bubbles

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.600
Oh

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.600

Well, I'll put you behind me

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:54.280
It's very uncomfortable. I know some people are like, uh, I find it hard looking uh, uh, whammy in the eyes and I was like, don't be fit

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.280
It's fine. It's fine

01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.240
Don't mind me

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.880
Don't mind me, baby. Oh my god. I love this model. Look at the

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:07.000
I love when models do that neck thing where they only like disappears

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:13.880
It's like the best part like when there is like so much that goes into like picking a model and stuff

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:20.680
I don't like vtuber models where like the art like the hair and the art like is a billion different splits and stuff

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:24.440
Like I don't like that. I like that big chunky hair. I think it looks so

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.320
um

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.320
and like

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.600
I like my pupils as well. Yeah, my little squiddles

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.680
any squiddlers

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.680

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.480
Who's my oh shit at the moment?

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.840
That's actually hard to say

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.680
um

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:55.240
The thing is I've probably not got one right now. I watched like 300 people during those applications

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.960
There's a lot of people I could oh shit

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.080
Um

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.520
I'm thinking

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.000
You've made me use my brain shame on you. Um

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.800
at the moment

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.800
I'm biased to fen

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.800
um

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.840
I just think she's cute and I really like her minds

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:19.160
So fen, fen's got my oh she bolt right now

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.920
A scoreboard for the burps honestly, but well

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.600
I won't make you use your brain again down straight you won't

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.800
Bait or not you better not

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.440
Uh, so did you get applications from other vtubers that you were surprised?

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:43.960
Yeah, there was like pre pre established people and I'm like, what do you want?

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.960
What what why would you want to join you've already got like an entire brand?

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.720
And like thing going on there's literally nothing wrong like they already got their own vtuber models though

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.120
Oh my god, my tongue has physics

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.720
Nari made sure my tongue wiggles are you ready?

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.960
Hey

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.280
Go wiggle physics

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.160
I

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.160
Hey, I'll I'll do a proper hypnosis layer, but my voice is

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.680
Uh, I can only emmy can okay

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.680
So all the models got the same emotions

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.760
But everyone had like a custom toggle or thing going on for them and mine was

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.280
As I move the phone out the way mine was

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.280

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.320

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.640

Oh, I should go back to the chatting so you guys can see yourself

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.800
10 minutes fly by what about infinite time? True

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:06.280
Um, I'm like, um, can I leak my like other stream plans for the rest of the week for the month?

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.520
And I'm like, I'm trying to remember what games I've put down

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:12.200
And I've already forgotten them all but they're good games

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:18.760
So we're gonna do old-school runescape consistently for a little bit because I want to get 99 fishing

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.560
Uh, no, not fishing wrong one 99 cooking because I'm a whammin

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.120
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.560
And that's actually real

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:34.360
true

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.160
um

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.240
So I'm gonna try my best horror games. I have a bad heart

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.800
I don't do pause my heart is fine. I got it checked

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.360
I have to go in if there's any issues. Um

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:53.560
I I can play horror games. It's just ill advised. I would probably do it as like a

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.120
a reward

01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:02.280
without giving the game away oh I know a game I'm playing next week are you guys

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:10.560
ready I'm playing Skyrim full achievements next week because I know

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.160
how to get full achievements in that game because I've done it a few times

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:21.400
before and obviously Skyrim belongs to the North thank you very much I'll be

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:30.080
Stormcloaks yep don't care what they say you know I'm all for Talos

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:38.520
praise be to Talos so that's my duration game for next week is Skyrim

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:46.080
first I believe it takes me just over 24 hours to do full achievements and we

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.880
kind of you kind of cheat at the start because you do if you do the

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:54.200
companion's quest line first and then go back to the save before it so you're

01:50:54.200 --> 01:51:01.520
not a werewolf and then do the vampire quest the problem I don't know if it's

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:12.880
gonna be a problem if I use an Xbox pass for it because because my Xbox would

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:23.120
break so many times trying to play Skyrim because the save file issues and I

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:27.840
if it's gonna be the same way then there's a strategical way to get full

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:31.600
achievements via the Xbox I already know how to do it I've done it a few times so

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.880
don't worry I'll lay it all out for you baby I'll show you how to get full

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.880
achievements in Skyrim and under 24 hours that'll be my challenge in under 24

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:44.040
hours I'm sure you can do it under way less but I don't know the strats I'm not

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.360
a speedrunner

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:54.920
yes I had a girl ghost me because I told her you picked stormcloth what why

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.960
would anyone pick the legion sorry but the elves can perish you're no coming

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:03.040
into my home country being like no you're not allowed to praise Talos

mom was like if you always if you follow your instincts you'll always win

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:53.520
because it doesn't mean you have to win or lose just follow how you feel and

01:52:53.520 --> 01:53:01.400
life is good because team mystic is for like wise people and then team red I

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:09.240
