1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
I can feel you kicking again.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,520
You just can't wait to come out into this beautiful world and see me, hmm?

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,160
I can't wait to see you either, little one.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,320
It's hard to believe one day you won't be in my tummy.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,120
It feels like I've known you forever.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,200
Technically, you've known me forever, haven't you?

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,480
Since you were a tiny, little cell, and now you're so big and strong,

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,040
kicking me daily to tell me how you're awake and wanting me to talk to you, hmm?

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:58,280
Well, why don't I tell you about my day since you like hearing me ramble?

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,280
You know you're a pretty predictable little one.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,600
You've already stopped kicking.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Have you fallen asleep before I've even gotten started?

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,840
Well, we had a nice bath earlier, didn't we?

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,160
I had some lovely coconut oil to rub on my tummy because you are getting so big

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,280
that you're giving me stretch marks.

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,760
But that's okay.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,280
If I have stretch marks because of you, it'll make me happy

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,800
because you are the one to give me them and they'll always be a part of me.

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,520
I get to look back on them and remember things like this,

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,640
where I was rubbing my belly and you were napping away after kicking me.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,120
I adore you already.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,520
I really do.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,040
You also liked how nice and warm the water felt when we were in the bath together.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,440
I think you were napping though,

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,880
but I was swirling the water around to get more bubbles made.

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,080
Then I made some delicious snacks for us both.

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,560
You seem to already have a taste for things, Ellie.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,240
You're the perfect mini-me that I can pour all of my love into, hmm?

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,200
The question is, will you be fussy when you come out?

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,880
Or will you eat just like your mummy?

31
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,800
I hope I've had enough vegetables, so you'll be okay to eat them too.

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,200
I need you to be as healthy as possible.

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,760
And we can do so many fun things together, can't we dear?

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,160
The thought of holding you in my arms just fills me with so much joy.

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,440
I could cry, but I would be happy tears.

36
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,880
It's not your fault, though.

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,520
It's the pregnancy hormones that make me go haywire.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,120
It just means that I get to give you even more love

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
that I never thought was even possible.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,880
Hmm.

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,000
You know, before I found out I was pregnant when you cutie pie,

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I never wanted to be a mummy.

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,680
The thought scared me so much, and yet you changed my mind about it all.

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I can't picture myself without you in my life.

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:55,320
Maybe I'm skipping so far ahead because I haven't seen your adorable face yet.

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,240
I can't wait to see your first big smile and your adorable eyes.

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,960
Well, you have big eyes, just like me.

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,880
My friends told me that their babies were pretty restless,

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,840
but will you be soothed by my voice, just like you are now?

50
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't have the strongest singing voice, but

51
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,960
all of eyes are always recommended to help a little one sleep.

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,920
Are you gonna make me sing for you, hmm, refund?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Anything for you?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Flew a sack, Flew a sack.

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,760
Don't mess up, Don't mess up.

56
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,120
Sonne la mattina, Sonne la mattina.

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,760
Ding, ding, dong, Ding, ding, dong.

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:00,760
I should probably try and learn more little advice for you.

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:08,760
My mom used to think to me a lot, and I get to do it for you now.

60
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Maybe it's something I can teach you when you get a bit older,

61
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,760
to never shy away from a challenge.

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Some people get embarrassed, nervous, or scared to do things that they aren't so good at,

63
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,000
but you?

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I want you to push through those emotions.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,360
I don't want you to hold back.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:48,040
I truly want the best for you, and I'll try everything so I can make it happen.

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,800
Sometimes I even doubt myself if I know what I'm doing.

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,360
I've been reading pregnancy books for you, books on how to parent,

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,920
books on how to juggle my personal life as a mother, but I don't want a personal life.

70
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,680
I want you to be my life, my legacy.

71
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,080
You're my everything, little reef one.

72
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,760
Only a few more weeks until I can listen to you coo for the first time.

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,080
I can feed you for the first time, I can truly look after you.

74
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,680
My body has given almost everything it can to make you.

75
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,800
Now it's time for my mind to teach you everything I can about being a good person.

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,320
I have no doubts you will be though.

77
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,520
You'll take after me over time.

78
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:02,680
The thought process of your rebellious stage actually fills me with happiness, believe it or not.

79
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:10,360
Toddler tantrums, they call it, but it's because you're feeling such big feelings for the first time.

80
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,240
Everything's really new to you.

81
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,760
I'll scoop you up in my arms, jump you up and down on the spot,

82
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,600
and start dancing with you until you feel better.

83
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Now we can talk about it afterwards, about what might have hurt you.

84
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,360
I never want anything to hurt you.

85
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,640
I can't even bear the thought forget it actually happening.

86
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,520
I suppose I do maybe need to babyproof the house when you start moving around.

87
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
Now tell me, it's rumbling away.

88
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,600
The question is, is that me or you making those noises?

89
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,840
That honestly had no idea that pregnancy could be so loud, huh?

90
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:10,120
Are you going to be my rambunctious boy when you're out screaming your head off?

91
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,840
I wonder what the future will hold for you darling.

92
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,640
You don't have to be anything you don't want to be.

93
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:30,520
Oh, it's a scary world to navigate, but you'll always have me to ask advice from.

94
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,240
You can get a big cuddle on everyone when things get a little too much.

95
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,080
It is not a sign of weakness, no.

96
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,360
It's a sign of strength to be emotionally vulnerable.

97
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,600
I'll know I've raised you right when you feel comfortable enough to cry at yourself.

98
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Oh baby, it's completely natural.

99
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,640
That's how we get stressed out.

100
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:10,200
Life is so hard to navigate, especially when you feel like there's no help in hand.

101
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,920
Promise me.

102
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,360
Deep down inside, you know that I can guide you.

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,320
I can help you.

104
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,600
You're never alone, little leaflet.

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,360
You just need to let me know what's wrong and when we can fix anything for you.

106
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,920
And on the subject about your future,

107
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,880
it's hard to find motivation these days so easily.

108
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,400
I hope you can find a job that occupies your time, but it doesn't cause you stress.

109
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Maybe I'm asking for America.

110
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,720
I don't know what the world is going to look like when you're older.

111
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Your mommy got very lucky though, against all odds, even with a voice like this.

112
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,360
She gets to make audios that help others that don't feel so good.

113
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,720
Sometimes I get to have a little joke here and there, but I like to think that

114
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:32,680
I put people who struggle with sleep to sleep, or a smile here and there when they listen to

115
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,760
something silly I make.

116
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm gonna say something to you.

117
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,080
That might not make sense, but it will in the future.

118
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,440
I know it because you're gonna be a little meanie.

119
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,400
Some believe it is only great power that can hold evil check.

120
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,680
But that is not what I have found.

121
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:06,840
It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.

122
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,480
Small acts of kindness and love.

123
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm going to raise you don't feel like fantasy, but if you don't it's okay.

124
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,680
Anything that makes you happy will make me happy.

125
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:32,680
The world really can be a scary place, but people like us, little reeflings, we can make

126
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,720
a small difference to others.

127
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,080
I don't want you to be famous and have your name remembered on a statue.

128
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,680
I don't want you to be make a rich and have a paint house.

129
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,280
I want you happy, comfortable and living a good life.

130
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Doing good for others if and when you can.

131
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,880
I have no doubts you will make me proud with everything you do.

132
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,680
You're not kicking anymore?

133
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Is that you asleep?

134
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Well, I might be sneaky and give you some positive affirmation to it.

135
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I might even tell you a little story to go with it.

136
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,680
You do seem to enjoy my stories for some reason.

137
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Maybe I'm just that good at going on a tangent.

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,480
I am growing and I am going at my own pace.

139
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,480
I don't ever want you thinking you're in competition with anyone around you.

140
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,480
This is your lifestyle and please live it to your heart's content.

141
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,480
Your mummy struggled growing up a little.

142
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,480
I wasn't always so social as I am now.

143
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Would you believe me if I told you I was so scared of the outside world that I never went

144
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
outside for two years?

145
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
That's true.

146
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,480
I was so in my own head.

147
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:31,480
I caused my own misery and it didn't help seeing past friends achieve so much.

148
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
But now?

149
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Well, I am completely fulfilled because I have you darling.

150
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
You complete me.

151
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
You really do.

152
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I've only I could give you a few kisses right now but I have to wait until you get here.

153
00:13:51,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I am optimistic because today is a new day.

154
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Now, this is a good one because I might pass this trait on to you.

155
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm not sure how much you'll be like me but every day is a new day for me.

156
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,480
When I have a big sleep, I'm ready for whatever the next day brings to me.

157
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,480
It sounds silly and very basic but I think you should take things one day at a time.

158
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:39,480
If you look too far ahead or too far back, you're going to miss the moment you're in

159
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
and then it's gone.

160
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Maybe it's different for everyone else but I have a hunch you're going to adopt a lot of my mannerisms.

161
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:07,480
I am worthy of investing in myself and this one concerns me because I'm 99% sure that you're a boy

162
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,480
and because of that, I'm worried you're not going to be kind to yourself.

163
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I can't make demands that you treat yourself to nice things but I hope over time you realize

164
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
you're more than worth it.

165
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,480
I'll try and think of a few examples.

166
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Sometimes it can be as small as buying yourself a nice smelling shampoo or a sweet treat from a bakery

167
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,480
or quality of life items.

168
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,480
I already know you're going to be addicted to gaming just like me.

169
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I'll try and spoil you with the best of.

170
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Maybe a chair that actually is good for your posture.

171
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,480
I think that would be a good investment.

172
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Those are silly examples but they do hold the little truth to them, little ones.

173
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:20,480
But please though, my little refling, I urge you to engage in your interest.

174
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,480
That curiosity I had as a child, I still have that.

175
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
I never grew out of it.

176
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,480
That one parent asked me,

177
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Oh, Strony, when will you grow up?

178
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I never have and I don't plan on it.

179
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
I get excited when it rains for an afternoon nap.

180
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,480
I enjoy seeing the seasons change and new flowers bloom on my walks.

181
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I like the feeling of the sun kissing my face when I go out in the garden

182
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,480
or feeding the birds some scraps and watching them pick away at them.

183
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Please.

184
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
My dear sweet,

185
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
I never was that innocent.

186
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Carry it with you at all times.

187
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
That naivety,

188
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
that's a part of me.

189
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,480
It has hurt me countless times

190
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
and yet it remains.

191
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I am naive and I am innocent

192
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,480
and I can enjoy life to the fullest.

193
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Don't close your heart, little one.

194
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Not to me or anyone.

195
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,480
You will learn over time

196
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
my heart's the love, but

197
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,480
it's better to have love than ever at all.

198
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Don't you think?

199
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I love you so much

200
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,480
as you sleep inside my tummy

201
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,480
soon to come into this world.

202
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,480
We have a few sleepless nights ahead of us, don't we?

203
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
But for now

204
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,480
you are safe in my womb.

205
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Warm.

206
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,480
You can hear me rambling.

207
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Well, my tummy's probably making all sorts of noises.

208
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I'll always be here for you.

209
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Mommy's getting a little tired, though.

210
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Maybe all of your kicking was put in me asleep, hm?

211
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I do wish it wouldn't take up so much room.

212
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
It feels like a new pee every ever, though.

213
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,480
For now, however,

214
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,480
why don't we be cheeky

215
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,480
and have a nap together, hm?

216
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,480
I love you, dear Refling.

217
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Hm, hm.

218
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,480
I love you.

219
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,480
I love you.

220
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,480
I love you.

221
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I love you.

222
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I love you.

223
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
I love you.

224
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I love you.

225
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I love you.

226
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
I love you.

227
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
I love you.

228
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,480
I love you.

229
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,480
I love you.

230
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
I love you.

231
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I love you.

232
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I love you.

233
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
I love you.

234
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I love you.

235
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I love you.

236
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,480
I love you.

237
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,480
I love you.

238
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
I love you.

239
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,480
I love you.

240
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,480
I love you.

241
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,480
I love you.

242
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
I love you.

243
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I love you.
